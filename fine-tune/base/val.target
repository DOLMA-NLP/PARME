eng_Latn wait till lie wakes, and be patient.
eng_Latn each man and each woman has another allotted to it for life, whom it supports, by whom it is supported
eng_Latn of his wife and baby
eng_Latn Thank you!
eng_Latn Penguins keep baby penguins warm by holding them very close.
eng_Latn she could not stand it.
eng_Latn he had committed in pursuing and eventually allowing him self to fail into this unhallowed relationship with her
eng_Latn he said, raising his hat
eng_Latn I explained to her that I had no parents.
eng_Latn I pulled off my shoes and stockings
eng_Latn whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds.
eng_Latn I shook my head and repressed a shudder at the thought of how close I had been to being too late today.
eng_Latn I can even say definitely that it was a marriage of affection.
eng_Latn I have to get to my desk.
eng_Latn I expect some friends every moment.
eng_Latn I know you didn't mean to but you DID do it.
eng_Latn Everyone run to the right!
eng_Latn I hain't been gone anywheres.
eng_Latn covered with aquatic plants
eng_Latn I must know more about it.
eng_Latn Almost...nearly..
eng_Latn at least they were never known to do so in that country.
eng_Latn or else I must run round to the porter's lodge.
eng_Latn if you ever want to see him at all.
eng_Latn for the danger was imminent.
eng_Latn I think Pug and I know where we would like to go camping now Granny Pug.
eng_Latn I will never do that.
eng_Latn they turned into a dark room they were passing
eng_Latn it will be the duty of you gentlemen to givethe defendant the benefit of the doubt raised.
eng_Latn then all cast down their eyes and sat silent.
eng_Latn was in danger
eng_Latn gesturing him to the ground.
eng_Latn you deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.
eng_Latn probably without seeing us.
eng_Latn ...who discovered a new way topaint pictures in Paris in 1903.
eng_Latn I love you dearly.
eng_Latn I'd expose one of his secrets.
eng_Latn Where exactly are we Granny Pug?
eng_Latn I called out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice.
eng_Latn on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon.
eng_Latn I insist on seeing the will.
eng_Latn my child is there!
eng_Latn I cut the page right out of the book.
eng_Latn I am incapable of doing so, he said.
eng_Latn there was no longer anything to spare.
eng_Latn I am going away soon, I expect.
eng_Latn I only hope they won't make me!
eng_Latn Bet you can t see me now Dog.
eng_Latn hang it, we don't want the small pox, you see.
eng_Latn that's how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen.
eng_Latn I was yesterday taken by surprise, and saw it superficially.
eng_Latn I'm going to finish writing down everything we did!
eng_Latn her spirits rose.
eng_Latn I found both the brothers intent upon me.
eng_Latn but he might come along in the morning to visit his mother.
eng_Latn Oooh.
eng_Latn I shall need you.
eng_Latn fine de scissors without takin' all night 'bout it.
eng_Latn I hain't ever done you no harm.
eng_Latn she hastened from the room.
eng_Latn to describe the state of mind in which she hadapproached him
eng_Latn but she sat in the chair
eng_Latn I love books that are full of fun.
eng_Latn I had left it on the divan, and it had been picked up.
eng_Latn for in time I may be able to support myself and help the girls.
eng_Latn That s because I haven t starteddrawing yet.
eng_Latn I don t know mice. But it might bemice to think about it!
eng_Latn but he might be rendered unhappy
eng_Latn perhaps he exaggerated.
eng_Latn wrapped herself up, without opening her lips.
eng_Latn think of some way by which they could meet before, if possible.
eng_Latn to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.
eng_Latn his head peering abovethe edge of the hollow road.
eng_Latn last night he had awakened briefly
eng_Latn then he too left.
eng_Latn I lurched away from him, my hand tight over my mouth.
eng_Latn I think I got a bit carried away with my directing Dog.
eng_Latn one single soldier left behind
eng_Latn at this stage any influence I might once have had is completely gone.
eng_Latn they will carry you ashore?
eng_Latn especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.
eng_Latn but she had given her word that she would return that same evening.
eng_Latn I have to sit there and pretend to be a good employee.
eng_Latn I don't care how merry you are at my expense this morning
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn he rang his little bell again
eng_Latn whether he admitted it or not.
eng_Latn crying in a hoarse sort of screech
eng_Latn shading his face with his hand.
eng_Latn it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation.
eng_Latn I say this because, if we could not find my lady's palaces or castles to night
eng_Latn I patted her hand.
eng_Latn to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants.
eng_Latn his emphatic speech
eng_Latn he looked at her, her clean and shining face.
eng_Latn the old scamp will be condemned.
eng_Latn but one can't help complaining sometimes.
eng_Latn Do you know a rhyme that starts...
eng_Latn I had heard of it before.
eng_Latn but the cowherd would not have her.
eng_Latn to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move
eng_Latn I'm sure my sewing girl hasn't any doubt but that it exists!
eng_Latn I noticed her wild eyes.
eng_Latn B-but only in a nice way. We have presents. I have - soap.
eng_Latn her melancholy was just like the august melancholy
eng_Latn two layers of fabric worn through.
eng_Latn I stood upon the hearth rug
eng_Latn read books of poetry and tell negroes what to do.
eng_Latn if you look around, I'm sure you'll find various poisons in the house.
eng_Latn I shouldn't trouble.
eng_Latn without daily watering from the city mains the arid climate had triumphed
eng_Latn but did not think it wise to betray the fact.
eng_Latn while the adventures toward the far white wall ceased altogether.
eng_Latn Are you alright Pug?
eng_Latn I held out my hand
eng_Latn So that s where the feather came from. I ll put it in here for safety.
eng_Latn though he had already been punished over this lesson.
eng_Latn from which place, he was to despatch, a constable and doctor.
eng_Latn the other's that cub that
eng_Latn she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart
eng_Latn if one of those new automobiles had not suddenly driven across the mudhole of the patio
eng_Latn so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
eng_Latn that is so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.
eng_Latn then he stopped short.
eng_Latn He must be very brave.
eng_Latn it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the conditionof man.
eng_Latn I floundered around in my head, trying to remember how to close it.
eng_Latn but he was afraid that the governor would change his mind and order the dead body to be removed earlier
eng_Latn where they might decently submerge themselves until themisery
eng_Latn Is it a big book Dog?
eng_Latn tears in her eyes at the jeering note in his voice.
eng_Latn but since dinner the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so somber
eng_Latn though they were still there.
eng_Latn I thought he was mad.
eng_Latn but have no fear for me.
eng_Latn I have had a few aches and pains lately
eng_Latn she managed to overcome her fear
eng_Latn but generally they take care not to succeed.
eng_Latn but I require a strong mind to smile on my last moments.
eng_Latn he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows.
eng_Latn The Magic Pencil.
eng_Latn evidently for no other purpose than our entertainment.
eng_Latn I did the wolf whined
eng_Latn so now you know.
eng_Latn I tell her she ought to leave it alone.
eng_Latn it is superfluous for me to tell you
eng_Latn I gave her another truth and another analogy.
eng_Latn now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason.
eng_Latn hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.
eng_Latn how long he was in the creature's clutches
eng_Latn I only noticed it later.
eng_Latn I didn't recognize my voice when I answered.
eng_Latn gesturing him to the ground.
eng_Latn horror struck by his own daring
eng_Latn I must also return to the feast.
eng_Latn my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney
eng_Latn stood before me, and looked at me attentively.
eng_Latn for it does not deserve it, as ye shall soon see.
eng_Latn but the world is full of knives just lying around waiting to be picked up.
eng_Latn commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself
eng_Latn then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.
eng_Latn tempers were running high.
eng_Latn (blowing)
eng_Latn the great adventure itself must be a dream!
eng_Latn but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day.
eng_Latn I won't go without finding out.
eng_Latn Excellent work Pug.
eng_Latn Aah! Again! Again!
eng_Latn the irons, the irons!
eng_Latn I pulled out my keys and reached over the top of him to open the back door.
eng_Latn there had been no time for anything except love.
eng_Latn twenty three years ago
eng_Latn I have no doubt she did.
eng_Latn but it seems to me these guys don't get to the top without trampling over a few people on the way.
eng_Latn I took him down several times, you know, in my way.
eng_Latn I never mean to.
eng_Latn I wasn't aware that she did anything special.
eng_Latn you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather avoid.
eng_Latn I stumbled and wished all the time that I could bail out.
eng_Latn or even to come again to morrow.
eng_Latn knocking over chair and table.
eng_Latn there was that little pucker between her eyes again.
eng_Latn he would have something to fight for, something to die for, if need be!
eng_Latn that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel.
eng_Latn her whole body seemed to swell up like a bullfrog's.
eng_Latn then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked the others
eng_Latn I'm telling him to come to dinner.
eng_Latn I am his son.
eng_Latn slapped her left hand on its biceps in a fascinating
eng_Latn one cannot be completely happy in this world!
eng_Latn never had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him, had there been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year,
eng_Latn though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar.
eng_Latn solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me.
eng_Latn but then she is used to my voice.
eng_Latn found relief in the beetle
eng_Latn grasped one of the tufty plants firmly
eng_Latn covered with aquatic plants
eng_Latn with still endless room left over to suffer in.
eng_Latn he means to be more the master under your name than in his own.
eng_Latn I still can't stand to look at a bathtub.
eng_Latn but for his lack of respect for an old man who had not done anyone any harm.
eng_Latn I think he's worried that things are going to change now that you've moved in.
eng_Latn began walking up and down the room
eng_Latn glanced towards me.
eng_Latn pinning the hand holding the knife to the muddy ground.
eng_Latn I used to brush her hair for her every evening.
eng_Latn I searched this room carefully before lunch.
eng_Latn but I hope it's really hurting him
eng_Latn maybe, who knows, the upturned boat with hishat and her veil discovered!
eng_Latn he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.
eng_Latn return to the bosom of common sense
eng_Latn It is very gloomy under there.
eng_Latn 4. he is ready to bear pain for the comfort of others
eng_Latn I first saw the Great Splendina performing her incredible triple back-flip, single finger somersault at-
eng_Latn Let's go somewhere that s more…
eng_Latn waited an hour and a half.
eng_Latn but he turns out ill tempered and exigeant
eng_Latn he had a very indefinite notion of what it consisted in
eng_Latn Famous Artists of the World.
eng_Latn she knew immediately why he had come back.
eng_Latn but which had protected him from an awareness of his age.
eng_Latn professing he would be glad to receive further information.
eng_Latn he felt a little nervous and embarrassed.
eng_Latn the scheme to return home with his brother pirates
eng_Latn he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance
eng_Latn to be able to solve so delicate a question
eng_Latn you two come right after us
eng_Latn I like to have the house an' one a them, she said.
eng_Latn moody pacing down the galleries, looking for something among the pictures
eng_Latn Daisies...dairies .Aah ..diaries!
eng_Latn a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds!
eng_Latn but having very little corresponding fibre in himself
eng_Latn he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture.
eng_Latn for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.
eng_Latn I could have you arrested for that.
eng_Latn he was a widower
eng_Latn Umm A magic top hat...
eng_Latn desired them to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries
eng_Latn this jovial old man had always had good health.
eng_Latn have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom
eng_Latn I would never be an instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.
eng_Latn that is joy
eng_Latn resuming her work
eng_Latn but I took no notice.
eng_Latn us standing off and on in the old WALRUS.
eng_Latn I would never be an instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.
eng_Latn Being brave means different things to different people Dog.
eng_Latn for on the first we drew entirely blank.
eng_Latn there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the main sail.
eng_Latn I reached in and stole power from him.
eng_Latn Alien invaders Major Amazing!
eng_Latn her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in.
eng_Latn expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least
eng_Latn I told her my heart belongs to you
eng_Latn that my body was all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other animals
eng_Latn I told the emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in my way.
eng_Latn that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on hishead.
eng_Latn when he showed him the chair so that he could sit down
eng_Latn I was left as weak as ever I had been
eng_Latn that a man of character should devote his energies to plotting and intrigues
eng_Latn I drew my note book from my pocket.
eng_Latn This is Lee.
eng_Latn one, on the staircase at dawn.
eng_Latn if we can come to terms
eng_Latn I was your equal at eighteen quite your equal.
eng_Latn Oh thank you Dog and Pug. I'm so very lonely here and castles aren t much good at conversation.
eng_Latn today I quit my job
eng_Latn let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes.
eng_Latn I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning.
eng_Latn I wrap the chenille throw around me even more tightly
eng_Latn or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people
eng_Latn their branches not beginning until a few feet over our heads.
eng_Latn who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing.
eng_Latn others were in prison because they had committed crimes of passion or succumbed to a momentary temptation
eng_Latn I hope I shan't have to go any further.
eng_Latn I will never do that.
eng_Latn scratched and bruised but otherwise unharmed.
eng_Latn for the second time his ship was utterly lost
eng_Latn lost his temper
eng_Latn I never much believed in neither of THEM.
eng_Latn he gathered the men of the village in his little room
eng_Latn but because she was determined that one day her grandmother was going to come crawling to her.
eng_Latn but if you can't keep up your end, we will stand our loss, of course,
eng_Latn why, then the pack saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this gentleman has said.
eng_Latn I got to think what happens to me.
eng_Latn but he knew he would have to broach the subject to his mother very carefully.
eng_Latn this ringing, high pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.
eng_Latn it suffices to give one's life for a conviction or a loyalty.
eng_Latn but he chose rather to let me hold him in my hand during our conversation.
eng_Latn but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden
eng_Latn even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear.
eng_Latn but I took no notice.
eng_Latn With pleasure...
eng_Latn but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him
eng_Latn I came out and saw demons.
eng_Latn Not that way?
eng_Latn I asked you to get out.
eng_Latn he panted and then he whirled upon the judge.
eng_Latn Umm..It must be lonely here.
eng_Latn well stitched together with hempen threads of my own making.
eng_Latn the poor boy was in a state of deep affliction.
eng_Latn but at the last instant swept low to the snow
eng_Latn but he still had to duck
eng_Latn Oh How lovely, it looks just like me.
eng_Latn while he read this long and painful letter
eng_Latn conducting me into the house.
eng_Latn something she had seen.
eng_Latn until he almost lay along the animal's spine
eng_Latn Here s here.
eng_Latn the ceiling blackened.
eng_Latn I don't believe you!
eng_Latn as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair.
eng_Latn I put my left hand in his
eng_Latn then the keeper touched him on the arm, and he turned and went back to breaking stone.
eng_Latn she took a few steps after me.
eng_Latn she sat down
eng_Latn I wheel round furiously round to face him.
eng_Latn I think that's very unfair,' I said.
eng_Latn She s not cold.
eng_Latn I saw him
eng_Latn the pads of his palms bulged
eng_Latn That s him! The Lesser Spotted Kraken! I ll find my camera - you steer the sub!
eng_Latn I knew him
eng_Latn he reached out to clasp her hand.
eng_Latn I went and knelt beside him.
eng_Latn Since my early days as an inventor I have dreamt of a laboratory in space and making artificial life.
eng_Latn he resolutely entered the church.
eng_Latn but I don't want to do so anymore!
eng_Latn take out a little phial and a little glass you will find there, quick!
eng_Latn introduced him into society
eng_Latn but like men who rode canons' mules
eng_Latn for, from the very first she had made it plain that he was a member of the family who owned the factory.
eng_Latn who had come out of nowhere and risen to the top by virtue of her own merits.
eng_Latn I had not thought of that.
eng_Latn I felt there was something between us.
eng_Latn whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on the right hand
eng_Latn but he had not yet hit the bulls's eye twenty times out of twenty two.
eng_Latn I got a feelin' I oughta go away an' let 'em be.
eng_Latn its where he ought to be
eng_Latn with incredible accuracy and nimbleness
eng_Latn I read of it yesterday by chance.
eng_Latn I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all
eng_Latn I have remained until now simply because of my devotion to you, and as for danger
eng_Latn for the second time in my life only the second time I became insensible from terror.
eng_Latn so the mention of his name
eng_Latn I was perfectly bewildered.
eng_Latn though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.
eng_Latn I love you dearly.
eng_Latn I have had a few aches and pains lately
eng_Latn I felt his soul depart.
eng_Latn I am going to marry.
eng_Latn you persist in telling him to his face that it's fortunate he is going
eng_Latn no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety
eng_Latn the great adventure itself must be a dream!
eng_Latn that thoughtful eye was dry.
eng_Latn but it would make him yearn for her all the more.
eng_Latn peered over the edge.
eng_Latn extorting almost as much outward homage
eng_Latn then I dunno I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.
eng_Latn but when I came to it and opened it I saw that it was a garden room
eng_Latn youre my friend.
eng_Latn I must go and put the car away.
eng_Latn for though both were fine lads in their way
eng_Latn Dog and Pug, ye make her look theother way while I grabs the hat.
eng_Latn I cherished no malice towards him
eng_Latn every instant of that night was markedby a joy for him.
eng_Latn I gave her another truth and another analogy.
eng_Latn I didn't like it, either.
eng_Latn they had almost ruined their health.
eng_Latn that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship
eng_Latn it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it
eng_Latn the crew began to man the capstan bars.
eng_Latn I'll save him for you!
eng_Latn I can even say definitely that it was a marriage of affection.
eng_Latn with his forehead crushed in.
eng_Latn I did not say that I desired you to do it.
eng_Latn especially as he might be come to pay a farewell visit.
eng_Latn then she shivered at the touch of a hand on her sleeve
eng_Latn I clung with both hands
eng_Latn It's no good. This fog is so thick all I can see is this fog.
eng_Latn I'd already put this off too long.
eng_Latn you only told us
eng_Latn I will never do it!
eng_Latn all of them smelling chicken.
eng_Latn Bow-OW.
eng_Latn she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.
eng_Latn I said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
eng_Latn you have an opinion of your own and are not afraid to have it.
eng_Latn I told him how my cousin wished me to visit him, because he was sick
eng_Latn Pug. Would you join me over hereplease?
eng_Latn I went and saw her mother the other day.
eng_Latn if they come here after him
eng_Latn Not before I reveal the answer to this mystery.
eng_Latn she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.
eng_Latn I didn't take it!
eng_Latn I've a mind to take the watch back.
eng_Latn it there was a what there
eng_Latn it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!
eng_Latn I felt my body go rigid.
eng_Latn I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my hands.
eng_Latn then she looked at him
eng_Latn the woman, who may not have been there.
eng_Latn there they are, just as she used them, unwashed and untouched.
eng_Latn I think that's very unfair,' I said.
eng_Latn The same place I acquired mine.
eng_Latn was that the one she needed most kept aloof
eng_Latn I must get money somewhere at least fifty dollars.
eng_Latn the little gallipot of a boat that we were in
eng_Latn but like men who rode canons' mules
eng_Latn Now Pug! Now! Reverse!
eng_Latn why not our young priestess too!
eng_Latn more fight in her.
eng_Latn our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered,
eng_Latn it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at an end.
eng_Latn they will see him come back a horse boy.
eng_Latn adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued
eng_Latn although on the lake the day before he had been deciding
eng_Latn Just like the bridge in the book, this see-saw needs to be strengthened. So, who s going to help me?
eng_Latn I'm ashamed of you for crying.
eng_Latn he was still in want of quiet.
eng_Latn she impulsively bent forward and kissed her reflection in the mirror
eng_Latn I will reflect.
eng_Latn he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity.
eng_Latn really he only ran a few steps alone.
eng_Latn with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.
eng_Latn we ought to support our cossacks
eng_Latn I got a bit carried away with my competition!
eng_Latn But now...
eng_Latn handsome moving toward her as she entered the room.
eng_Latn ..I love books that can teach you new things.
eng_Latn I want to drink, and especially to drink with you.
eng_Latn Dog likes being Dog.
eng_Latn this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk
eng_Latn but was the lodestone that had given them both so many happy hours.
eng_Latn There s just one thing Dog?
eng_Latn if we can come to terms
eng_Latn shipwrecked in a very remote country
eng_Latn A long time ago people had to findtheir way across the sea by the shapes they saw in the stars.
eng_Latn at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of
eng_Latn Read a map? I love reading everything!
eng_Latn he knew about it beforehand.
eng_Latn Then how about a book?
eng_Latn when, looking up, her eyes met his dull despairing glance
eng_Latn with its head upon her breast.
eng_Latn I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.
eng_Latn my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney
eng_Latn they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.
eng_Latn do not keep me waiting
eng_Latn he came to a very keen realization that all was not well with her.
eng_Latn we lack the courage to step from our accustomed role
eng_Latn this would cause inquiries
eng_Latn he was not diminutive
eng_Latn I was a merchant
eng_Latn the cousin staggered
eng_Latn even though the office was dark.
eng_Latn he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him.
eng_Latn I wondered if she'd even bothered to go in?
eng_Latn told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.
eng_Latn the familiar excitement making her pulse leap.
eng_Latn but my squire will inform you who I am.
eng_Latn with the sign burnt off with a plumber's blowflame
eng_Latn he again seized his trumpet
eng_Latn I was nearly shouting to you,
eng_Latn but now the red blood had rushed back to his cheeks in a torrent.
eng_Latn but still he had been in his mind
eng_Latn I said that we must put off going for three days
eng_Latn when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death.
eng_Latn has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely.
eng_Latn you came out of your mother's womb without a government
eng_Latn to recapture his audience
eng_Latn I KNEW you would ask about him!
eng_Latn that the essential function of a work of art was to please.
eng_Latn A holiday? A holiday? It's been along time since I had a...
eng_Latn before he put it clumsily into the lock
eng_Latn that I shall perhaps never use!
eng_Latn it seemed certain that they had him.
eng_Latn save me again!
eng_Latn I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.
eng_Latn with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded
eng_Latn a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.
eng_Latn she had gauged her quarry well, the gross old spider.
eng_Latn I promised, on the road, to write to her.
eng_Latn of my mother lying there beneath the tree I knew so well.
eng_Latn but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us.
eng_Latn I cherished no malice towards him
eng_Latn I get the feeling you don't like me so very goddam much.
eng_Latn few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.
eng_Latn it didn't take too long for the car to become stuffy and hot
eng_Latn And so Billy Barker s factory became a place that made many kinds of treats for dogs AND cats, and they all lived biscuity ever after! The end.
eng_Latn why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?
eng_Latn left him there, alone
eng_Latn but the other two didn't even look back.
eng_Latn I must have hurt you very much.
eng_Latn maybe you'd like to take a midnight swim with me?
eng_Latn Janice and Dave in the jungle.
eng_Latn Umm How curious.
eng_Latn over biscuit and fried junk.
eng_Latn because it was the forgetfulness of death.
eng_Latn a slave does not dictate to a master
eng_Latn I was intrigued.
eng_Latn already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!
eng_Latn then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.
eng_Latn for something very profound had changed in his heart
eng_Latn but he soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.
eng_Latn when,half distracted,he had rushed to the count's house
eng_Latn growing confused, and constantly losing the thread of his ideas.
eng_Latn told me things.
eng_Latn no help to be had.
eng_Latn I hoped to save her life before I killed the monster.
eng_Latn I didn't know how to reach you.
eng_Latn detach himself from the complaining crowd
eng_Latn but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn't hear.
eng_Latn I had someone else waiting for me.
eng_Latn crying her eyes out
eng_Latn I never shall see my pretty darling again.
eng_Latn my mouth dry.
eng_Latn also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain
eng_Latn made no offer to leave the room
eng_Latn he had a very good time.
eng_Latn poured out another glassful of brandy
eng_Latn I can't stay here no more.
eng_Latn when he heard it yet again.
eng_Latn Sixteen shells and a...
eng_Latn Yippee. Ho ho Ho
eng_Latn if it does come, while we live to see it triumph
eng_Latn while the evening slowly deepened into night.
eng_Latn I never saw you for an instant.
eng_Latn I have truly pointed out to you and in allhelpfulness the only way the only way
eng_Latn I tell you at forty a man's a fool or his doctor
eng_Latn all of them smelling chicken.
eng_Latn he discovered that the paving continued.
eng_Latn I took her face in my hand.
eng_Latn looking around him once more.
eng_Latn but that all others who disagreed with him were wholly in the wrong
eng_Latn after several minutes' hard work, they broke apart.
eng_Latn next year 'll do.
eng_Latn in hunger and thirst, cold and heat,
eng_Latn you have seen enough of it.
eng_Latn you would have deserved well of your country,
eng_Latn poured out another glassful of brandy
eng_Latn his former pursuits no longer interested him
eng_Latn the world was swaddled in a thick white ground fog
eng_Latn It was in a book about pirates we read last week!
eng_Latn looked around the small apartment
eng_Latn growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
eng_Latn I'm like to look sharpish.
eng_Latn crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.
eng_Latn when I wasn't around
eng_Latn I was so unprepared.
eng_Latn from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was general.
eng_Latn then he turned to me, scolding and questioning me.
eng_Latn afterwards she did not understand how it was that she did not do so.
eng_Latn Yip Is THIS your card Dog?
eng_Latn because he didn't ask me for any more details.
eng_Latn offered to give him typing lessons at home.
eng_Latn sometimes to put a suffering beast out of its misery, sometimes to fell a boar or a dingo.
eng_Latn you all would stick around for a while and he would have a chance to get to know her.
eng_Latn my mother liked her very much.
eng_Latn hes out of his pain.
eng_Latn falling clear upon the dark silence.
eng_Latn that perhaps he was right.
eng_Latn he should have a run of luck
eng_Latn But then nor will you, Pug. Perhapswe have a book in the shop that might tell you what to do.
eng_Latn I smell an adventure! Come on...
eng_Latn I didn't even know there was a reason to make you feel better until you started being all miserable.
eng_Latn I met her somewhere last night.
eng_Latn had no thought of trouble to come after the funeral.
eng_Latn I shall be about to have been studying it.
eng_Latn WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread
eng_Latn that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given her.
eng_Latn Now run middle!
eng_Latn each turned his attention to the weapon he would be using on the night of the strike.
eng_Latn I have some information you should know about.
eng_Latn he said softly and went back indoors.
eng_Latn she still didn't put pen to paper.
eng_Latn came running at the carriage
eng_Latn Is THIS your card? Is THIS your card? Is THIS your card?
eng_Latn her mouth tightened like an overwound spring.
eng_Latn I'd merely been making a pretext to come into the shop.
eng_Latn ask her for the sable cloak.
eng_Latn but it is childish to run into danger for nothing.
eng_Latn Two-Beards The Pirate!
eng_Latn I wished we'd gone hunting somewhere else.
eng_Latn your wife won't allow it!
eng_Latn but he stopped them with a gesture.
eng_Latn if it was me
eng_Latn I didn't mean to worry you.
eng_Latn not having to cook.
eng_Latn It's good to be myself again.
eng_Latn let's go drink a bottle of old wine together.
eng_Latn his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing
eng_Latn when in reality he had accomplished no more than the physical act
eng_Latn Wow-Bowzer! If I take that rock and roll it down the cave we can hear how deep it goes.
eng_Latn he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately!
eng_Latn the brink of my transformation from mortal to immortal.
eng_Latn a sweet little sister for you to play with
eng_Latn you don't seem to care much.
eng_Latn I'd not be buying the halfinterest.
eng_Latn whereupon the studio manager said
eng_Latn My feet are feeling dizzy Dog!
eng_Latn she concluded, laying her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven.
eng_Latn it is only that the catalogue is tedious
eng_Latn this week I've been, as it were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn't like it.
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug.
eng_Latn what a happy day we've had altogether.
eng_Latn if it had not been for the chart on the companion
eng_Latn so that none of them could miss a word
eng_Latn for where there is smoke, must be fire.
eng_Latn at last she was free.
eng_Latn I'm sure of it.
eng_Latn he was a university man, and had been a professor of philosophy
eng_Latn your sister thinks so as well as I.
eng_Latn I felt his soul depart.
eng_Latn there was that little pucker between her eyes again.
eng_Latn or we will kill you and your gods!
eng_Latn when she was young and free in her own house, mistress of her own body.
eng_Latn they were as likely to be disappointed as any of the relations whom he kept at a distance.
eng_Latn I have told you my wish
eng_Latn I had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts.
eng_Latn on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill.
eng_Latn then held it on his knee
eng_Latn laying a brawny hand upon his chest
eng_Latn well, anyway, with restaurantsand everything, say summers between eight and fifteen thousand a day.
eng_Latn all cooked and eaten that very evening.
eng_Latn made no sense whatsoever.
eng_Latn he went back to open his office under the protection of the soldiers.
eng_Latn I never said I was
eng_Latn as for the men
eng_Latn I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared.
eng_Latn I hope to do mine.
eng_Latn had the same artificial appearance as the hair on the saints.
eng_Latn she turned just in time
eng_Latn gazed about wondering at the wealth
eng_Latn for though they brought him fame
eng_Latn gave her an excellent opportunity of displaying the elegance of her figure.
eng_Latn And there will always be another, as sure as the moon becomes the sun becomes the moon, and light and night change places.
eng_Latn I dont care.
eng_Latn I'll tell you a family secret, she whispered enthusiastically.
eng_Latn still lingered about the same spot.
eng_Latn I was comforted.
eng_Latn here is a letter for one of thy officers, if I mistake not.
eng_Latn but her eyes were fine
eng_Latn he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing
eng_Latn Backwards.
eng_Latn he had not admitted that a star could coin itself into louis d'or.
eng_Latn she wouldn't hear a word.
eng_Latn And so Two-Beards the pirate and No-Beards the pirate rowed and rowed together.
eng_Latn I'm no labor agitator!
eng_Latn one here and one there
eng_Latn I want to do it too!
eng_Latn now, my dear, we have the duel.
eng_Latn to try if it came up to my own opinion of it
eng_Latn her small feet turning under her
eng_Latn although her appetite was excellent.
eng_Latn but if I can serve you in any way I shall be delighted
eng_Latn but it turns out that I was right.
eng_Latn I'm going through the dooryard after dinner.
eng_Latn I was way past being able to respond.
eng_Latn either fall down some hidden staircase
eng_Latn until the ridged vinyl started to hurt my forehead.
eng_Latn Puff.
eng_Latn but, no more was done.
eng_Latn AtEcouen, in order to take rank in the procession of
eng_Latn I think everyone enjoyed themselves good and hearty, and that's the main thing
eng_Latn the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself
eng_Latn I'm frightfully busy.
eng_Latn during which his face became pale
eng_Latn Pug, dogs don t really wear socks.Why do you have so many?
eng_Latn your sister thinks so as well as I.
eng_Latn he bent down and picked up a flat stone by a rock.
eng_Latn not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.
eng_Latn let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people!
eng_Latn The World of the Weird!
eng_Latn I didn't realize someone was holding my hand until whoever it was squeezed it lightly.
eng_Latn then it's not for any darky to talk impudent about him.
eng_Latn come here, let us talk and get acquainted.
eng_Latn Here it is. It's falling apart. Youmust have loved it once.
eng_Latn I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father
eng_Latn the lie lurks beneath it.
eng_Latn she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof.
eng_Latn I'll take care of you.
eng_Latn I assure you she did.
eng_Latn for they have no word in their language to express lying or falsehood.
eng_Latn for she hasn't the sense of a guinea hen.
eng_Latn but the news was good
eng_Latn I hated the feeling of having no choice.
eng_Latn not this time singing
eng_Latn then he too left.
eng_Latn I think you should look for Heffalumps and Woozles next!
eng_Latn I could not have killed her by the same blow
eng_Latn as little of him as possible not be introduced at all.
eng_Latn but at the same time there was a gleam of something like madness.
eng_Latn I'm half asleep already.
eng_Latn the boy, off he went.
eng_Latn for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand.
eng_Latn I guess I see what you mean, though.
eng_Latn but really I did not expect you.
eng_Latn if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.
eng_Latn Are you still here Dog?
eng_Latn I see him from time to time.
eng_Latn I know you didn't mean to but you DID do it.
eng_Latn he was sure that the devil had come.
eng_Latn I as brought him up porochially
eng_Latn he was beside her.
eng_Latn Helping people is what I do!
eng_Latn my mind is too fond of wandering on its own way.
eng_Latn he accompanied me in the office of watchdog
eng_Latn I furnished myself with a light
eng_Latn since everything that could possibly be done toaid him was already being done.
eng_Latn I forgot it and left it there.
eng_Latn I mean not having anything to do with any of the girls.
eng_Latn because there was a ridiculous curate in the next parish.
eng_Latn I don't want to hear it
eng_Latn I was but am now back again
eng_Latn I can look forward to no better happiness than that which would be one with yours.
eng_Latn Is something the matter?
eng_Latn I think I know who that one's from
eng_Latn the two made their way to thegeneral mission room below
eng_Latn there is an end of our investigation.
eng_Latn put the cup down empty.
eng_Latn putting the light near his face
eng_Latn I should never like to return to it.
eng_Latn which he had never looked before.
eng_Latn you would not like me to risk taking cold?
eng_Latn but I won't have you do this sort of thing.
eng_Latn he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears.
eng_Latn he was much surprised.
eng_Latn west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe so I decided to go east and learn the bond business.
eng_Latn This game is very realistic.
eng_Latn made it fast
eng_Latn then she looked at him
eng_Latn but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike
eng_Latn I think not sire
eng_Latn but how about me?
eng_Latn until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market place of the market town.
eng_Latn to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast,
eng_Latn that'll be tricky, too
eng_Latn I haven't got any money
eng_Latn the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself
eng_Latn I am glad you are here with me.
eng_Latn because it was not the scent of flowers or of artificial essences
eng_Latn he had not moved.
eng_Latn for I'll take my davy I should be rated
eng_Latn I think you'll do best to keep your visions to yourself
eng_Latn Granny loves cold pizza. She s funny that way.
eng_Latn but the carrier said he was only troubled with a cough.
eng_Latn who intends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.
eng_Latn breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory
eng_Latn many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.
eng_Latn for he was become wise in the way of clubs.
eng_Latn for merely inquiring if she had brought the money
eng_Latn a puff of wind was enough to lay it low.
eng_Latn taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
eng_Latn a doublebarreled shotgun clutched in both hands.
eng_Latn burying him in dark, damp compost
eng_Latn much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin.
eng_Latn tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother.
eng_Latn so many great princes and captains were assembled.
eng_Latn she had little eyes, sparkling like beads, and an effusive manner.
eng_Latn I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.
eng_Latn for it was at my house
eng_Latn I appreciate your coming.
eng_Latn though he had been informed, to begin with, that she had already gone to bed.
eng_Latn a spoonful once in four and twenty hours.
eng_Latn or the darling has lived with me
eng_Latn she memorized what he had said
eng_Latn you know, I'm not your boss.
eng_Latn I shall take the candle.
eng_Latn she acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look.
eng_Latn by the venture canst afford me so much satisfaction
eng_Latn I don't want to talk about it.
eng_Latn This is a book by...
eng_Latn tried the point upon his hand
eng_Latn - even in lighthouses!
eng_Latn I'd have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere.
eng_Latn when he should again interrogate her
eng_Latn so that cheapened the distinction too much.
eng_Latn they would secure me by force.
eng_Latn what was little less uncomfortable
eng_Latn as one was grateful for the sunshine and the rain.
eng_Latn as you are a gentleman, burn this letter
eng_Latn he began to think again about what she had feared.
eng_Latn give me all your attention for a minute or two.
eng_Latn but not for long
eng_Latn I waited a month
eng_Latn in order to discover the privileges of simplicity almost forty years late.
eng_Latn anyone beating him at anything
eng_Latn we have neglected many things.
eng_Latn There you are!
eng_Latn she saw a man coming along the hall.
eng_Latn until the ridged vinyl started to hurt my forehead.
eng_Latn their emotion was an irresistible riptide that caught them both up and swept them away in a glorious explosion, an eruption, and a contentment beyond words.
eng_Latn I almost scream.
eng_Latn she may be constant.
eng_Latn his voice promised that he would take care of her
eng_Latn he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
eng_Latn though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.
eng_Latn for I am getting rusty here.
eng_Latn went for a turn in his garden.
eng_Latn the night about three hours spent
eng_Latn when in reality he had accomplished no more than the physical act
eng_Latn although she had never had the heart to say any thing about
eng_Latn something that was too impenetrable for ultrasounds, too tough for needles.
eng_Latn but there were a dozen different accounts of how he had achieved his vast fortune, some of them not flattering.
eng_Latn I will put you to the proof, and this very moment.
eng_Latn laid the watch in the palm.
eng_Latn I too am a man like the rest of you.
eng_Latn I want to hold him and tell him how much I love him.
eng_Latn he had to hoist up his robes
eng_Latn he had to hoist up his robes
eng_Latn but was still extremely nervous
eng_Latn then, without waiting for an answer
eng_Latn so very dry, as you say.
eng_Latn who was apparently on his deathbed
eng_Latn he laid his finger on his lip
eng_Latn I say, stop there.
eng_Latn I pulled my wallet from my jeans pocket
eng_Latn I hired a horse and guide for five shillings
eng_Latn threw over his crutch
eng_Latn suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face.
eng_Latn though it's a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that.
eng_Latn had already stopped flowing out of his right ear.
eng_Latn when everyone else said you were just a heartless coquette.
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder Dog?
eng_Latn I had been hoping to live the rest of my life out of the sound of those things.
eng_Latn the pads of his palms bulged
eng_Latn I did not come this way, ' I said.
eng_Latn I should never like to return to it.
eng_Latn as she fell a broken branch struck a blow near the eye.
eng_Latn a cup not so big as a nut shell
eng_Latn kissing the count's hand
eng_Latn for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching
eng_Latn their eyes followed the hand that held the sandwich.
eng_Latn I went for it, cautious and slow.
eng_Latn I looked back at the bed I had left.
eng_Latn us standing off and on in the old WALRUS.
eng_Latn blue is an inquiry for information about a suspect
eng_Latn but let us walk
eng_Latn except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.
eng_Latn then I ran from her, down the long narrow passage to my own room,tripping, stumbling over the flounces of my dress.
eng_Latn so different from the man he used to be.
eng_Latn I'm going to get him back.
eng_Latn I left my new rod and the rest of the fishing tackle in my bedroom.
eng_Latn he had felt a stirring of tenderness.
eng_Latn MNoirtier looked after the servant until the door was closed
eng_Latn I returned home
eng_Latn How much longer, Mr Piccalilli?
eng_Latn expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him.
eng_Latn I'm going to have to try to wash it out.
eng_Latn all eyes were fixed on the door
eng_Latn as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy's attack very long.
eng_Latn when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas
eng_Latn the house had burned down
eng_Latn he flirted with a few of them at the balls.
eng_Latn which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals.
eng_Latn all convinced me that I was the same then and there that I am this moment.
eng_Latn something kind of moved inside me.
eng_Latn not a pickle eater.
eng_Latn but sat severely silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
eng_Latn I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily
eng_Latn did just that, divorced her.
eng_Latn I danced there one evening.
eng_Latn again that neglected and thin spinster and her equally thin anddistrait looking mother.
eng_Latn it was not such a hollow world at all.
eng_Latn then he turned to me, scolding and questioning me.
eng_Latn to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child's chair as the chair would hold
eng_Latn cried the young girl
eng_Latn most of it grief and pain and hunger.
eng_Latn at the foot of the scaffold
eng_Latn a few more seconds went by.
eng_Latn if I am victorious
eng_Latn he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg.
eng_Latn Uh What happened?
eng_Latn she saw many young men who attracted her.
eng_Latn in such cases the complete revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity.
eng_Latn that you may see how rational I am grown.
eng_Latn he looked down once more, and his desire to throw himself down was gone.
eng_Latn I frowned at my homework.
eng_Latn her head covered
eng_Latn I stepped over the great western gate.
eng_Latn he had tried
eng_Latn I missed my mother terribly.
eng_Latn to repair his farm implements
eng_Latn I gave her another truth and another analogy.
eng_Latn of our humanity
eng_Latn It appears I'm being chased throughthe pages of my own book.
eng_Latn sinking to his knees in the muddy field
eng_Latn but not once of the impending danger.
eng_Latn kicked him over onto his back, so that his face was visible.
eng_Latn since I have you to help me.
eng_Latn he and his son arrived next day.
eng_Latn I felt there was something between us.
eng_Latn the doors of heaven opened to her.
eng_Latn went off to guard the river bank
eng_Latn his heart beat so violently
eng_Latn still less to make the thread clear for the careless and the scoffing.
eng_Latn refreshed and renewed, at the unusual hour of eleven o' clock
eng_Latn stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase
eng_Latn but I made little way with him.
eng_Latn so began a perambulation of the house
eng_Latn it was me that blowed on them!
eng_Latn Quite so. One moment it was there -the next - gone! We are not amused.
eng_Latn but when I did it I can't in the least remember.
eng_Latn he was cold.
eng_Latn they must not have had to ply their oars very hard.
eng_Latn she recovered from it slowly.
eng_Latn Oo.Oo.Oo. Can we come too?
eng_Latn but the appearance of both had been minutely described.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug?
eng_Latn so bent was he by the wound in his hip.
eng_Latn Me? You re the one who let go!
eng_Latn content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre
eng_Latn a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.
eng_Latn now he had lost his fear.
eng_Latn next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave
eng_Latn shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
eng_Latn to invent an easy justification for his surrender.
eng_Latn how you must miss her!
eng_Latn I just'let her carry on a bit.
eng_Latn but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were not yet dressed.
eng_Latn where he had me trapped
eng_Latn I will need feeding in the night.
eng_Latn but the stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal flight, with added fleetness.
eng_Latn These dog biscuits taste of chasing cats!
eng_Latn she's well she does not want any more attendance from you!
eng_Latn but I didn't try to seduceher at first or at any time, really.
eng_Latn but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it.
eng_Latn Hello. I'm Doris the donkey.
eng_Latn but then it made another rush forward.
eng_Latn don't say good bye
eng_Latn Well pointed again Pug!
eng_Latn he repeated with gloomy insistence.
eng_Latn but in time she began to idealize her father.
eng_Latn biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away
eng_Latn he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment.
eng_Latn I smiled at the enthusiasm in his voice.
eng_Latn if I do not knock them head over heels
eng_Latn crying in a hoarse sort of screech
eng_Latn Dog I think I know it! Abracadabra!
eng_Latn he saw two long tails of yellow hair
eng_Latn her melancholy was just like the august melancholy
eng_Latn but the short flick of yellowish flame in the dusk was powerless against the muffled up mysteriousness of the dark figure with an invisible face concealed by a great sombrero.
eng_Latn if I cared to settle two or three thousand on him for life he would never worry me again.
eng_Latn if it was me
eng_Latn when I woke up
eng_Latn she knitted her brow
eng_Latn Is there a map of this pyramid in your book Granny Pug?
eng_Latn I have told you my wish
eng_Latn partly because he liked it best
eng_Latn I recognized him at glance.
eng_Latn I don't like that way of doing things.
eng_Latn she said when they were ready
eng_Latn nothing ever will happen.
eng_Latn that although five o'clock came and then six
eng_Latn I do think it would be better to wait, said the latter.
eng_Latn I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank
eng_Latn would so like to meet you.
eng_Latn got my head into his mouth.
eng_Latn but luck was hostile.
eng_Latn for the first time he was not irritated by her eyes meeting his.
eng_Latn who could call forth her sensibility
eng_Latn I must say this comes as something of a surprise.
eng_Latn opened a drawer
eng_Latn especially if one's friends were invariably fit for any function they desired to undertake!
eng_Latn she ran for safety to her own room, and, locking herself in
eng_Latn I am needed.
eng_Latn they were all seated and busy
eng_Latn as though he were keeping something to himself.
eng_Latn I mean, I guess that's what it's like
eng_Latn I don't know what that means
eng_Latn then the keeper touched him on the arm, and he turned and went back to breaking stone.
eng_Latn I liked the way he looked at me as he listened.
eng_Latn more than anything else, it troubled and irritated him.
eng_Latn which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit.
eng_Latn she was reminded of night calls to death and calamity
eng_Latn with a square cupola, very retired among some trees and a lawn
eng_Latn I have no doubt she did.
eng_Latn so that to bring him round again, ever so little, cost me more than six hundred eggs
eng_Latn the first is that I have made your acquaintance
eng_Latn I was and shut the door behind me.
eng_Latn he did not appear to be very ready with suggestions available ones.
eng_Latn I put back the receiver.
eng_Latn now I die
eng_Latn I'll have to see first, you know.
eng_Latn sinking to his knees in the muddy field
eng_Latn she had begun then to lose some of her illusions about her hero.
eng_Latn his feet refused to obey him
eng_Latn but impaled his wife on a pitchfork
eng_Latn rip open that bed, and search the straw.
eng_Latn It's a game Dog!
eng_Latn for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.
eng_Latn but at last we were allowed to bury her.
eng_Latn This is a book about an inventor in the future and it is called...
eng_Latn as if some one had thrown a light missile at him.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know... the oldest working lighthouse in the world was built two thousand years ago?
eng_Latn I never did see such a girl as you.
eng_Latn you've no need to be.
eng_Latn trying to smother his relief.
eng_Latn it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine shop, shattered like a walnut shell.
eng_Latn Welcome fellow explorers. We are about to go on a journey back in time!
eng_Latn they haven't any feeling of poetryand beauty.
eng_Latn I will tell you everything when I see you.
eng_Latn I could not find one.
eng_Latn acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants.
eng_Latn but I discovered that secret to my master upon an accident which happened about a fortnight before.
eng_Latn I just love your roses
eng_Latn it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.
eng_Latn on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence
eng_Latn the postmaster turned his horse into the yard
eng_Latn wiped the dust off with the sleeve of her shirt.
eng_Latn pictures of her late husband and daughter.
eng_Latn I knew how he felt.
eng_Latn I'm sure I saw her wearing it the other night.
eng_Latn but I didn't think.
eng_Latn Not if you don t do anything wrongin her magic contest .
eng_Latn I had already explained the meaning of the word
eng_Latn I can answer for its being so on his.
eng_Latn do not keep me waiting
eng_Latn And we have a book about them?
eng_Latn with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment
eng_Latn if you oppose me in this great stake
eng_Latn I'm solonely and I need somebody to cheer me up.
eng_Latn the minute it is discovered.
eng_Latn at the risk of being stifled
eng_Latn I have never interfered in your
eng_Latn but no sound disturbed the quiet.
eng_Latn ...and we still remember their names.
eng_Latn I should think shed be ashamed of herself if she has.
eng_Latn quite pleased apparently.
eng_Latn the priest drew in an immense quantity of snuff out of the hollow of his palm.
eng_Latn meticulously and very properly.
eng_Latn I'm even weady to dance the pas de chale.
eng_Latn she does so want to see you.
eng_Latn fumbling about him for his cane
eng_Latn that hung on her forehead
eng_Latn just like you said!
eng_Latn he slipped quietly down
eng_Latn I felt his surprise and sudden worry.
eng_Latn began another laugh.
eng_Latn I hain't been gone anywheres.
eng_Latn in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates.
eng_Latn pretty near the cook
eng_Latn I followed him in
eng_Latn I am very responsible and have never had my tongue in your daughter's mouth.
eng_Latn this fan awakened a recollection
eng_Latn I know we're going to getalong.
eng_Latn they never knew how she laughed at them behind their backs, jeered at them, mimicked them.
eng_Latn But oh I'm running low on blue paint.I must have more blue. It's my favourite colour.
eng_Latn I hesitated to throw my mind frivolously away.
eng_Latn make this man to recover
eng_Latn I did not ask him anything more.
eng_Latn so as to throw no blame on any one.
eng_Latn his absence was a relief to me.
eng_Latn That looks very old.
eng_Latn of a sudden, I began to comprehend.
eng_Latn his only acquaintances were spiders and a tree that grew outside his grating
eng_Latn but, repenting half way, I returned softly, and lo!
eng_Latn I thought books had ALL the answers, Granny Pug.
eng_Latn that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me
eng_Latn it's very bad form for husband and wife to love each other.
eng_Latn And I have just the thing Dog.
eng_Latn as she cocked her head and listened.
eng_Latn he finished, smiling more broadly than ever.
eng_Latn adieu, my friend adieu, my father!
eng_Latn it was a deep sense of heat that had come out of his own deep and mortal time
eng_Latn was that which the angels announced on the night that was our day
eng_Latn of whose dignity he was not aware
eng_Latn there was no excuse or reason
eng_Latn now it's done.
eng_Latn I'm sure I'm not sorry he's dead.
eng_Latn THERE never was such an overturn in this world.
eng_Latn unhorse you with a split helmet every time.
eng_Latn No!
eng_Latn Missing items... pygmy pythons...Aah.Enid Brighton!
eng_Latn a greasy smudge crossed his white brow.
eng_Latn would certainly have been a most astonishing object
eng_Latn that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way
eng_Latn I know it's a short notice job
eng_Latn but relatively of such was their nature.
eng_Latn crossed the palisade on the north side
eng_Latn very conscious of your exclusiveness.
eng_Latn maybe he was a bit of a mothers boy.
eng_Latn his eyes fixed on the house.
eng_Latn I owed my life to you
eng_Latn I read this really good book recently
eng_Latn how I was going to have this baby
eng_Latn but without taking off her clothes.
eng_Latn this indomitable egotism charged her cheeks with colour
eng_Latn Will there ever be a time I don tlearn anything new?
eng_Latn who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to
eng_Latn when he heard it yet again.
eng_Latn but fate had given him no choice.
eng_Latn she said, trying once again
eng_Latn he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
eng_Latn I can't tell you.
eng_Latn who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box
eng_Latn I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again.
eng_Latn side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning.
eng_Latn so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly,
eng_Latn I know I love you.
eng_Latn I shall never be a man of renown.
eng_Latn Gemini...
eng_Latn but I decided that was nonsense.
eng_Latn This book doesn t have many pictures Dog.
eng_Latn How curious. But we are here to solve a mystery.
eng_Latn And you re not upset?
eng_Latn blind of one eye and not very sound in the other.
eng_Latn the prisoner was brought in
eng_Latn poured all the gold into his palm
eng_Latn but which was powerful and troubling.
eng_Latn it cut deeper than ever, this time.
eng_Latn when it was too late.
eng_Latn was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so.
eng_Latn Phew Hooray! Hooray! It's a happy Dino day!
eng_Latn on the contrary
eng_Latn there is something that would tell me how to point him out.
eng_Latn we are such old playfellows.
eng_Latn shut yourself up again.
eng_Latn Snark-snarky-snarky-snark. Snark- snarky-snarky-snark!
eng_Latn or I hope you will come to me.
eng_Latn but, if you will persist
eng_Latn Why am I Dog and not Pug?
eng_Latn but sheforgot which hand was which
eng_Latn to be able to solve so delicate a question
eng_Latn took out his wand to magically lock it.
eng_Latn leaving him fastened in such a way that it was impossible for him to release himself.
eng_Latn Dog! I heard someone shouting, so I popped into the next nursery rhyme and rescued Little Miss Muffet!
eng_Latn began another laugh.
eng_Latn he showed his submission
eng_Latn I didn't realize someone was holding my hand until whoever it was squeezed it lightly.
eng_Latn I'm very disappointed in you.
eng_Latn I heard him say so.
eng_Latn I don't think he could
eng_Latn the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.
eng_Latn then he paused
eng_Latn I'll have to see first, you know.
eng_Latn if you won't obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time!
eng_Latn nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own consent.
eng_Latn not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted.
eng_Latn I didn't much care for it.
eng_Latn wherever you go
eng_Latn I thought all this very pretty and engaging
eng_Latn a third says the liberation of the galley slaves is the best of all
eng_Latn she thanked them all for having entertained her so well.
eng_Latn You won t catch me, if I don t want to be caught!
eng_Latn I'm going to have to try to wash it out.
eng_Latn that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled
eng_Latn you're going out to dinner with a multimillionaire.
eng_Latn he tightened his grasp upon my hand
eng_Latn to my great joy
eng_Latn had placed her shoe on the hearth stone also.
eng_Latn Pug, we are needed. Come on!
eng_Latn keep the weather of the island.
eng_Latn I have a few points to make.
eng_Latn so began a perambulation of the house
eng_Latn never pushed his own button which would have brought the nurse running.
eng_Latn she held the right foot in her hand and felt the five small toes
eng_Latn I felt a little bit heavy hearted about the gang
eng_Latn so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong.
eng_Latn the cousin staggered
eng_Latn with his tongue poking out
eng_Latn I saw you had one knight errant already.
eng_Latn Woowow Now!
eng_Latn I have seen a man for the first time in my life.
eng_Latn I get exhausted just watching her
eng_Latn I just looked straight ahead.
eng_Latn sometimes there's an inch of silver six words in the bottom of the net.
eng_Latn did I ever get so angry as over his words.
eng_Latn I wonder if we have a book that would tell us what to do when we see a thing like that.
eng_Latn Act one - a marvellous convenient place for a rehearsal.
eng_Latn begged to ask him a few questions.
eng_Latn but, if you will persist
eng_Latn I bent down to go in, like a goose under a gate
eng_Latn I hardly liked to ask to go by.
eng_Latn she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw, of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers.
eng_Latn I try to smile, but my face won't quite do it.
eng_Latn they did not seem to belong to the same species
eng_Latn I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully.
eng_Latn meeting with any interruption by the way.
eng_Latn with the help of spectacles.
eng_Latn but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered.
eng_Latn Dog is very doggy and that isn t amask!
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! I ll shoot it up to themoon in a rocket! They ll never get their paws on it there.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! I know how we can find our friends. Blow Watson. Blow!
eng_Latn it cut deeper than ever, this time.
eng_Latn a montera of the same velvet.
eng_Latn very few people were at the funeral
eng_Latn That...?
eng_Latn but the warm, chlorinated taste of the water made his stomach turn.
eng_Latn but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!
eng_Latn they had guessed everything of any importance about each other in two seconds at the utmost
eng_Latn I wouldn't be in his house
eng_Latn as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen, or was falling.
eng_Latn yet two had been base born and one had deserted her
eng_Latn Future Cities... The World Today...Things A Very Long Time Ago.
eng_Latn pausing for just a moment to let the light spill into the boy's room
eng_Latn I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet
eng_Latn you see, it would be your own business.
eng_Latn I must say this comes as something of a surprise.
eng_Latn We need to think of an idea ourselves.
eng_Latn whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?
eng_Latn it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the conditionof man.
eng_Latn I was just old enough to know that it's good to be alone occasionally.
eng_Latn decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death.
eng_Latn as we ourselves might have done
eng_Latn but the storm had been so violent
eng_Latn I have always thought her pretty
eng_Latn And if you know where North is youcan find your way home.
eng_Latn she had gauged her quarry well, the gross old spider.
eng_Latn I'm yours for ever
eng_Latn I'll talk to you as long as you like
eng_Latn for all is lost now!
eng_Latn No, no, no, NO!
eng_Latn six of us
eng_Latn with many more.
eng_Latn I think not sire
eng_Latn he would have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always observed towards her
eng_Latn she stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path.
eng_Latn I say pass me another fritter please.
eng_Latn I ought to know who I am
eng_Latn though there seemed no chance
eng_Latn to contradict this statement
eng_Latn will render unnecessary the aid of the police
eng_Latn reflected that he might have a cold.
eng_Latn as doubtless she would
eng_Latn but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind.
eng_Latn permit me to marry her!
eng_Latn turned and went due east again.
eng_Latn getting off the bed.
eng_Latn but all they knew was
eng_Latn so brightly polished that, matching as they did the rest of his apparel
eng_Latn I stare at her dazedly.
eng_Latn I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.
eng_Latn Then I heard a mysterious voice.
eng_Latn asked me the object of my visit.
eng_Latn some in their own happiness
eng_Latn not set down at random the first thing that comes into his head.
eng_Latn when the occasionpresents itself, we tell the truth about it.
eng_Latn travelling downwards into that dark region without any certainty or knowledge of where I was going, so I resolved to enter it and rest myself for a while.
eng_Latn asked when he was leaving.
eng_Latn I am sure it was not his fault.
eng_Latn but never will I lean on a staff again.
eng_Latn but the news was good
eng_Latn might quit its abode whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed
eng_Latn astonished perhaps at our preparedness.
eng_Latn so you are a baron now.
eng_Latn why we'll fight the ship.
eng_Latn loaded with heavy dark tables.
eng_Latn I am needed.
eng_Latn the diver has seen it.
eng_Latn she received an evasive answer.
eng_Latn he laid his finger on his lip
eng_Latn he trailed himself across the deck.
eng_Latn I seen it all shut up and dusty
eng_Latn in broken sentences, and with many drawings of breath.
eng_Latn Woogh. I wish I didn t have to do this job. Stuck down there in the dark, waiting to pop out and warn people off.
eng_Latn now you have my profession of faith.
eng_Latn hastened to the room where he had locked her in.
eng_Latn he said you'd resigned.
eng_Latn but when I did it I can't in the least remember.
eng_Latn between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going
eng_Latn I was thirty.
eng_Latn but she did not dare to speak of it.
eng_Latn he must be a great criminal
eng_Latn but on every other point his wits were as sound as mine.
eng_Latn as though it were heavy.
eng_Latn THIS is virtual reality.
eng_Latn all armed themselves with stones and formed in line
eng_Latn I danced there one evening.
eng_Latn I read this really good book recently
eng_Latn in such cases the complete revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity.
eng_Latn my faults were not confirmed in me.
eng_Latn I'll send the money by credit transfer.
eng_Latn or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people
eng_Latn she understood that her fate was sealed.
eng_Latn Pug, I am very sorry. I was so keento have an exciting adventure today I made you have four!
eng_Latn but his eyes were distant and unfocused
eng_Latn his arthritis no worse but certainly no better, and at just past eleven he had stopped at a small cafe for lunch.
eng_Latn I promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.
eng_Latn on the night that followed that famous day
eng_Latn I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet
eng_Latn he wanted to kill me
eng_Latn Ready, Pug!
eng_Latn he said softly and went back indoors.
eng_Latn resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer.
eng_Latn loaded with heavy dark tables.
eng_Latn he repeated from the steps.
eng_Latn a tall well fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back.
eng_Latn Perhaps we could help you?
eng_Latn nay, must even thank him.
eng_Latn I'm not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them.
eng_Latn she would not have to take it off even to sleep.
eng_Latn I've got some copy for you to run downstairs.
eng_Latn it is my plan to see him personally as well as to have some other people
eng_Latn what was worse, serious diseases with the symptoms of minor ones.
eng_Latn I miss my truck, I whimpered to myself.
eng_Latn I must say this comes as something of a surprise.
eng_Latn but it seems to me these guys don't get to the top without trampling over a few people on the way.
eng_Latn I am left none the worse of it
eng_Latn that he'd meant it literally when he'd spoken of the prom, that he was staking a claim.
eng_Latn one not to be bothered with at this time.
eng_Latn put your hearts in it!
eng_Latn but a swearing good man something like me only there's a good deal more of him.
eng_Latn I would delay not to say a day, but four, for the sake of seeing it.
eng_Latn but if you can't keep up your end, we will stand our loss, of course,
eng_Latn dearer to me than any blood sister could ever be.
eng_Latn how you must miss her!
eng_Latn I lay a quarter of an hour listening and trembling.
eng_Latn except that she didnt want me.
eng_Latn for to such a man it does not matter whether he says one thing more than another.
eng_Latn who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed.
eng_Latn he recognized the boat at once.
eng_Latn he's to be stwuck off the list tomowwow
eng_Latn we kissed one another over and over again
eng_Latn having learnt the art in my youth.
eng_Latn certainly not from his mother or from me.
eng_Latn You could always take the lift.
eng_Latn writes the warden's letters and stuff like that.
eng_Latn Fish... fish... fish... fish...You!
eng_Latn after an hour or two he reentered, when the room was clear, in no degree calmer
eng_Latn upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles
eng_Latn his voice echoing in the dark passage.
eng_Latn the only emotion she could not bear.
eng_Latn I completely messed up
eng_Latn all re entered the house.
eng_Latn I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet bag, tucked it under my arm
eng_Latn with a square cupola, very retired among some trees and a lawn
eng_Latn who sympathized but little in the event
eng_Latn in fairly good training
eng_Latn for he knew that the authorities were wrong.
eng_Latn who intends for some time, at least, to retire from the world.
eng_Latn now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast.
eng_Latn because your system was already impregnated with it.
eng_Latn for there were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him
eng_Latn I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad.
eng_Latn And never wanted to wear a captain s hat again.
eng_Latn besides a diligent search into my pockets
eng_Latn Hmpf.
eng_Latn clutching at the stone wall
eng_Latn that's on the edge of the grave.
eng_Latn awaited his directions.
eng_Latn a montera of the same velvet.
eng_Latn How curious... A daisy.
eng_Latn but, perceiving his error
eng_Latn kick of a horse crushed his chest and a crowd of outsiders saw him die in the middle of the street
eng_Latn but in time she began to idealize her father.
eng_Latn the general has been killed
eng_Latn I offered her the key.
eng_Latn but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days
eng_Latn Poor me.
eng_Latn I gave her a small car for her birthday.
eng_Latn Drawing books are for drawing.
eng_Latn a silent presence near my bed
eng_Latn if it was me
eng_Latn I had the intelligence from her father yesterday.
eng_Latn what a wonderful man he is!
eng_Latn we lack the courage to step from our accustomed role
eng_Latn because he didn't ask me for any more details.
eng_Latn you are beating on my brain
eng_Latn That s what I was thinking, but indifferent words.
eng_Latn We re here to help you with your high jump.
eng_Latn reached for the sugar bowl
eng_Latn with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.
eng_Latn who had escaped from the local jail earlier that night and were hiding in the chapel.
eng_Latn your gesture, your movement
eng_Latn BOW WOWZER!!!
eng_Latn that was what had wakened her.
eng_Latn waiting to be asked to dance when she was asked for a waltz
eng_Latn so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures.
eng_Latn the president offered him the side of the railing
eng_Latn coming out of the earth
eng_Latn I could only judge that
eng_Latn I told him everything about myself.
eng_Latn they will see him come back a horse boy.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat could help you persuade them to move?
eng_Latn thinking she would turn around and go back.
eng_Latn but suddenly composing himself, he fell on his knees
eng_Latn I really don't know why you bother.
eng_Latn for two days he had scarcely tasted food.
eng_Latn but there was something in his voice that surprised me.
eng_Latn that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation.
eng_Latn I do like it so very much.
eng_Latn the president offered him the side of the railing
eng_Latn I have a funny feeling I ve had a funny feeling like this before Dog
eng_Latn as she cocked her head and listened.
eng_Latn he broke out into a sweat.
eng_Latn we may be able to save her.
eng_Latn You look like a bloke who likes to help people.
eng_Latn Anyone for cricket? Go ahead,Janice, throw the ball!
eng_Latn It's a mystery!
eng_Latn as many pages as he had written since his farewell to her.
eng_Latn but held his tongue.
eng_Latn but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small needle.
eng_Latn he went out, closing the door after hiM
eng_Latn like a good brother, she answered demurely.
eng_Latn but swallowed the home thrust in silence.
eng_Latn I could never get much out of him except the fact
eng_Latn she ran to him.
eng_Latn look at yer mum!
eng_Latn I paused, giving my hunters a few minutes' head start.
eng_Latn making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife.
eng_Latn I do like it so very much.
eng_Latn saw himself reflected in them as two tiny manikins of insignificant proportion.
eng_Latn anyway, you've had too many close shaves already.
eng_Latn no more talking!
eng_Latn I was a fool not to expect something like this.
eng_Latn given to the society of thieves and scapegraces.
eng_Latn except I don't like any of the things that have been happening.
eng_Latn On the Island Of Dogs there wasone famous place.
eng_Latn but I was already out the door.
eng_Latn There s nothing here Dog.
eng_Latn I told you at the beginning of lunch you had a lovely and unusual name,
eng_Latn was a very great lady.
eng_Latn It's completely vanished!
eng_Latn I can do very little reading myself, but I have a friend he can.
eng_Latn I could not sleep.
eng_Latn but you have made my mouth water
eng_Latn the clerk, who was sitting by the vestry room fire
eng_Latn I have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way
eng_Latn how I saved his life
eng_Latn what it must be for a wife when she's never sure of her husband, when he hasn't got a principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by others than of getting his own toes pinched.
eng_Latn he had already gone to his business.
eng_Latn that old woman murdered in our district.
eng_Latn like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong.
eng_Latn then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money
eng_Latn I assure you I have.
eng_Latn because I'm too insignificant to conquer the world.
eng_Latn I was your equal at eighteen quite your equal.
eng_Latn unscrewed it, and turned it over.
eng_Latn so you just must come and take me away.
eng_Latn I'm telling him to come to dinner.
eng_Latn We ve become dried up mud monsters. And I have still got dust up my nose that Tina kicked up.
eng_Latn the consequence was that when their eyes met again
eng_Latn then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, someone spoke.
eng_Latn they walked on very lovingly together.
eng_Latn I dare not come again.
eng_Latn Really? That s very kind of you.
eng_Latn I must also return to the feast.
eng_Latn at night they locked their doors in fear and dread.
eng_Latn sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! Now you don t have to.(TO THE MICE) Were you offering to help Dog all along?
eng_Latn but the atmosphere between us isn't remotely awkward any more.
eng_Latn but he was distracted almost at once
eng_Latn I loved the final touch the scream for help.
eng_Latn I told him to take the cup with me
eng_Latn so brightly polished that, matching as they did the rest of his apparel
eng_Latn One pair left to find.
eng_Latn who attends my mother
eng_Latn I am sure she'll tell you I'm affectionate.
eng_Latn I wondered whether you'd be kind enough to advise me.
eng_Latn although still warm and sunny.
eng_Latn he wanted to kill me
eng_Latn I will find you!
eng_Latn with its head upon her breast.
eng_Latn I came straight to it, by instinct, I suppose.
eng_Latn like I'd done it a thousand times before
eng_Latn had arranged every detail
eng_Latn work my own way
eng_Latn I smiled wanly at the nervous man.
eng_Latn understood to do it so well
eng_Latn I asked you to get out.
eng_Latn I mean to go into all that.
eng_Latn she would not think about them
eng_Latn a little weather beaten to be sure but not much
eng_Latn resting lightly on his crutch
eng_Latn bashfully inquired whether whether he wouldn't take a cup of tea?
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn I asked as lightly as I could manage.
eng_Latn I had money ready again.
eng_Latn she had been recently stuffed.
eng_Latn I imagined it was some importunate person who
eng_Latn I won't need you to rescue me.
eng_Latn I do not think so.
eng_Latn so indeed it was
eng_Latn she turned just in time
eng_Latn but bear in mind if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles
eng_Latn if I sit still he will never see me.
eng_Latn that was the only concession she would make.
eng_Latn I will work harder.
eng_Latn but the other two didn't even look back.
eng_Latn OR the bookshop mice are back from their camping trip.
eng_Latn opened it, drew out three bank bills, which he laid on thetable.
eng_Latn would not go in to witness the battle between her champion and her opponent.
eng_Latn I might lose this battle and end up killing everyone in sight.
eng_Latn wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground.
eng_Latn But I keep getting you wrong.
eng_Latn but this is quite between ourselves.
eng_Latn Soggy doggy biscuits! We might aswell sleep until the sun comes up and things get interesting again.
eng_Latn a good little child,whose soul is now in heaven.
eng_Latn I ask you to come with me because I want you and your company
eng_Latn avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.
eng_Latn I needed to breathe so that I could play my role correctly.
eng_Latn placed his most valuable possessions in the strongbox
eng_Latn but when he reached it he found it was a road.
eng_Latn I need more than five.
eng_Latn with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might
eng_Latn the poor old man did die
eng_Latn Would you like to be in it too?
eng_Latn to make sure that he was unobserved
eng_Latn however, I escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree
eng_Latn I must leave you at ten o'clock.
eng_Latn without a certain amount of personal risk and without a great profusion in spending his money.
eng_Latn he headquarters she released the prisoners from the stocks.
eng_Latn the two at once left the house
eng_Latn And here we are Pug – the Outback.
eng_Latn something just bust in her.
eng_Latn I will remember it, said the young man
eng_Latn I back up to the bed.
eng_Latn should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon.
eng_Latn if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them
eng_Latn he began to snore.
eng_Latn I took a step forward.
eng_Latn the bolted door must have seemed suspicious
eng_Latn I don't want you to do anything
eng_Latn it cut deeper than ever, this time.
eng_Latn I just saw a robotic claw. Howuseful. But not quite as useful as thisjoystick. After you, Pug -
eng_Latn I old a pistol in my hand!
eng_Latn there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people
eng_Latn he has ordered me to take him
eng_Latn to talk about anything other than river navigation
eng_Latn he said in a tough voice.
eng_Latn but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.
eng_Latn who had screamed.
eng_Latn he had sprained his ankle when the spider had dropped him.
eng_Latn it belongs to him.
eng_Latn I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely.
eng_Latn I forgot everything but my own amazement.
eng_Latn I think we must have given up on finding Granny Pug...and ate the sandwiches ourselves.
eng_Latn you must look life in the face.
eng_Latn he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal.
eng_Latn then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns each worth about eighty francs of our money
eng_Latn I said I would inform them when our search was complete.
eng_Latn wrapped it in brown paper
eng_Latn he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military authorities
eng_Latn into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead.
eng_Latn I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale.
eng_Latn the lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business.
eng_Latn darted into her head, and cost her another blush.
eng_Latn but there was no reason
eng_Latn I will work harder.
eng_Latn that would make the boy violently sick.
eng_Latn I turned her gently over
eng_Latn unless you give me cause.
eng_Latn kissing the count's hand
eng_Latn though he perceived he was to come out of it wearied and vanquished.
eng_Latn I've run quite out of it.
eng_Latn assisted to hold him with one hand
eng_Latn just after I was born
eng_Latn his other hand in his jacket pocket for a shell.
eng_Latn HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
eng_Latn I shall never forget the evening I spent with him.
eng_Latn behave so as to show that she admitted any error in herself.
eng_Latn as we said
eng_Latn I know the last couple days must've been hard for you.
eng_Latn however, I escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree
eng_Latn Called The Thrilling Three tuck into their picnic.
eng_Latn sent him starting up from the bench.
eng_Latn any one to deny his origin
eng_Latn it had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries.
eng_Latn but it never entered my head that it was you,
eng_Latn the gray repeated the same word twice
eng_Latn My new palace puss-kins!
eng_Latn one apparently contained the two bazookas
eng_Latn I do remember.
eng_Latn to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world
eng_Latn feeling completely torn.
eng_Latn not a matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.
eng_Latn I know my hair is straight, but it isn't as straight as that.
eng_Latn don't interrupt me
eng_Latn show it was no mere irresponsible venture of his hand
eng_Latn for he was later than usual in returning that day.
eng_Latn that all the women should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned
eng_Latn we could live in the house.
eng_Latn locked her up in her bedroom.
eng_Latn I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.
eng_Latn didn't wake up.
eng_Latn Starts? Don t talk to us about starts! We ve been waiting to start our race for hours!
eng_Latn but was still extremely nervous
eng_Latn I'm going with them.
eng_Latn until he almost lay along the animal's spine
eng_Latn but without taking off her clothes.
eng_Latn perhaps, a lad to keep him company.
eng_Latn that she did not dare to decipher.
eng_Latn along with some of the teeth of the gang.
eng_Latn whereupon the young man already mentioned was accordingly introduced
eng_Latn then I felt that knife go in me
eng_Latn he would exclaim as he said this
eng_Latn they're so thin skinned and chicken hearted.
eng_Latn just like you said!
eng_Latn that in this world there is neither honor nor justice.
eng_Latn What a wonderful place Pug!
eng_Latn but immensely matter of fact.
eng_Latn the venom in your eyes will dissolve them in a few hours.
eng_Latn how you must miss her!
eng_Latn she wouldn't hear a word.
eng_Latn it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone.
eng_Latn shark is only one syllable.
eng_Latn I always wanted you to jine
eng_Latn but with the stubbornness of an old man made of stone
eng_Latn I look up blearily.
eng_Latn gave him the thumbs up.
eng_Latn Gadzooks! It's a dragon s egg!
eng_Latn Tea time everyone!
eng_Latn Or better yet a set of Yetis?
eng_Latn Dog loves Books!
eng_Latn or, in short, vanquish and subdue him
eng_Latn he had no need to be surrounded by beautiful things.
eng_Latn he came to me.
eng_Latn coming from the wing?
eng_Latn resuming her work
eng_Latn read it so that you may be heard
eng_Latn I never said I was
eng_Latn Sometimes I wish I could make those naughty bookshop mice disappear.
eng_Latn replied the man
eng_Latn And a paw. Tally-ho!
eng_Latn I wonder if I could come and see you?
eng_Latn But I AM afraid and now I have toask one to move somewhere else.
eng_Latn why, she is too old for such pettishness.
eng_Latn I hope it all went off tolerably well.
eng_Latn when I tried it.
eng_Latn I shall perish if you do not take me away.
eng_Latn now return to your own room.
eng_Latn I leaned my head against the jamb and listened.
eng_Latn I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on.
eng_Latn There is a word - a special word -for when a lot of snow lets go of a mountain and decides to run to the bottom. AVALANCHE!
eng_Latn I thought she'd had it then!
eng_Latn I was so afraid I should have to go away without seeing you again!
eng_Latn or indeed do anything to demonstrate to her that he was truly delighted to see her again.
eng_Latn with signs of hearty good will invited them both to share what they had.
eng_Latn on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat.
eng_Latn law is law.
eng_Latn the murderer, finding that he was not followed
eng_Latn I wished I knew what I was supposed to be feeling.
eng_Latn I hope to do mine.
eng_Latn I only want to be consulted sometimes.
eng_Latn I never noticed before your hair has red in it.
eng_Latn I will help him as much as I can.
eng_Latn passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close ranked trees.
eng_Latn smelled it again
eng_Latn Why not Granny?
eng_Latn I'll do whatever I can to make you happy now.
eng_Latn was tempered with respect and affection.
eng_Latn Wow! How did you know that?
eng_Latn I took apiece of crumpet and divided it between the two dogs.
eng_Latn Mr Picasso. I'm so glad to see you ve picked up your paintbrush again.
eng_Latn to see what it was that made his head feel so cool
eng_Latn but her death shocked me terribly.
eng_Latn what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself.
eng_Latn That be so stylish and cool.
eng_Latn but as suddenly stopped
eng_Latn I'm raising myself.
eng_Latn but when I came to it and opened it I saw that it was a garden room
eng_Latn I almost scream.
eng_Latn the house lay before us.
eng_Latn Hello Granny Pug.
eng_Latn desired them to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries
eng_Latn yet I felt that I ought not to let it be used by some one else instead of me.
eng_Latn Dog unpacked books.
eng_Latn I called out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice.
eng_Latn others were in prison because they had committed crimes of passion or succumbed to a momentary temptation
eng_Latn of the country where they set me on shore
eng_Latn but though he nearly broke the cord no one answered.
eng_Latn I was just worked up to risk coming to the rescue
eng_Latn she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her
eng_Latn I have no seductions now away from home and work.
eng_Latn for one who loves you beyond all else.
eng_Latn Then we must think of another.
eng_Latn prhapse be my death
eng_Latn so it was not long before they were stripped
eng_Latn obliged to get my coals by stratagem
eng_Latn In the autumn it would lose it sleaves and miss them a little.
eng_Latn I'm bought by the government for to day.
eng_Latn I told him to take the cup with me
eng_Latn I'll dress him up for you as fine as you please.
eng_Latn he went down that night.
eng_Latn when I tried it.
eng_Latn all he had to do now was to close his hand.
eng_Latn obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops
eng_Latn I waited a month
eng_Latn his eye twisted by alcohol
eng_Latn he had not moved.
eng_Latn I hope that you didn't do anything illegal
eng_Latn I forget what they did
eng_Latn Plog and Plug
eng_Latn but decided not to.
eng_Latn now it's done.
eng_Latn for love lends wings to our desires
eng_Latn the hunted animal look had partly gone from her eyes.
eng_Latn hurried to the window and tried to open it
eng_Latn I heard him say so.
eng_Latn NOW are you satisfied?
eng_Latn or anywhere else ever again.
eng_Latn for which you must not blame this unhappy knight errant
eng_Latn restored the usual hand to his mouth.
eng_Latn I do not attach any exaggerated importance to my poetical works.
eng_Latn he could not prevent the man seeing him.
eng_Latn Unfortunately a kite won t fly if there isn t any wind. Let us go and explore until there is some.I smell an adventure!
eng_Latn a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position.
eng_Latn I told her my heart belongs to you
eng_Latn as to urge no influence against me.
eng_Latn lotions made with the subacetate of lead, and fomentations of oxycrat.
eng_Latn Happy to help. Climb aboard
eng_Latn No, it's a picture book Pug. But it was here before there was even a shelf to put it on.
eng_Latn why, then the pack saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this gentleman has said.
eng_Latn scratched and bruised but otherwise unharmed.
eng_Latn who had escaped from the local jail earlier that night and were hiding in the chapel.
eng_Latn I was fairly mad at him.
eng_Latn fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.
eng_Latn until we came to the poor person's house
eng_Latn it was evidently useless to resist.
eng_Latn as if they had been pigmies and I a giant.
eng_Latn I didn't know it was like that.
eng_Latn the same words over and over
eng_Latn he leaned over her.
eng_Latn but those I love, I love so that I would give my life for them, and the others I'd throttle if they stood in my way.
eng_Latn a farrier's bill!
eng_Latn when he noticed that the army had set up machine gun emplacements around the small square
eng_Latn my arms frozen to my body.
eng_Latn My name is Willow and everything isgoing wrong again!
eng_Latn with the help of another man laid his burden down.
eng_Latn opens her mouth, closes it again
eng_Latn but his face was beardless
eng_Latn he has opened an account with my house for his son
eng_Latn then from inside the house they saw the glow of a flashlight.
eng_Latn I here take a final leave of all my courteous readers
eng_Latn when I brought out the baked apples from the closet
eng_Latn who could help her husband out with reasons
eng_Latn He/she never lets me win atanything!
eng_Latn she'd been gone this long before.
eng_Latn until she was close enough to give him the full benefit of her anger.
eng_Latn as though sure this couldn't work.
eng_Latn if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do.
eng_Latn Granny Pug is in trouble!
eng_Latn he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along.
eng_Latn he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which
eng_Latn I smiled ruefully.
eng_Latn I've never heard such terrible lies in my whole life.
eng_Latn but the passage was full of people
eng_Latn but all was still as death.
eng_Latn they were still drinking
eng_Latn There are no monsters here.
eng_Latn I have a son too
eng_Latn attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.
eng_Latn which was betrayed and, as people expressed it, drowned in blood.
eng_Latn I stuff the safety instructions quickly back in their pocket
eng_Latn I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one.
eng_Latn everybody knows that.
eng_Latn but she declined availing herself of it
eng_Latn finding them filled with strangers come on here
eng_Latn if when I read you all that about the 'poor knight,' I wished to to praise you for one thing
eng_Latn so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly,
eng_Latn he told her sister was still the same crybaby as ever.
eng_Latn I'd feel too much ashamed and frightened to ever go alone.
eng_Latn you were always somewhere
eng_Latn More prized than gold.
eng_Latn I had a good time tonight.
eng_Latn as a surreptitious glass of brandy!
eng_Latn I shall never see her again!
eng_Latn but be assured we shall take no improper advantage of them.
eng_Latn do anything there is to do about the room.
eng_Latn but I must not talk of what I felt.
eng_Latn I put my fingers into his.
eng_Latn that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on hishead.
eng_Latn but she had not forgotten him.
eng_Latn can be that I am completely in your power.
eng_Latn shivered with cold.
eng_Latn so he at once gave him a drubbing
eng_Latn took up his hat, as if to go.
eng_Latn bending her body as a sign that she returned thanks.
eng_Latn six of us
eng_Latn She went this way.
eng_Latn who will gird on his sword and take his place in the army of his comrades and brothers.
eng_Latn that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death
eng_Latn but in a minute I see I was mistaken
eng_Latn I hoped she wasn't so dissatisfied that she would skip the questions I was waiting for.
eng_Latn maybe you've heard?
eng_Latn but it was done, and I went quickly back to the dining room and reseated myself at the dinner table.
eng_Latn had lost his health ashore
eng_Latn to engulf himself with her.
eng_Latn the player devil must not go off boasting
eng_Latn I can't tell any more than you,' he said.
eng_Latn but neither of us could understand a syllable.
eng_Latn I came down again.
eng_Latn What? Oh. Yes. You know me, Dog. Always keen to help. And not just land on my bottom.
eng_Latn she said, when she had somewhat recovered
eng_Latn there'd be so much to teach you.
eng_Latn which will start on my whistle.
eng_Latn their own five and one more.
eng_Latn dived for in the deep, and featured in the unbodied air!
eng_Latn she knitted her brow
eng_Latn it is more than fraternization, it is equivalent to addressing each other as thou.
eng_Latn waiting to be asked to dance when she was asked for a waltz
eng_Latn I told you
eng_Latn pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.
eng_Latn as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room.
eng_Latn where the pots and kettles were kept.
eng_Latn trying to smother his relief.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book that will help us solve it.
eng_Latn was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them,
eng_Latn the message hidden in the beauty of words.
eng_Latn on the night that followed that famous day
eng_Latn I was determined to change the future.
eng_Latn for they had been brought up together from childhood in her father's house
eng_Latn I just had to get over myself.
eng_Latn she were free now to take her way
eng_Latn if you have revolved to do what you say
eng_Latn however, entirely to relieve you of it
eng_Latn a little oil still lay in the wells.
eng_Latn I will punish you very severely if you disobey these instructions.
eng_Latn I think the arm will make up for the sword.
eng_Latn she turned quickly to hide them and left the room.
eng_Latn Go on. Run away like everyone else.
eng_Latn but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye.
eng_Latn why the watchmen had taken no alarm.
eng_Latn I shimmy close to him and pull one of his hands inside my bra.
eng_Latn that there might be no mistake in the person
eng_Latn with a square cupola, very retired among some trees and a lawn
eng_Latn I sat up and saw the battle over
eng_Latn he cried aloud before all the company
eng_Latn Because they re safe inside them, like we were under the acorn cup.
eng_Latn I wonder if we have a book that might assist you?
eng_Latn I went through then to the little morning room I had not seen before.
eng_Latn exploded her husband.
eng_Latn I don't think it will take much to discredit her account.
eng_Latn he thought suddenly.
eng_Latn the difference was very distressing.
eng_Latn he wrote steadily for fifty minutes
eng_Latn Be careful you don t dig too deep Pug. Who knows what you might find?
eng_Latn I'm the one who was horribly careless.
eng_Latn nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.
eng_Latn when he has come out on the other side of the mud with an ague.
eng_Latn as though she hadn't heard him
eng_Latn I'm against them
eng_Latn so brightly polished that, matching as they did the rest of his apparel
eng_Latn It's working. Excellent distraction work, Pug.
eng_Latn to read it at her ease before she burned it
eng_Latn induces me to hope
eng_Latn looked at it a moment
eng_Latn Dog, look at me. I'm so cold I'm frozen!
eng_Latn all his attendants were in the same state of amazement.
eng_Latn I never mean to.
eng_Latn that is joy
eng_Latn the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat
eng_Latn I just thought you should know the direction he's headed.
eng_Latn I assure you she did.
eng_Latn the first is that I have made your acquaintance
eng_Latn or, in short, vanquish and subdue him
eng_Latn And now we can go about ourbusiness.
eng_Latn but remembering that there might be spectators
eng_Latn locked the room door behind him.
eng_Latn my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar
eng_Latn I didn't like it, either.
eng_Latn I put my left hand in his
eng_Latn I will only add now
eng_Latn I'm going to make us a nice cup of tea.
eng_Latn they stopped and I stopped.
eng_Latn ...I love reading a soothing book at bedtime to the bookshop mice.
eng_Latn I put it just here.
eng_Latn they shook hands again.
eng_Latn partly because you were poorly
eng_Latn who was directing his steps
eng_Latn be not forgetful of prayer.
eng_Latn 12. he is kind and compassionate to the poor and weak persons
eng_Latn that his head was caked with dry blood
eng_Latn he turned into that with the panelled bed
eng_Latn she understood that her fate was sealed.
eng_Latn I gazed steadily at my plate.
eng_Latn there seemed to be a lot of cars standing about.
eng_Latn he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead
eng_Latn I mean, I haven't really made much effort
eng_Latn there's anything to do
eng_Latn there had been no time for anything except love.
eng_Latn a dry crackling was heard.
eng_Latn OR perhaps we have a book that will tell us what to do?
eng_Latn has cast a gloom over the county.
eng_Latn being more independent in circumstances.
eng_Latn though there seemed no chance
eng_Latn he loved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love.
eng_Latn I chuckled in sudden relief.
eng_Latn The end!
eng_Latn she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.
eng_Latn he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time
eng_Latn averting my eyes.
eng_Latn but the space was longer and narrower
eng_Latn I should think shed be ashamed of herself if she has.
eng_Latn I told him all my secrets.
eng_Latn but only so far as to be silent.
eng_Latn Yum! Lead the way!
eng_Latn had stated quite clearly that
eng_Latn then my blood crept cold through my veins.
eng_Latn it was always the same.
eng_Latn he must depart from the country.
eng_Latn I mustn't beg.
eng_Latn while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing
eng_Latn I don't like to lie
eng_Latn I had a line about my waist
eng_Latn the man on the floor cried suddenly, and then was silent.
eng_Latn but I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.
eng_Latn each side of the wall being five hundred feet long.
eng_Latn the same as entre chien et loup between dog and wolf signifies the evening.
eng_Latn when I found my feet again
eng_Latn But really it's not a very talldog. It's us!
eng_Latn I was shrined in double retirement.
eng_Latn who attends my mother
eng_Latn looked ahead of her intently at the bonnet of the car in profound meditation.
eng_Latn Where shall we go?
eng_Latn the state of his mind is as clear and decided
eng_Latn it'll be on your side
eng_Latn the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar.
eng_Latn Hm I suppose we should have seen that coming.
eng_Latn I must have been either ten or eleven when I started reading
eng_Latn which she did with right good will
eng_Latn I took leave.
eng_Latn as if toil were life itself
eng_Latn for a long while her trembling hands could not find the matches and light another candle, instead of the one that had burned down and gone out.
eng_Latn I followed that of letters
eng_Latn they must go softly
eng_Latn but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate.
eng_Latn I need someone like you.
eng_Latn war are the same thing
eng_Latn This is a book all about hiding and finding precious things. And it is called...
eng_Latn explain your son's character.
eng_Latn that smile had also been like the old king's smile.
eng_Latn in token of forgiveness of my anger
eng_Latn That was amazing Dog... making theMoon sneeze moon dust to cover the whole world! How did you get to be so clever?
eng_Latn upstairs almost all the rooms were finished.
eng_Latn feeling in his pocket and finding twenty copecks
eng_Latn questioned her as to her misfortune
eng_Latn that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death
eng_Latn Mice, it's time to go home.
eng_Latn I am quite at home in her house.
eng_Latn I thought he would return to you.
eng_Latn when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room door.
eng_Latn missed several chances of forcing an engagement.
eng_Latn in half an hour she spied me.
eng_Latn now it's done.
eng_Latn I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse now
eng_Latn I tested the elastic band, struggling to force it to remain solid as I stretched it away from me.
eng_Latn In the summer it was green with leaves and enjoyed the sun.
eng_Latn I breathed again.
eng_Latn Splendid! You ve found my hat. Oh. My wand. And all my bunnies!
eng_Latn but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips
eng_Latn as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.
eng_Latn I’m having trouble making my bed. Do you do duvets?
eng_Latn Not the book, Dog. It's a mystery why...
eng_Latn I am reading forbidden books.
eng_Latn I'd better find some food for you, he said in a quiet voice, and he gently unwound my arms.
eng_Latn And so Colin the castaway went back to being alone, but wasn t very lonely at all.
eng_Latn they raised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle
eng_Latn nothing was left.
eng_Latn what was there to dismiss!
eng_Latn because he never imagined how much she loved him.
eng_Latn I do not even want you to speak to her again.
eng_Latn for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her
eng_Latn for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation.
eng_Latn I don t like swabbing the decks Dog.
eng_Latn he found a wounded panther
eng_Latn I stepped over the great western gate.
eng_Latn as if it knew it was perfectly safe.
eng_Latn where he revived his noisy revelry and unlimited gourmandizing.
eng_Latn he will bring his witnesses
eng_Latn but he had them taken down
eng_Latn I say, this is folly!
eng_Latn I smell something fishy. Time tofollow my nose.
eng_Latn I think it's smallest burger EVER!
eng_Latn then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.
eng_Latn in this way we shall be satisfied and easy
eng_Latn quite pleased apparently.
eng_Latn he told her sister was still the same crybaby as ever.
eng_Latn wiped the dust off with the sleeve of her shirt.
eng_Latn but I've got a good place.
eng_Latn but observe I was only speaking by way of a general proposition.
eng_Latn your gesture, your movement
eng_Latn I opened the book at random, as she proposed
eng_Latn then we will go to bed.
eng_Latn stamped his feet in his impatience.
eng_Latn I had not thought of that.
eng_Latn I must tell you that I thought it my duty to dissuade her.
eng_Latn except I don't like any of the things that have been happening.
eng_Latn that no one had ever painted a picture like it.
eng_Latn I saw him''she lowered her voice and leaned toward me''change.
eng_Latn as if his death had been not his own decision
eng_Latn I HAD led this life about a month
eng_Latn I thought it was rather a short name, yesterday,' I confessed.
eng_Latn in order to discover the privileges of simplicity almost forty years late.
eng_Latn when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round
eng_Latn implore him to be a merciful ass
eng_Latn I knew how he felt.
eng_Latn he threw himself upon the body of the child
eng_Latn looking so earnestly at her father
eng_Latn truly magnanimous man, your very humble and very obedient servant
eng_Latn I am a selfish girl!
eng_Latn I want to know what's going on.
eng_Latn he was interested in her.
eng_Latn but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut.
eng_Latn we stayed behind
eng_Latn it's very unbecoming.
eng_Latn I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can.
eng_Latn I look around
eng_Latn as if toil were life itself
eng_Latn A very special prize Pug.
eng_Latn you must look once.
eng_Latn eddying darkness seemed to swim round me
eng_Latn but characteristic and useful
eng_Latn you sully my honour.
eng_Latn pulled a sack of tobacco and a book of papers from his side pocket.
eng_Latn I must keep her near me.
eng_Latn only eighteen were left after the charge.
eng_Latn I have come to tell you that this must end.
eng_Latn I was cook in.
eng_Latn took up his hat, as if to go.
eng_Latn I can marry the person I want, I guess.
eng_Latn which had her at its beck and call
eng_Latn I leave behind me as a pledge this pin
eng_Latn that ain't any use.
eng_Latn I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me
eng_Latn she thanked them all for having entertained her so well.
eng_Latn where we had a very comfortable dinner, and passed the day with great satisfaction.
eng_Latn one in particular who is always persecuting him
eng_Latn I know you didn't mean to but you DID do it.
eng_Latn when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture
eng_Latn it must've been really bad
eng_Latn I've brought you a letter.
eng_Latn had his meals as usual
eng_Latn I've taken care of myself since I was eleven that's when my mother died.
eng_Latn I told your daughter that she is like a rose.
eng_Latn that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first!
eng_Latn I'm afraid I am late for an engagement.
eng_Latn who was apparently on his deathbed
eng_Latn but was at any rate an officer's wife.
eng_Latn he arose saying that he must go, that he had to get up early in the morning.
eng_Latn although she had learned to soften it.
eng_Latn There weren t no treasure in it.
eng_Latn here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.
eng_Latn rather, you need not think of her at all.
eng_Latn his absence was a relief to me.
eng_Latn next they thought of the stolen meat
eng_Latn the same words over and over
eng_Latn the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been.
eng_Latn that you intend breakfasting with me
eng_Latn I was looking for a job
eng_Latn I know we're going to getalong.
eng_Latn all those hours in the library.
eng_Latn he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.
eng_Latn he was interested in her.
eng_Latn when I brought out the baked apples from the closet
eng_Latn if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it me
eng_Latn with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment
eng_Latn I shut my eyes, trying to gather some courage
eng_Latn perhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough to make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of exalting.
eng_Latn I'm sure you are fond of each other ' er ' very deep down.
eng_Latn I shall return
eng_Latn as if it boded ill omen to his venture.
eng_Latn Puggy-Back Rides!
eng_Latn I'm not doing any good here.
eng_Latn I could take you to the cleaners!
eng_Latn she and I were alone.
eng_Latn to recover my breath and loss of spirits.
eng_Latn in order to postpone their arrival.
eng_Latn that's a thing to remember, that letter _a_
eng_Latn but there is always a temptation to take advantage of the love of those who are absolutely delivered into your hands.
eng_Latn WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread
eng_Latn perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company
eng_Latn carefully administered the appointed number of drops
eng_Latn I'd like to see you try it.
eng_Latn slipped out into the entrance hall.
eng_Latn I was just going to have to take the torture like a man.
eng_Latn surrounding his house
eng_Latn for I measured the latter on purpose, after my return.
eng_Latn perceived that what he said about his improvement was true
eng_Latn I jolted upright, shocked out of the dream.
eng_Latn I returned home
eng_Latn I hope there's something good for lunch
eng_Latn where a hand grenade was fastened to the belt
eng_Latn you'll cry and let them go.
eng_Latn his pounding with the flat of his hand on her bedroom door.
eng_Latn turned and went due east again.
eng_Latn I hate fainting in front of a roomful of men.
eng_Latn The game is afoot!
eng_Latn I must look about for a wife for him.
eng_Latn incline him to be satisfied with the match.
eng_Latn you can see it from the back by leaning over the hedge.
eng_Latn Now we need to be quiet.
eng_Latn please remember that it is after nine o'clock.
eng_Latn consequently, decay, and consume in a few months.
eng_Latn The game is no longer afoot. It's two feet!
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn he had some other feelings towards women than towards grouse and foxes
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer!
eng_Latn but it was not his tractor.
eng_Latn rather flustered by this onslaught.
eng_Latn he could not have been more than thirty
eng_Latn shut the gate on the mob
eng_Latn with looks and gestures that clearly were unstudied.
eng_Latn Have you seen our leaf anywhere?
eng_Latn which knocked him backward onto the floor.
eng_Latn will show the thread of her coarse homespun stuff.
eng_Latn it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.
eng_Latn he had a very good time.
eng_Latn please remember that it is after nine o'clock.
eng_Latn the brink of my transformation from mortal to immortal.
eng_Latn I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice, she began.
eng_Latn to pray for a willow pattern tea set of her very own.
eng_Latn I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by and bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
eng_Latn but they paused to listen.
eng_Latn We are back where we started!
eng_Latn I am not used to stringing words together properly
eng_Latn What are you seeking?
eng_Latn Bookshop mice! That isn t very mice at all!
eng_Latn hurried up to the house top.
eng_Latn their children grown and well behaved
eng_Latn his belly cascading over the waistband of his tight bluejeans, determined to not miss a bet, to do all the right things.
eng_Latn I assured her we were alone.
eng_Latn but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag's mouth.
eng_Latn we had shoved off and given way.
eng_Latn that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation.
eng_Latn who was unable to do anything in 1807
eng_Latn ever came back to the parish again
eng_Latn I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized.
eng_Latn in the common room that night.
eng_Latn he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately!
eng_Latn I don't care about lessening the sentence!
eng_Latn THE prince now left the room and shut himself up in his own chamber.
eng_Latn I am at your service, sir, in the matter
eng_Latn than by pointing to the door
eng_Latn he did not even dare to dream of that , but simply to die before his eyes.
eng_Latn I've got all my faculties as well as ever I had in my life.
eng_Latn to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion,
eng_Latn saw them admitted by the porter.
eng_Latn I saw him''she lowered her voice and leaned toward me''change.
eng_Latn I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn then licked some up on his tongue.
eng_Latn I don't like to see you quarrelling.
eng_Latn kneel down kneel round her
eng_Latn we will stay together.
eng_Latn then, the dungeon returned.
eng_Latn You re a chef?
eng_Latn I left a basket of clothes on the porch.
eng_Latn but the obvious choice as ever failed.
eng_Latn The World of the Weird.
eng_Latn he trailed himself across the deck.
eng_Latn I'd been expecting it to be difficult.
eng_Latn but he held her back.
eng_Latn Oh Yes. Thank you. (Reading) And best of all.. I love books that can also be plays!
eng_Latn attracted the best qualified gluttons from all along the coast.
eng_Latn they put a pile of dry hay in the middle of the street
eng_Latn that was all.
eng_Latn but he restrained himself.
eng_Latn I want to make things better. Now let s start with you. Tell me about yourself
eng_Latn if you've got a hat, bring it along to hide your face.
eng_Latn I recognized my cue.
eng_Latn until she reached the pillar box.
eng_Latn if you had any decency you d jump in a lake.
eng_Latn he was soaring upward.
eng_Latn that smile had also been like the old king's smile.
eng_Latn I was too thirsty.
eng_Latn he came to fetch his spade, that he had forgotten.
eng_Latn Even an adventurous Granny like me sometimes needs a special place to find a little peace.
eng_Latn Oh What can I do to help you?
eng_Latn she looked very little like a devotee.
eng_Latn then he jerked his head around to look again.
eng_Latn it was simply a question of patience.
eng_Latn with terrible strength he drew the man's arm over his right shoulder
eng_Latn my mother and he had another stroll by the sweetbriar
eng_Latn kick of a horse crushed his chest and a crowd of outsiders saw him die in the middle of the street
eng_Latn I never had my family stuck out on the road.
eng_Latn their hair had turned a bright red.
eng_Latn Snark. Snark.
eng_Latn the young men self consciously clutching their hats
eng_Latn Let's Goat to work!
eng_Latn that's how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen.
eng_Latn because solitude had made a selection in her memory
eng_Latn I miss my truck, I whimpered to myself.
eng_Latn Mice, I know it's good to besomewhere, but could you please be somewhere else?
eng_Latn sit on your front porch and admire the view without paying attention to your needs
eng_Latn they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.
eng_Latn acceptance of the good advice that had been offered to him
eng_Latn I don't want to talk about convicts any more.
eng_Latn knock off a buck an' a half.
eng_Latn an old knapsack, and a huge thorn cudgel shod with iron at both ends.
eng_Latn but I am conscious that it has no originality.
eng_Latn Next time I want an adventure holiday, I'm booking it with you.
eng_Latn in obedience to the doctor's impulse, home they went.
eng_Latn he would never make that mistake again.
eng_Latn simple earthly accessories put on sale without any fuss by peddlers of everyday reality.
eng_Latn although he must be miserable without them.
eng_Latn we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them.
eng_Latn he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
eng_Latn which made them all laugh, and they said it was a prime good hit.
eng_Latn see if there wasanything wrong in his understanding of it.
eng_Latn I was very happy, however, nearly all the time.
eng_Latn if it did not terminate as she wished.
eng_Latn My Kite! It's flying Dog!
eng_Latn they went away together
eng_Latn I don't know nothing much about it.
eng_Latn I assure you mine are very different.
eng_Latn this ringing, high pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.
eng_Latn for if you are killed I shall be alone in the world
eng_Latn And a down-looking clown.
eng_Latn I paid sixpence more for my dinner
eng_Latn partly in modest propitiation of everybody else.
eng_Latn perhaps you'd better come, too
eng_Latn he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks
eng_Latn held it up again with an exclamation of horror.
eng_Latn that she was in his confidence that night.
eng_Latn he got gingerly to his feet
eng_Latn but every character first rate, and three principal women.
eng_Latn but he flung away all the twenty five at once!
eng_Latn now it all cuts both ways,
eng_Latn what they had was secured to your mother and to you.
eng_Latn That s because this is before anyairports were invented Pug. But it is the right time for a song!
eng_Latn eyes wide in the dark.
eng_Latn had the same artificial appearance as the hair on the saints.
eng_Latn but I wish it to be so, if you please, for convenience' sake.
eng_Latn the poor old man did die
eng_Latn Agghh! It IS maths homework!
eng_Latn She feels rather differently.
eng_Latn I remarked laughingly on the change in his present circumstances from those when we had both been medical students.
eng_Latn he loved the sea and love
eng_Latn flipped over the postcard.
eng_Latn then, without waiting for an answer
eng_Latn having kept this up as long as one would be saying a credo
eng_Latn the cabbie poked his nose through the screen into the rear compartment.
eng_Latn none was even better than one.
eng_Latn I drove back and forth between the bookstore and the restaurant a few times, hoping to see her on her way.
eng_Latn I'll never be ready.
eng_Latn the divine goodness of her smile of compassion.
eng_Latn in hunger and thirst, cold and heat,
eng_Latn I didn't know I should do that.
eng_Latn Help! It's after my curds and whey!
eng_Latn but nobody spoke.
eng_Latn proceeding to remark on the rare beauty of the day.
eng_Latn I grew three inches in a year, got my long trousers
eng_Latn I haven't seen him all day.
eng_Latn How about a quick game of hide andseek before we shut up shop? What do you say Pug?
eng_Latn I held out my hand
eng_Latn which I would gladly have enjoyed longer
eng_Latn Quick! Time for a pic.
eng_Latn our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the first.
eng_Latn when I was five years old
eng_Latn you made a fine fuss with him when he came.
eng_Latn blind of one eye and not very sound in the other.
eng_Latn has cast a gloom over the county.
eng_Latn he would bury him in bubbles and foam.
eng_Latn even if he doesn't love me.
eng_Latn subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary
eng_Latn I heard since my return, that his ship foundered
eng_Latn I don't wonder at it.
eng_Latn he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it.
eng_Latn what a happy day we've had altogether.
eng_Latn but lingered at a little distance
eng_Latn but only that you would show yourself in his doorway.
eng_Latn if I whistle, he'll run in.
eng_Latn I cautiously asked him what he was doing.
eng_Latn for there were to be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given him
eng_Latn at the foot of the scaffold
eng_Latn but no one ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.
eng_Latn to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet
eng_Latn I don t think that detector wasmade for detecting socks Pug.
eng_Latn that he watched his opportunity
eng_Latn she is not likely to go visiting on such a day.
eng_Latn refreshed and renewed, at the unusual hour of eleven o' clock
eng_Latn it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening
eng_Latn for the hair came with the papers
eng_Latn what was worse, serious diseases with the symptoms of minor ones.
eng_Latn the old scamp will be condemned.
eng_Latn NEWEverything was so clear.
eng_Latn but not many had died there.
eng_Latn who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box
eng_Latn you'll cry and let them go.
eng_Latn I was glad when it was all over.
eng_Latn the finding of the knife near the corpse.
eng_Latn I need not go, I am sure, I answered.
eng_Latn perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it.
eng_Latn she might almost think that nothing had changed.
eng_Latn judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.
eng_Latn that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say
eng_Latn I couldn't see no more eyes though.
eng_Latn but probably unaware of it.
eng_Latn shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowser! We re in China! What a brilliant spot to fly my kite.
eng_Latn but I know that I shall hardly live three hours.
eng_Latn I ll be very careful from now on Dog. I don t want to dig up anything unexpected.
eng_Latn snapping open her black silk fan to its widest.
eng_Latn but you go and hand the sauces.
eng_Latn awake, and look at me!
eng_Latn if I am victorious
eng_Latn because I was very certain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing.
eng_Latn but nothing happened.
eng_Latn was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called.
eng_Latn because I have no friends now
eng_Latn this is not a voice she ever heard.
eng_Latn he said, raising his hat
eng_Latn Let us consult the map Pug.
eng_Latn pulling at the reins.
eng_Latn for there was traces of blood
eng_Latn but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way.
eng_Latn that they did not enter the ballroom till late.
eng_Latn or giving the least sign of her activity
eng_Latn I thought it best to comply with their proposal.
eng_Latn but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.
eng_Latn a cup not so big as a nut shell
eng_Latn relieving him of the visor, already battered to pieces by blows
eng_Latn no one ever dared go inside
eng_Latn I'll not risk my heart a third time.
eng_Latn hadn't been used to that sort of thing
eng_Latn We re coming Granny Pug!
eng_Latn he followed into a large dark room, at a distance.
eng_Latn I thought about that for a moment.
eng_Latn has black beard of a week's growth.
eng_Latn with his elbows raised squarely, he twisted both ends of his flaming moustaches
eng_Latn I fell from the garret just in the same way a year ago.
eng_Latn that there was nothing else left for him
eng_Latn only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith,
eng_Latn if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.
eng_Latn irregular verbs are mere playthings.
eng_Latn hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.
eng_Latn he pocketed the bill
eng_Latn the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight
eng_Latn you two need to run.
eng_Latn a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery.
eng_Latn dressed in full mourning
eng_Latn he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all...
eng_Latn had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed
eng_Latn as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view, and likely to be useful.
eng_Latn Forsooth! Who are you?!
eng_Latn but with a simpering boy's face
eng_Latn obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more
eng_Latn make certain that their glasses were full.
eng_Latn that is wonderfully true.
eng_Latn unless indeed it be that the victor have lost his own in the combat
eng_Latn he dashing to the door to make sure.
eng_Latn I want your permission to save her life.
eng_Latn I'm alive to day, but to morrow
eng_Latn I try to smile, but my face won't quite do it.
eng_Latn I can see the pole star!
eng_Latn walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence
eng_Latn MNoirtier looked after the servant until the door was closed
eng_Latn with something under their arm
eng_Latn I was on the point of chaffing him on his state.
eng_Latn I will fall at his feet and beseech him.
eng_Latn I was off to one side
eng_Latn Being different sizes won t be aproblem for pushing and swinging.
eng_Latn They say no man is an island, but if one was his name would probably be Colin.
eng_Latn it's human nature.
eng_Latn dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table.
eng_Latn but the color was washed out now
eng_Latn to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting
eng_Latn a portly ghost approached the table
eng_Latn but he did not like to be questioned while he was reading
eng_Latn YOU ARE BANISHED TO THE LAND OFHORRIBLE HAIRY SPIDERS AND YOU HAVE TO GO TO BED EARLY!
eng_Latn I reckon you're cracking up.
eng_Latn I reminded him.
eng_Latn having learnt the art in my youth.
eng_Latn somehow made her usually soft voice heard above the tumult.
eng_Latn but I am a poor student, and I have my way to make.
eng_Latn I heard what you said about my dog!
eng_Latn I wondered whether you'd be kind enough to advise me.
eng_Latn Do giant giants like little pugs?
eng_Latn the president offered him the side of the railing
eng_Latn there miserably howled
eng_Latn so clear was the road left for him
eng_Latn because I have no friends now
eng_Latn I was feeling hurt because he had just disappeared into blankness without a word.
eng_Latn like we're all in now.
eng_Latn if you ever want to see him at all.
eng_Latn now let us talk about our own affairs.
eng_Latn endless erratic shapes dropped and smeared from the door to the kitchen.
eng_Latn pulled his right foot as hard as he could away from the grassy ceiling.
eng_Latn put on the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear.
eng_Latn I just looked straight ahead.
eng_Latn are not too much
eng_Latn it depends what trees and what men.
eng_Latn whether that consoling reflection was logical or not.
eng_Latn but at present I do not see what there is to question.
eng_Latn had been taught to pity me.
eng_Latn they were on not so intimate terms.
eng_Latn but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips
eng_Latn I'm such a silly, she said plaintively.
eng_Latn pull you down with him.
eng_Latn so clear was the road left for him
eng_Latn renouncing his claim
eng_Latn I acted like a madman in coming in here
eng_Latn Mrs Hargûşa Şîrînein the Friendly Forest. Chapter One.
eng_Latn they're going to save us all.
eng_Latn even though he had not believed in it till then.
eng_Latn giving them the tufted look of a lynx's ears.
eng_Latn he was down there visiting it.
eng_Latn it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.
eng_Latn looking around him once more.
eng_Latn its dark high corridors awash with quietness and a tangible holiness.
eng_Latn were it requisite to attend your magnificence as squire
eng_Latn but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.
eng_Latn let me put up this she ass at my house and I'll be back at once.
eng_Latn when he has driven out the invader
eng_Latn We were!
eng_Latn obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more
eng_Latn that strangely enough by the one girl of this upper level
eng_Latn I smell a mystery! Guard the provisions Pug while I find their owner.
eng_Latn he was willing to sacrifice anyone to his appetites.
eng_Latn six of us
eng_Latn suddenly feeling very much out of place and alone
eng_Latn so I bid him take the road lower down.
eng_Latn seized a candelabra and dashed it to the ground.
eng_Latn we've got big plans for this money.
eng_Latn the hand holding onto the canvas was a skeleton covered with wrinkled skin.
eng_Latn for I was going home to the funeral.
eng_Latn but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husband vindicated
eng_Latn it would be difficult to say
eng_Latn make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to bestow upon you
eng_Latn a girl of about fifteen ducked out, straightened.
eng_Latn MOOOOO! You shouldn t creep up on people like that! It makes me nervous.
eng_Latn Umm I think you may be looking foranswers in the wrong place Pug.
eng_Latn I've seen him. I thought I was going to turn into a pillar of salt.
eng_Latn burning under the infernal three o' clock sun
eng_Latn you ain't so sure you can whup me anyways.
eng_Latn shotgun in his hands.
eng_Latn money to eat
eng_Latn which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.
eng_Latn but it never entered my head that it was you,
eng_Latn I felt a moment of unease.
eng_Latn I just want you to say if you can
eng_Latn with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment
eng_Latn I've got to get back to him.
eng_Latn I did the work I was fit for.
eng_Latn I learned that much at sea.
eng_Latn This is my new favourite book! And now I know how to solve a puzzle - by looking at it differently. Taking the Squirrel to the Smoothie is really, really hard. But taking the Smoothie to the Squirrel is easy-peasy!
eng_Latn that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away.
eng_Latn I will not be interrupted because of that bastard.
eng_Latn he must have more than that.
eng_Latn Umm, Enid. Is there really a mysterious gang of spies? And a dastardly Doctor Badd? Do you really even have an Uncle Quentin?
eng_Latn waiting, until it should be introduced by some decisive event.
eng_Latn then who wants to be mutilated?
eng_Latn I have seen nothing but kindness and affection from her towards myself.
eng_Latn awaited his directions.
eng_Latn I'd give my life to serve you.
eng_Latn which had not been in any degree her own fault
eng_Latn it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch.
eng_Latn unless he cut her off entirely.
eng_Latn was seated at the breakfast table.
eng_Latn I would be identified as having been with her.
eng_Latn but he could read people like a book.
eng_Latn however, entirely to relieve you of it
eng_Latn I thought I could have done some good.
eng_Latn for he knew that the authorities were wrong.
eng_Latn I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind acknowledging 't I'm right down scared.
eng_Latn regretting their friend's flow of cleverness.
eng_Latn I was wide awake every time.
eng_Latn found there a stoutish, middle aged person
eng_Latn but of the primitive manner of the people.
eng_Latn she returned and stood by his pillow.
eng_Latn yet I gave you two hundred francs when I left three months ago
eng_Latn I have not prepared my judgment.
eng_Latn the more's the pity!
eng_Latn I wonder what it is?
eng_Latn like a friend come back from a long absence.
eng_Latn I'll give you the list later.
eng_Latn I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.
eng_Latn I can never grow out of that.
eng_Latn I told your daughter that she is like a rose.
eng_Latn stopped quite near the approaching train.
eng_Latn I came down again.
eng_Latn We re back Dog!
eng_Latn we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind,
eng_Latn now be quiet
eng_Latn he was left lying down and alone
eng_Latn Aye, Aye, Captain!
eng_Latn And was once more known as The World s Greatest Acrobat!
eng_Latn obviously anxious to be taken seriously by a girl like herself, as she could see.
eng_Latn I was but am now back again
eng_Latn solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me.
eng_Latn I will tell you everything when I see you.
eng_Latn a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before.
eng_Latn I stared into his eyes and heard my own voice for the first time.
eng_Latn all was still in shadow
eng_Latn was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat.
eng_Latn together with a checkered blue and white flannel skirt
eng_Latn if we just ignore it
eng_Latn I only wish to say two or three words to your master
eng_Latn than surprise at there being any men in the world
eng_Latn then he might easily discover the truth.
eng_Latn the house had burned down
eng_Latn as if his death had been not his own decision
eng_Latn went to the back porch and out through the gate.
eng_Latn however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several passages.
eng_Latn he pocketed the bill
eng_Latn even if I have to kill you.
eng_Latn I'm not going to ask you again.
eng_Latn she had just come from another village
eng_Latn with dignity put his hand into the old man's hairy palm.
eng_Latn I love books that can carry me away to...
eng_Latn indeed, it was soon plain to me that
eng_Latn it was nasty!
eng_Latn ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped off the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.
eng_Latn then he paused
eng_Latn everybody was always good mannered where he was.
eng_Latn making no movement but to possess himself of my hand.
eng_Latn it probably smelled good to everyone else.
eng_Latn What is that Pug?
eng_Latn its so long since weve seen each other theres nothing much to say.
eng_Latn I don't want you to do anything
eng_Latn drivers switched off their engines and milled about, stretching their legs.
eng_Latn I don't want to start over.
eng_Latn I asked you to get out.
eng_Latn whom he loved as if he were a human being
eng_Latn ....do you remember the book where we met our feline friend, the Cheshire Cat....
eng_Latn walked to the centre of the terrace, and stood in front of the prince's chair.
eng_Latn sob for the old days.
eng_Latn it incited him.
eng_Latn or rather your wife only told us
eng_Latn her whole body seemed to swell up like a bullfrog's.
eng_Latn he opened the door
eng_Latn looked as if her nerves were quivering with the expectation that something would be thrown at her.
eng_Latn to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives.
eng_Latn I'll wait till he leaves
eng_Latn Kites were first made in China thousands of years ago...
eng_Latn brought me within three yards of his eyes.
eng_Latn get me ready something hot for breakfast
eng_Latn come to me, and I will fill it.
eng_Latn I need your help to stop this.
eng_Latn that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.
eng_Latn this morning there was a fresh quarrel
eng_Latn I had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts.
eng_Latn I'm sorry,' I said.
eng_Latn he would say no word that might disturb her peace or spoil her tranquil sense of comradeship.
eng_Latn trying to smother his relief.
eng_Latn made shift to avert it.
eng_Latn I kept my voice light.
eng_Latn because he wasn't treating him quite as he liked,
eng_Latn you should always strive to see clearly around you
eng_Latn her brother un hooked the swingle tree from the wagon
eng_Latn they will carry you ashore?
eng_Latn bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.
eng_Latn you children have broken my heart between you.
eng_Latn he opened the door
eng_Latn held by young men or girls or old men or middle aged women
eng_Latn I told him what I wanted and put the book into his hands
eng_Latn that she had shared the grief of the family
eng_Latn went together into the granary
eng_Latn stealing the part of her grandmother's love that belonged to her.
eng_Latn how I saved his life
eng_Latn I looked back up from my homework'comforting
eng_Latn I was forced to meet him again at supper.
eng_Latn I was cook in.
eng_Latn so many great princes and captains were assembled.
eng_Latn that wasn't all
eng_Latn her jaw dropping as she looked after the carriage with passionate curiosity.
eng_Latn the chances that may come to us on the way.
eng_Latn I think the right breast is very well painted.
eng_Latn Welcome to the Hey-On-Diddle Sports Day.
eng_Latn not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful.
eng_Latn put up in the drawing room.
eng_Latn though he was too courteous to speak openly
eng_Latn had twice regained his commission.
eng_Latn Goodbye Granny. Goodbye, Mr Walrus.
eng_Latn that I didn't come home to dinner.
eng_Latn he's an internationally famous wizard already!
eng_Latn I have truly pointed out to you and in allhelpfulness the only way the only way
eng_Latn I checked them all out.
eng_Latn I must also return to the feast.
eng_Latn so clear was the road left for him
eng_Latn Can I come to work with you?
eng_Latn let me ask you
eng_Latn I shall need you.
eng_Latn he had seen the body of the commander
eng_Latn I'll see to it personally.
eng_Latn I might be able to be of some service.
eng_Latn they sat down.
eng_Latn I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.
eng_Latn I will put you to the proof, and this very moment.
eng_Latn will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.
eng_Latn a man often had to walk through the scrub.
eng_Latn The circus!
eng_Latn then he turned to me, scolding and questioning me.
eng_Latn yield immediately to the young man's request, but made a few conscientious objections
eng_Latn but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were not yet dressed.
eng_Latn Finished!
eng_Latn congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade.
eng_Latn but he had a dream, and he had met with a king.
eng_Latn but make him understand what I mean, in the properest way.
eng_Latn but she soon realized that
eng_Latn I was left as weak as ever I had been
eng_Latn I must go and put the car away.
eng_Latn declared he had said a very good thing.
eng_Latn where she left me alone.
eng_Latn I need not go, I am sure, I answered.
eng_Latn open the door!
eng_Latn he was hopeful that they could be tamed.
eng_Latn NOW are you satisfied?
eng_Latn peered over the wall to the broad smooth plain of cement.
eng_Latn clutched his arm fearfully.
eng_Latn who had left the room after delivering the letter
eng_Latn I could shut my eyes an' walk right there.
eng_Latn I think I see where I went wrong.
eng_Latn but her smile seemed studied.
eng_Latn with the captain's command to fetch me on board.
eng_Latn I will remember it, said the young man
eng_Latn I'll open the other side of my heart to you.
eng_Latn something more than they did!
eng_Latn I need more than five.
eng_Latn but he had never yet seen it as it was to day.
eng_Latn why, she is too old for such pettishness.
eng_Latn putting the packet in his pocket, left the shed.
eng_Latn I loved it.
eng_Latn as he filled most of the corridor in his moleskin overcoat.
eng_Latn biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away
eng_Latn I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.
eng_Latn one would lose too much time over it.
eng_Latn walked on tiptoes to his room.
eng_Latn should he retreat after going so far?
eng_Latn I wasn't in a very good mood
eng_Latn the divine goodness of her smile of compassion.
eng_Latn of discovering an enemy
eng_Latn but that I differed very much from the rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin
eng_Latn I'm not doing this for you.
eng_Latn you tell them so, and that they must stop this
eng_Latn Snark!
eng_Latn surprisingly, for less strain than this had frequently brought on fainting fits.
eng_Latn its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away.
eng_Latn introduced him into society
eng_Latn the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it.
eng_Latn I haven't got any money
eng_Latn I was wide awake every time.
eng_Latn others were in prison because they had committed crimes of passion or succumbed to a momentary temptation
eng_Latn had his meals as usual
eng_Latn some of you will see before the end of the class.
eng_Latn I clung with both hands
eng_Latn pointing to his mare
eng_Latn wherever I may be I'll come to have one more talk with you
eng_Latn giving them the tufted look of a lynx's ears.
eng_Latn it must've been really bad
eng_Latn indicating a comfortable chair for him.
eng_Latn Reading books are for reading tome.
eng_Latn after he had called you murderer to your face,
eng_Latn When the day of the Grand Opening finally came, Dog had a bath.
eng_Latn You are not the only ones who may be peckish... Listen...
eng_Latn How long is your new idea going totake Pug?
eng_Latn it is high time to forgive and forget
eng_Latn I'll go crazy if I think about losing him now.
eng_Latn which was a new and higher kind of strength.
eng_Latn one must set one's own fantasy to the violin, and carry one's self to the post.
eng_Latn I'll pay you for it?
eng_Latn all too human creatures.
eng_Latn I got dry in the boat.
eng_Latn that smile had also been like the old king's smile.
eng_Latn I really want to meet new friendstoo but....
eng_Latn accurately so that there won't be any mistakes as to their time.
eng_Latn when she was in the cabin,
eng_Latn unscrewed the metal cap
eng_Latn there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him
eng_Latn Oh dear. Giants are the one thing my master fears.
eng_Latn I heard a little gasp and I looked up.
eng_Latn he had upset his father, and that the old man
eng_Latn under that sky there, every day.
eng_Latn that is what I intended.
eng_Latn coming down from the hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the straw loft.
eng_Latn i told him as I should have to take you away.
eng_Latn assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done
eng_Latn date it one month later
eng_Latn whether they expected to.
eng_Latn and characteristically asked us to provide the offering.
eng_Latn he had made her for himself.
eng_Latn but he left, shutting the door with a snap.
eng_Latn Thank you Sir Dog and Sir Pug, Knights of the Round Table!
eng_Latn I made him enter a narrow gully of the spur, a dank twilight place overgrown with weeds.
eng_Latn he loved the sea and love
eng_Latn that he had not even presence of mind enough
eng_Latn I returned home
eng_Latn don't be afraid.
eng_Latn stable boy, spruce and smart in his holiday attire, met them with a broom in his hand, and followed them.
eng_Latn he asked me to go with him and I didnt.
eng_Latn was one of the licensed pilots of the port
eng_Latn she heaved a deep sigh of relief
eng_Latn Ancient Egypt ... Outer Space ... King Arthur ... I can t decide which story I want to read. So this is perfect!
eng_Latn if it did not terminate as she wished.
eng_Latn we will stay together.
eng_Latn that perhaps he was right.
eng_Latn eave us alone for a moment.
eng_Latn he turned his face upon the pillow
eng_Latn he had felt a stirring of tenderness.
eng_Latn he despaired of being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into a deep dejection.
eng_Latn ruining my death!
eng_Latn they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.
eng_Latn We can t find a game to play together. I'm too big to play "Hide And Squeak" in the mouse-hole. And the mice are too little to play Catch-Pug s-Favourite-Ball - look.
eng_Latn I wasn't the only one.
eng_Latn But where do you live? What do youeat? What do you do for fun?
eng_Latn deciphering of those scored parchments which thirty years among men and women had rolled tight in his heart and brain.
eng_Latn I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
eng_Latn I think we have a book that maytake you ART of the bookshop!
eng_Latn the first is that I have made your acquaintance
eng_Latn (chuckling, to camera)
eng_Latn I had a line about my waist
eng_Latn don't let us be in a hurry to condemn him.
eng_Latn sleepy to do much before bed
eng_Latn I proposed that we should all go and eat ices in the park.
eng_Latn I came to see you because I was hoping you could help me.
eng_Latn the fur vanished
eng_Latn my hands came across a light cord
eng_Latn that I was afraid I must have given him some offence.
eng_Latn to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.
eng_Latn when he had found it difficult to believe that
eng_Latn ready to help and cheer all.
eng_Latn gave me just enough money for my journey
eng_Latn he wandered off in the direction of his room
eng_Latn as it was binding upon him in order that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been imposed upon him.
eng_Latn Uhh Thank you for the cricket match Aah.
eng_Latn were little worn and fine.
eng_Latn I'm on a mission, of course!
eng_Latn Now Doris... nice Doris. You can never be a unicorn, but we will let you in our clubhouse.
eng_Latn there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of.
eng_Latn Some more paint?
eng_Latn with his mouth close to her ear.
eng_Latn dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
eng_Latn two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.
eng_Latn he slid sideways on his rain drenched broom
eng_Latn he began to snore.
eng_Latn I could eat this for a week.
eng_Latn I was just old enough to know that it's good to be alone occasionally.
eng_Latn I'm an old man trying to give a young daughter advice
eng_Latn a great gush of energy was being released.
eng_Latn Ah Ah I am..I am . getting much... too much exercisetoday.
eng_Latn though he couldn't suppress a thin lipped smile.
eng_Latn I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my hands.
eng_Latn that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation.
eng_Latn I open my mouth a couple of times to call after him
eng_Latn I old a pistol in my hand!
eng_Latn presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm
eng_Latn making me a sign to step into it
eng_Latn that the commander in chief wished
eng_Latn this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long
eng_Latn it's my birthday
eng_Latn And lots of bright colours thistime please.
eng_Latn that was when he would struggle up from sleep
eng_Latn Spreading it's arms wide.
eng_Latn I think it's so much better to work for refined people than just anybody.
eng_Latn How curious... remarkable...amazing. I love this story.
eng_Latn I put back the receiver.
eng_Latn all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.
eng_Latn My apologies Pug. Are you okay?
eng_Latn I will'but he's a queer man.
eng_Latn I never mean to.
eng_Latn but she had no time at all for it.
eng_Latn there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of.
eng_Latn for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her
eng_Latn I beg pardon for my intrusion
eng_Latn a man with a brown collar, about forty years old, who, at the sound of her step, had quickly escaped through the kitchen.
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and smooth my hair back
eng_Latn with its head upon her breast.
eng_Latn Could you teach me some tricks, Mr Deanie?
eng_Latn one must set one's own fantasy to the violin, and carry one's self to the post.
eng_Latn IN PERFECT PEACE...
eng_Latn so indeed it was
eng_Latn who, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table
eng_Latn I am sorry this has happened
eng_Latn was a thousand times on the point of telling him he lied
eng_Latn she may be constant.
eng_Latn the large boy, backing against the closed door
eng_Latn for some medicine which would bringabout a miscarriage.
eng_Latn upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily
eng_Latn Hello Boys!
eng_Latn How did you sleep?
eng_Latn with anyone you like.
eng_Latn at the time they had been overwhelming.
eng_Latn there are a good many hours between this and to morrow
eng_Latn but at the same instant the man raised his light, which flashed in his face
eng_Latn to one side a great theater lapped up the rock.
eng_Latn I awoke fresh, and recognized our place.
eng_Latn but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation.
eng_Latn in a fascinating but decorous d'shabill'.
eng_Latn but I went away and roared with laughter.
eng_Latn these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life like
eng_Latn he would not have to watch his hair turn gray.
eng_Latn I think that's very unfair,' I said.
eng_Latn getting off the bed.
eng_Latn as though he were going to pick something up.
eng_Latn but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home
eng_Latn I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is better'n you look.
eng_Latn you mustn't go and leave, after all.
eng_Latn but she was too weak to move.
eng_Latn I saw him
eng_Latn when she was done with him
eng_Latn OOO, I like it over here. It's likeover there, but closer.
eng_Latn for ever maybe.
eng_Latn but when I was going to bed at night, asked me if I had got that book?
eng_Latn ...and be sure to tread lightly,because the grass beneath your feet contains an amazing mini-beast world! The end!
eng_Latn would so like to meet you.
eng_Latn Leave that poor baby dragon alone you monster bully!
eng_Latn but when I arrived at his hiding place, he'd gone.
eng_Latn how to walk pigeon toed so that her wide hoop skirts swayed entrancingly
eng_Latn from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.
eng_Latn I'm not Goldilocks - I'm Little RedRiding Hood.
eng_Latn bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate
eng_Latn but he is such a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.
eng_Latn unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men
eng_Latn sometimes there's an inch of silver six words in the bottom of the net.
eng_Latn unless I'm greatly in error.
eng_Latn Then perhaps we could assist eachother in finding our friends.
eng_Latn Where do we go now?
eng_Latn when we came out to the car again I saw his car had been drawn up outside a cafe on the opposite side of the road.
eng_Latn I began to get in a panic about my costume.
eng_Latn she took a few steps after me.
eng_Latn will reach the age of sixteen
eng_Latn If the maze has no exit perhaps THIS is the way out.
eng_Latn I have a totally brilliant idea.
eng_Latn Why is this sound SOOOOOO cool?
eng_Latn I said no
eng_Latn during which his face became pale
eng_Latn but not to any particular one that I knew of.
eng_Latn but of a morose and sour complexion.
eng_Latn have ever since, by association, been symbolical to me of silence and retirement.
eng_Latn we all set on the gallery and had several toddies.
eng_Latn roughened by the wind.
eng_Latn I dart after it.
eng_Latn looking as serious as he could
eng_Latn I should feel well
eng_Latn with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born.
eng_Latn There s no need to hide. It's just my friend, Dog.
eng_Latn I loved it.
eng_Latn I walked off to drink some water at the fountain
eng_Latn the boy, off he went.
eng_Latn but she made him weep with exasperation.
eng_Latn Yip! W-what s that?
eng_Latn telling him somehow that this was his brother
eng_Latn where she left me alone.
eng_Latn can be that I am completely in your power.
eng_Latn she sont me to drive you.
eng_Latn the conversation moved on to cricket.
eng_Latn you have a hole in your shirt.
eng_Latn lit the front gas ring, and put on the coffee.
eng_Latn I ought to know who I am
eng_Latn feeling, with true delicacy
eng_Latn I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.
eng_Latn Someone s in trouble!
eng_Latn That doesn t sound very tranquill- litit-lyty to me Dog.
eng_Latn Then... I will read a book to youinstead.
eng_Latn But which is the right answerGranny Pug?
eng_Latn We canoed down the Nile in a barrel of biscuits. No - that was last week. Oh! We have so many exciting adventures together.
eng_Latn the chemist whistled softly, as he read it.
eng_Latn he had just descended from the upper storey.
eng_Latn turning his ear to the partition
eng_Latn open the door!
eng_Latn especially if one's friends were invariably fit for any function they desired to undertake!
eng_Latn went together into the granary
eng_Latn she asks, voice high and fake innocent.
eng_Latn to leave here as soon as possible.
eng_Latn telling him somehow that this was his brother
eng_Latn the raw smell of hot dust was in the air.
eng_Latn one cannot be completely happy in this world!
eng_Latn I looked round
eng_Latn ask her for the sable cloak.
eng_Latn in order to remember what he had planned.
eng_Latn I sought it and found it.
eng_Latn so I'm not mistaken, as it happens.
eng_Latn be not impatient to answer me
eng_Latn but this beats everything.
eng_Latn what was worse, serious diseases with the symptoms of minor ones.
eng_Latn he held the mastery of them even in his sleep.
eng_Latn I didn't ask her forgiveness.
eng_Latn though he knew the business inside out
eng_Latn for a moment, it felt as though everything was back to normal between them
eng_Latn she said nothing aloud.
eng_Latn entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.
eng_Latn I told her the night she fuss let me sleep in her cellar.
eng_Latn writes the warden's letters and stuff like that.
eng_Latn they are none the less TRUE.
eng_Latn they let me out with a gun in my hand and a free pardon to do more killin'.
eng_Latn I found the treasure.
eng_Latn has never been well since.
eng_Latn however, I escaped pretty well by sticking close to the stem of the tree
eng_Latn Follow me! Pug The Pointy is really good at pointing the way.
eng_Latn don't interrupt me
eng_Latn yet she went on teasing, till he was twice on the point of being provoked to laugh.
eng_Latn I think not sire
eng_Latn that's how I want you to look.
eng_Latn was back again in a few seconds in a frock coat.
eng_Latn it is plain too that
eng_Latn but only as a silent witness.
eng_Latn here is a letter for one of thy officers, if I mistake not.
eng_Latn I turned for a while.
eng_Latn commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself
eng_Latn the light died from his eyes.
eng_Latn indeed, it was soon plain to me that
eng_Latn though I held him at arm's length
eng_Latn my life will be bitter without you.
eng_Latn but her death shocked me terribly.
eng_Latn Quite a lot of both Pug.
eng_Latn but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.
eng_Latn for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter
eng_Latn I no longer understand anything.
eng_Latn even the recollection that there was another will
eng_Latn for how are you to succeed unless love is laid under contribution?
eng_Latn meticulously and very properly.
eng_Latn to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.
eng_Latn then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.
eng_Latn pulling down the bloodsoaked shorts to see blood soaked flesh, shivering.
eng_Latn Ohh Ahh Oh Argh
eng_Latn then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.
eng_Latn but once he learned it he never forgot it
eng_Latn I should be in heels, of course, she says, without stopping.
eng_Latn I didn't look to see who.
eng_Latn not one of which had a trace of scarlet ink on it.
eng_Latn I will fall at his feet and beseech him.
eng_Latn I had to have some help.
eng_Latn for she did not know her in this new mood.
eng_Latn My master is the hero of his own stories. His dreams are impossible but his courage is real.
eng_Latn then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.
eng_Latn two layers of fabric worn through.
eng_Latn there's a haystack
eng_Latn that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it
eng_Latn ...finished at last Dog. And ready for the mice to play on!
eng_Latn it would not be long.
eng_Latn covered with blood
eng_Latn some poor creeter came a beggin', and your ma went straight off to see what was needed.
eng_Latn they all froze when they saw me.
eng_Latn indicating a comfortable chair for him.
eng_Latn who hadnever had a doll in her life, a real doll
eng_Latn but I know what would happen.
eng_Latn I did it all.
eng_Latn that you were 'very nervous' that you asked him whether there were many people over that thatday
eng_Latn squeezing against the gatepost to let the three horses pass.
eng_Latn painted out MANOR FARM from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted ANIMAL FARM.
eng_Latn he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes.
eng_Latn he rejected this foolish idea,
eng_Latn a fiery red thing so enormous that it took two men to lift it.
eng_Latn I crawled up from the floor
eng_Latn now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove.
eng_Latn knew that the student had been shot.
eng_Latn Greetings seekers of tranquillity and calm.
eng_Latn I hadn't seen my wolf in person since that day I'd touched him
eng_Latn I got into a quarrel with a foreman
eng_Latn maybe he was a bit of a mothers boy.
eng_Latn I dare not insist,
eng_Latn I was a merchant
eng_Latn I'll think about her.
eng_Latn it would require two horses.
eng_Latn it was important, therefore, that he should make haste.
eng_Latn that's somepin to you lonely and away.
eng_Latn her mother had come outside to take it right before school started.
eng_Latn I know the last couple days must've been hard for you.
eng_Latn I was very desirous to see
eng_Latn Oh I Thought it was them again.
eng_Latn went for a turn in his garden.
eng_Latn or anywhere else ever again.
eng_Latn I don't know what's gotten into me
eng_Latn never had one moment of happiness together.
eng_Latn I think it wants us to follow it.
eng_Latn his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished,was the one condition'fully intelligible now'that her father had attached to their betrothal
eng_Latn I don t think that s an invitation to a barbecue boys.
eng_Latn maybe I was too late.
eng_Latn I have done all that I could.
eng_Latn when she was young and free in her own house, mistress of her own body.
eng_Latn by means of a little conscript
eng_Latn I smiled at him, and his breathing stuttered.
eng_Latn but this is quite between ourselves.
eng_Latn perhaps we might do better for ourselves with him.
eng_Latn The Emerald Emperor!
eng_Latn I hope she will be better off in one respect
eng_Latn But there s no place like...?
eng_Latn so they put a strait weskut on her and took her to the hospital
eng_Latn Huh huh! Oooh!
eng_Latn for McDougal's cave was
eng_Latn a large amount of mud hit him in the back of the head.
eng_Latn but there was no time to find out.
eng_Latn I was keeping it in case your uncle died before me.
eng_Latn I'm not one for running away from a challenge.
eng_Latn then suddenly fell back on her pillow
eng_Latn the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out
eng_Latn he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one.
eng_Latn I didn't know I should do that.
eng_Latn I need me a grubstake.
eng_Latn And most mysterious of all, theYeti.
eng_Latn I can still hear his voice in my mind.
eng_Latn I too am a man like the rest of you.
eng_Latn a sound a sorrowing man could make, somewhere near this boat.
eng_Latn it's very unbecoming.
eng_Latn I let the car run down the hill slowly.
eng_Latn his mind was prepared for just such an end as did eventually overtake him.
eng_Latn let me ask you
eng_Latn as for a moment their hearts sank in.
eng_Latn entering the yards.
eng_Latn everybody was asleep.
eng_Latn And it is called...
eng_Latn I cherished no malice towards him
eng_Latn I shall be ready for anything.
eng_Latn he seemed to sense it, and pulled his hand reluctantly away.
eng_Latn get the blouses half in large size, half in medium.
eng_Latn presently the waiter brought me my fish.
eng_Latn but to make our own chiefs let us live.
eng_Latn the young wife of an elderly man of fortune here.
eng_Latn she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.
eng_Latn I shook my head vigorously.
eng_Latn that his woman who I also won't name was spending her afternoon sack time with a third party
eng_Latn it cannot be but that the ass will hear us, and answer us if he is in the forest.
eng_Latn Are you an echooo?
eng_Latn he still was after he had married and had children
eng_Latn because he had other things to think of.
eng_Latn we've got lots ter do tomorrow,
eng_Latn I thought you were all dated up.
eng_Latn all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.
eng_Latn his friend was in pursuit of his destiny.
eng_Latn it was nasty!
eng_Latn NO, Dave. Be careful. LOOK OUT!
eng_Latn it belongs to him.
eng_Latn she received an evasive answer.
eng_Latn force some magic out of me
eng_Latn as if she expected to come back tomorrow.
eng_Latn his absence was a relief to me.
eng_Latn they walked on very lovingly together.
eng_Latn will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.
eng_Latn I might return the vessel to her captain.
eng_Latn unless I'm greatly in error.
eng_Latn her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands
eng_Latn his neck was almost completely severed.
eng_Latn I don't think he could
eng_Latn some from her own common sense.
eng_Latn I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping.
eng_Latn but the first charm was gone out of their enjoyment.
eng_Latn if he be but provided with paper and implements, and without his flapper at his side.
eng_Latn biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away
eng_Latn seized a candelabra and dashed it to the ground.
eng_Latn four had made good their footing inside our defences
eng_Latn I turned her gently over
eng_Latn but I am a poor student, and I have my way to make.
eng_Latn a very pleasing young woman.
eng_Latn so her position now is not a rosy one.
eng_Latn I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week.
eng_Latn his hand clenched on his wand.
eng_Latn Thank you Dog and Pug!
eng_Latn we lack the courage to step from our accustomed role
eng_Latn Hello. I am Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn a pair of two egg twin hearts sank and settled on the step above the sixth.
eng_Latn never lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question.
eng_Latn he sat looking fixedly at the questioner.
eng_Latn except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.
eng_Latn threw his hat on the table
eng_Latn there stopped, awaiting instructions.
eng_Latn I remarked laughingly on the change in his present circumstances from those when we had both been medical students.
eng_Latn I must outfit a ship to bring the treasure to the surface.
eng_Latn he touched my face.
eng_Latn I can make a sheep.
eng_Latn auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.
eng_Latn I know we're going to getalong.
eng_Latn that he 'wished he might be busted if he warn't as dry as a lime basket.
eng_Latn Ahh. No, they rolled under the sofa.
eng_Latn I was fairly mad at him.
eng_Latn but, perceiving his error
eng_Latn we are not in a position to do it.
eng_Latn on her wrists she wore some glass beads
eng_Latn but there was no time to find out.
eng_Latn he was much surprised.
eng_Latn threw it wide open as though he were stifling
eng_Latn I have something to tell you.
eng_Latn I felt his soul depart.
eng_Latn nobody would fool around with a preacher anyway.
eng_Latn I call it Hide and Squeak.
eng_Latn yet two had been base born and one had deserted her
eng_Latn when I'm not having laurie.
eng_Latn that you've been in a wrong position altogether
eng_Latn over biscuit and fried junk.
eng_Latn he would never make that mistake again.
eng_Latn over biscuit and fried junk.
eng_Latn a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.
eng_Latn when the occasionpresents itself, we tell the truth about it.
eng_Latn between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment.
eng_Latn you're going out to dinner with a multimillionaire.
eng_Latn her mouth tightened like an overwound spring.
eng_Latn dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was his own property.
eng_Latn Pug we must paint what we see.
eng_Latn I know I love you.
eng_Latn attempts to write poetry.
eng_Latn that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer.
eng_Latn fumbling about him for his cane
eng_Latn I should feel well
eng_Latn he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead
eng_Latn then who wants to be mutilated?
eng_Latn the parcel gave a strange quiver
eng_Latn I have no doubt she did.
eng_Latn then my blood crept cold through my veins.
eng_Latn although he must be miserable without them.
eng_Latn but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days.
eng_Latn no need to go through less hospitable channels.
eng_Latn there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him
eng_Latn waited patiently for him to spy her.
eng_Latn he's in the forest
eng_Latn when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten
eng_Latn then, all because of him, came the other gentleman and carried off my tail
eng_Latn It's pandemonium. How curious.
eng_Latn there was always the other great dread
eng_Latn I don't mean confessing.
eng_Latn Which is what I am writing today!
eng_Latn the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost
eng_Latn auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.
eng_Latn went straight to his bench and to work.
eng_Latn I was hoping to hear a bit of it.
eng_Latn I fell asleep to the scent of my wolf.
eng_Latn about how I couldn't use it for three months
eng_Latn And the eyes that never look at anyone kindly.
eng_Latn I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither!
eng_Latn get behind the door
eng_Latn when he saw my drawing he just raised his eyebrows and walked on.
eng_Latn the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow, made off across the plain
eng_Latn Okay! Huray!
eng_Latn squirted boiling tea all over the place
eng_Latn Follow me chums!
eng_Latn I was too thirsty.
eng_Latn I certainly believe his master's defeat unhinged him for a while.
eng_Latn but I thought it was due to a very natural jealousy rather than to maternal solicitude.
eng_Latn smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings
eng_Latn I could teach him more.
eng_Latn the old scamp will be condemned.
eng_Latn thence upon the leads and gutters
eng_Latn It's a snail Pug.
eng_Latn I got home just after the others had left for school.
eng_Latn any more than the rising sun had rays.
eng_Latn leaving the shape of my fingers carved into the remaining wood.
eng_Latn biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away
eng_Latn a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be.
eng_Latn I determined to go up and see for myself.
eng_Latn brought his buckler before his breast
eng_Latn wiping he waited.
eng_Latn but he held her back.
eng_Latn Here. Take this...
eng_Latn he was a widower
eng_Latn you all would stick around for a while and he would have a chance to get to know her.
eng_Latn Umm Briny Barnacles ... Curious Camels. Aah.. Audacious Animals!
eng_Latn I'm quite comfortable.
eng_Latn Isn t it traditional for dogs to do the chasing?
eng_Latn then something seemed to go all over me, you know
eng_Latn I had weary days of it.
eng_Latn (CHUCKLING) Only Granny! But we still had an amazing adventure.
eng_Latn obviously anxious to be taken seriously by a girl like herself, as she could see.
eng_Latn as to urge no influence against me.
eng_Latn I'm Bigger Digger. I can lift more,carry more and go further on my mighty wheels.
eng_Latn I was set upon at once as a hated aristocrat
eng_Latn I'd been expecting it to be difficult.
eng_Latn a man who does not even know how to carry his breeding.
eng_Latn I see him from time to time.
eng_Latn it gets too complicated otherwise.
eng_Latn that you are not!
eng_Latn for he soon found they wanted a genius to enter into the spirit of a poet.
eng_Latn I wish I could explain it to you right so that you would understand.
eng_Latn I wish he hadn't.
eng_Latn the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat
eng_Latn his eyes went quietly around the circle of faces.
eng_Latn but you need more than a nice guy.
eng_Latn A great place to bury a bone?
eng_Latn he said, raising his hat
eng_Latn soon got upon firm ground
eng_Latn the other two fled with their tails between their legs.
eng_Latn that you intend breakfasting with me
eng_Latn as incredulous of my sanity.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book that will help you remember your sleepy time rhyme?
eng_Latn but this beats everything.
eng_Latn you sometimes have to join forces with those you'd rather avoid.
eng_Latn I've got a beastly appointment.
eng_Latn he had not moved.
eng_Latn Wow, things are so well hidden inthe forest. How are we ever going to find Camille?
eng_Latn I d much rather have an electric light ... or my trusty head torch!
eng_Latn he declared his belief that there was somebody else besides themselves upon the lighter.
eng_Latn the evil for him who goes to look for it
eng_Latn I'll have to look elsewhere for allies.
eng_Latn broke through a group of boys
eng_Latn with his elbows raised squarely, he twisted both ends of his flaming moustaches
eng_Latn you needn't fear.
eng_Latn based not so much on kinship as on complicity.
eng_Latn unless indeed it be that the victor have lost his own in the combat
eng_Latn I'd better find some food for you, he said in a quiet voice, and he gently unwound my arms.
eng_Latn My plan didn t really work Dog.
eng_Latn I read the note
eng_Latn I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.
eng_Latn one, on the staircase at dawn.
eng_Latn tied it to the other side of his collar like reins over his neck
eng_Latn I tried to feel my heart, to find it
eng_Latn I don' wanna go back there no more'I'm tar'd.
eng_Latn after almost two years of crossing
eng_Latn LESS TALKING. MORE ROWING!
eng_Latn resuming her work
eng_Latn I had to get some string.
eng_Latn had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who
eng_Latn What do you make OF THIS?
eng_Latn he never rests till blue water is under him again.
eng_Latn I feared now to hear my own story.
eng_Latn I lose my temper on the slightest provocation, flare up, and then it's all over.
eng_Latn I tried again.
eng_Latn I ask just one thing of you, cousin, she went on
eng_Latn I set down one time back in the woods
eng_Latn that I didn't come home to dinner.
eng_Latn swerved to hit it.
eng_Latn but it was not of his own seeking.
eng_Latn I have but exchanged with him one look, yet that look convinced me that we were doomed.
eng_Latn it was like a fresh slap in the face.
eng_Latn he never encouraged me, you know.
eng_Latn but before you go you will be pleased just to answer me a question or two.
eng_Latn so that thou repent not of what thou hast done
eng_Latn I am in no fear of you.
eng_Latn a chance current had sent it alighting on her.
eng_Latn _you_, of your own will, did it.
eng_Latn its dark high corridors awash with quietness and a tangible holiness.
eng_Latn but he hadn't come back all the way and he wouldn't talk about what had happened.
eng_Latn again began walking up and down the room.
eng_Latn had come home.
eng_Latn Dog, we must rush to the rescue!
eng_Latn An oak leaf is perfect Pug, andyou can use it as a shield.
eng_Latn revealed the crime, and,finally
eng_Latn I stood alone beside the body when death came over it.
eng_Latn ask about some socks.
eng_Latn found there a stoutish, middle aged person
eng_Latn in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt.
eng_Latn shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
eng_Latn What brings you to the North Pole Granny Pug?
eng_Latn for the carrier still lay senseless
eng_Latn And Doris the donkey never wantedto be a unicorn again, because just by being herself, she could be so much more.
eng_Latn they took it as a joke.
eng_Latn I could not find one.
eng_Latn Let's hit the road!
eng_Latn she sat down
eng_Latn sit down, prince, near the fire and talk to us.
eng_Latn I brought him a mug
eng_Latn unbolt the side passage door
eng_Latn I b'lieve the nigger was crazy.
eng_Latn I was quite out of breath with running and calling after him
eng_Latn he would move the captains to take some pity on us.
eng_Latn the scheme to return home with his brother pirates
eng_Latn as the fellow may put out his light and be off.
eng_Latn when he should again interrogate her
eng_Latn reached for the sugar bowl
eng_Latn I was therefore forced to hold my peace.
eng_Latn laying a soiled and unopened letter before him
eng_Latn shark is only one syllable.
eng_Latn I was so sure that my wolf had been there.
eng_Latn Let me paint a portrait of you and show you how it's done.
eng_Latn having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities.
eng_Latn Oooh! (panting)
eng_Latn I didn't look to see who.
eng_Latn thinking to himself
eng_Latn so he smuggled out some hundred dollar plates that were supposed to have been destroyed
eng_Latn I ate it before it could be measured.
eng_Latn which knocked him backward onto the floor.
eng_Latn he found a wounded panther
eng_Latn my servant's coat and my hat?
eng_Latn for a last look at the house.
eng_Latn when I heard
eng_Latn What a noisy place Pug.
eng_Latn I'd slept through the rest of the day and the whole night
eng_Latn that is so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.
eng_Latn This is a story about someone who liked something very much indeed. And it is called...
eng_Latn And here s a nice mug of tea andsome even nicer doggy biscuits.
eng_Latn I don't like to see you quarrelling.
eng_Latn SURPRISE!
eng_Latn my principal object was to make your acquaintance.
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all...
eng_Latn not like the other one.
eng_Latn I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin
eng_Latn thank you for not using greater severity.
eng_Latn feeling, with true delicacy
eng_Latn but not for long
eng_Latn hold our breath
eng_Latn stared at the ground.
eng_Latn I clutched at the pommel, and found my damaged arm there and efficient.
eng_Latn he tightened his grasp upon my hand
eng_Latn when he came home tonight and she had him alone, she would certainly tell him so.
eng_Latn I can't see him anywhere.
eng_Latn then remembered it hadn't been working since it had spent over an hour in the lake.
eng_Latn I got here. I made it.
eng_Latn stared at the ground.
eng_Latn he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.
eng_Latn as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief
eng_Latn I didn't see anything either
eng_Latn Oooo!
eng_Latn my residence in that locality had already grown dim and dreamy.
eng_Latn dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.
eng_Latn she paused to lean against a tree that was there her nervous and physical strength all but failing her.
eng_Latn while he on his side promised not to undertake anything without his parents' knowledge.
eng_Latn when he had found it difficult to believe that
eng_Latn perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive
eng_Latn he decided to deny themotion.
eng_Latn but in a minute I see I was mistaken
eng_Latn I made us all late
eng_Latn Don t be glum. Perhaps we have a book in the shop that could help you with your see-saw flaw?
eng_Latn except that she was so headstrong.
eng_Latn Just imagine something and then see it on the paper.
eng_Latn feeling, with true delicacy
eng_Latn not like the other one.
eng_Latn he had been ushered into the drawing room
eng_Latn I was not able to work.
eng_Latn took up his hat, as if to go.
eng_Latn And very, very slowly like George the koala!
eng_Latn his wavy hair was standing on end
eng_Latn to try if it came up to my own opinion of it
eng_Latn I took both her cold hands in mine, rubbing them carefully.
eng_Latn as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.
eng_Latn I watched them walk down the hill and disappear behind a wall.
eng_Latn the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics
eng_Latn I will fall at his feet and beseech him.
eng_Latn I must observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.
eng_Latn a man with a brown collar, about forty years old, who, at the sound of her step, had quickly escaped through the kitchen.
eng_Latn but you have only to search for yourself
eng_Latn not bothering to shut the door.
eng_Latn maybe you've heard?
eng_Latn for a mule trader who did not know how to read or write
eng_Latn till this moment I've been afraid to ask you, you, even you.
eng_Latn he ordered me to return it into the scabbard.
eng_Latn to dream on
eng_Latn dearer to me than any blood sister could ever be.
eng_Latn but the task he had begun had to be completed.
eng_Latn clearer than the water.
eng_Latn hoping to catch the sound ofhis voice
eng_Latn I'm not going to be chewed out again.
eng_Latn the cabbie poked his nose through the screen into the rear compartment.
eng_Latn I got places to go.
eng_Latn I explained to her that I had no parents.
eng_Latn get behind the door
eng_Latn my heat has melted thee to anger glow.
eng_Latn I took leave.
eng_Latn I couldn't do that.
eng_Latn covered with blood
eng_Latn but her smile seemed studied.
eng_Latn Hmmm!
eng_Latn Teach Yourself Marvels.
eng_Latn as if it knew it was perfectly safe.
eng_Latn death by the hands of the mutineers.
eng_Latn but I know what would happen.
eng_Latn since I have you to help me.
eng_Latn today, to believe that the past is unalterable.
eng_Latn And brave.
eng_Latn the corpse placed on it
eng_Latn her father had changed so much that
eng_Latn WHAT WE TEACH YOUHow to address your lodge.
eng_Latn to have both hands as free as possible.
eng_Latn I push my hair back off my face.
eng_Latn I took no notice
eng_Latn but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the sea is so to him
eng_Latn Story Two. A Race Through Space. Ever onwards into the unknown galaxy went the cosmic explorers...
eng_Latn in the slow dragging ages
eng_Latn I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.
eng_Latn begin his life as an outcast.
eng_Latn replaced by neat green fields
eng_Latn for any body else who would be puzzled.
eng_Latn I come to a halt as I hear a sound.
eng_Latn I enjoyed it much.
eng_Latn if his music was good it would speak for itself.
eng_Latn I was so afraid I should have to go away without seeing you again!
eng_Latn That s it then. We ve lost it.
eng_Latn This waffle maker is also a robot.
eng_Latn the fur vanished
eng_Latn swallowing a glass of brandy
eng_Latn was so daring and such a villain
eng_Latn as she would have done.
eng_Latn it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the conditionof man.
eng_Latn I shoved my foot down on the accelerator again.
eng_Latn shipped to his new land free of charge
eng_Latn as soon as you had finished dressing.
eng_Latn there's anything to do
eng_Latn I assure you I was,' she returned.
eng_Latn or because someone made him?
eng_Latn see if any of you have begun to learn to spell.
eng_Latn my child is there!
eng_Latn only his face is visible now.
eng_Latn claimed that all his property descended to them.
eng_Latn I rejoiced at his insistence
eng_Latn the stream descending the ravine
eng_Latn Oh no, there s woe.
eng_Latn itting on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his saintliness.
eng_Latn but which now assumed the garb of reality
eng_Latn It belongs with this yellow page four.
eng_Latn you only told us
eng_Latn it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone.
eng_Latn but it so happened that the boy one day succeeded in giving the proud maiden a surprise.
eng_Latn I reflected for a minute or two.
eng_Latn had almost dropped asleep
eng_Latn she would never tolerate the idea of having a woman in to help with the housework.
eng_Latn the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
eng_Latn I must express my view of it and my decision.
eng_Latn we turned our attention to our voyage
eng_Latn she let it pass because it was pleasing to her.
eng_Latn for to gain you would be life to me
eng_Latn that all the women should retire to the garret that has been already mentioned
eng_Latn I trusted you.
eng_Latn what a disgrace upon the house!
eng_Latn I had to work.
eng_Latn truly magnanimous man, your very humble and very obedient servant
eng_Latn in the car you weren't intending to fly!
eng_Latn he must be a great criminal
eng_Latn your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities
eng_Latn to be noticed and admired.
eng_Latn but when the wedding days were over
eng_Latn all by the advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject.
eng_Latn sinking to his knees in the muddy field
eng_Latn my fault! shameful, unpardonable!
eng_Latn I am not exactly thanking you
eng_Latn I replied that she would not be harmed.
eng_Latn Pug, I think I know the rest of your sleepy time rhyme now.
eng_Latn so he at once gave him a drubbing
eng_Latn from between the backs of those in front
eng_Latn he had never dared show it even to his mother
eng_Latn he believed that, should a woman be so unfortunate as to have such unladylike comprehension, she should pretend not to.
eng_Latn I should have been continually at fault.
eng_Latn I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel.
eng_Latn that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.
eng_Latn I love a book that takes me to the moon and back.
eng_Latn but he still had to duck
eng_Latn I haven't seen him all day.
eng_Latn everything else will come right of itself.
eng_Latn where did you get it
eng_Latn writes the warden's letters and stuff like that.
eng_Latn but it was not his tractor.
eng_Latn she's off hunting at the moment.
eng_Latn my child is there!
eng_Latn but I have little time for reading.
eng_Latn Now the bookshop mice are asking Why a lot too - again!
eng_Latn he must wake up!
eng_Latn I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble
eng_Latn I have the misfortune, to have been deceived in my married life,
eng_Latn kept her hand drawn through his arm.
eng_Latn that it was much distorted and discoloured.
eng_Latn then who wants to be mutilated?
eng_Latn there was a burst of green light
eng_Latn boundlessly grateful to the red haired man
eng_Latn all by the advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject.
eng_Latn he came to me.
eng_Latn I haven't nowt in all the wureld that ain't yourn, my dear.
eng_Latn besides, the appearance and disappearance ofLouis XVIII.
eng_Latn the doctor said, with a roughness of tone intended to hide the sinking of his heart and the faltering of his voice.
eng_Latn I'm very disappointed in you.
eng_Latn but make haste and get married, and make everything as it used to be again.
eng_Latn he put the bark hastily in his pocket.
eng_Latn even when she touched him and listened for his breathing, she could not trust her conclusions.
eng_Latn waiting for him to get it clear in his head, so he can explain it to me in simple terms.
eng_Latn but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mend her
eng_Latn but of a morose and sour complexion.
eng_Latn the divine goodness of her smile of compassion.
eng_Latn he listened in gloomy silence.
eng_Latn I tried to feel my heart, to find it
eng_Latn but now she could not force herself to think of her.
eng_Latn No! No! No! No! No!
eng_Latn held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison.
eng_Latn I am incapable of doing so, he said.
eng_Latn I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door
eng_Latn that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way
eng_Latn I'll kill him.
eng_Latn I just'let her carry on a bit.
eng_Latn she memorized what he had said
eng_Latn without choosing or discussing anything.
eng_Latn was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
eng_Latn Although it didn t show me how to build a machine to move my big pile of books.
eng_Latn when she was young and free in her own house, mistress of her own body.
eng_Latn their reflections were so close together
eng_Latn if anyone knew the reason for the suicide.
eng_Latn Long had the brave knights been on a quest to find King Arthur s crown...
eng_Latn I'd go dump it under a tree or something.
eng_Latn I wish we'd travelled back another few days.
eng_Latn flinging herself into a chair
eng_Latn his burden was heavy at the best of times.
eng_Latn because it was sour
eng_Latn e, who is under some obligation to me
eng_Latn I don't disagree with you there.
eng_Latn if it be accompanied by practice.
eng_Latn the truth is unhappily hardly ever amusing.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer!
eng_Latn that his brother in law had proposed to her and been refused.
eng_Latn but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself
eng_Latn that if he the landlord really had no other place for me
eng_Latn they were quite alike in this.
eng_Latn yet when she put her arms around him she could sense a faint echo of some intensity quite missing in the others.
eng_Latn there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker
eng_Latn I know you need not
eng_Latn we were before the serasker
eng_Latn I'll stay to dinner if you like, or stop the night.
eng_Latn but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way.
eng_Latn I love the... (Teeth chatter) Pug, is it very cold in the shop today?
eng_Latn let's go drink a bottle of old wine together.
eng_Latn I just locked the keys in the car.
eng_Latn found there a stoutish, middle aged person
eng_Latn The one where the animals take over the farm?
eng_Latn I'm simply unhappy.
eng_Latn for both were idly smiling.
eng_Latn but the blood had dried just one lock into a stiff cowlick.
eng_Latn I'd deflected him from his path
eng_Latn they set off immediately as fast as they could walk, in pursuit of the two young men.
eng_Latn as he was pleased to call it.
eng_Latn Then it should be. I'm not a king.I'm just a gallery of silly pictures that I think will make people respect me. But now I see how others see me... I want to change.
eng_Latn as he was an extremely interesting person from various points of view, and likely to be useful.
eng_Latn I suppressed a sigh.
eng_Latn she made her stay in bed for five days and
eng_Latn he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.
eng_Latn I must think what to do.
eng_Latn they must go softly
eng_Latn I shall be quite well to morrow.
eng_Latn I hope I shan't have to go any further.
eng_Latn will, produce before you substantiations of every one of them.
eng_Latn replied the father, I am much colder than that.
eng_Latn with seven or eight red hairs like threads of gold, and more than a palm long.
eng_Latn was reading the news of that city
eng_Latn she had no ear
eng_Latn for it is bitter cold.
eng_Latn I learned that much at sea.
eng_Latn she had made up her mind to rent it.
eng_Latn but I shall refuse.
eng_Latn You say you are going to divide avery tall dog in half, then put him back together again.
eng_Latn I should like to tell you, dear friends, of that youth, my brother
eng_Latn that was his style
eng_Latn law is law.
eng_Latn putting the boy in his charge
eng_Latn implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.
eng_Latn It's a good job I ve been learning how to surf in my basement!
eng_Latn Treasure! Treasure! Where be me treasure? As sure as my name is Two-Beards The Pirate I wants me treasure!
eng_Latn I will need feeding in the night.
eng_Latn just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him
eng_Latn you don't seem to care much.
eng_Latn to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives.
eng_Latn but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father's breast
eng_Latn that you are not!
eng_Latn deep inside some fold or furrow
eng_Latn I was cook in.
eng_Latn Isn t it very, VERY cold at The South Pole Pug?
eng_Latn my steward transacts all this business for me
eng_Latn I had a good time tonight.
eng_Latn when I was five years old
eng_Latn snapping open her black silk fan to its widest.
eng_Latn for in truth you are to blame for their not wanting to hear you.
eng_Latn I was starting to wonder where you'd gotten off to.
eng_Latn No you couldn t, it's tiny.
eng_Latn we had got so far out of the run of the current
eng_Latn has not since been heard of.
eng_Latn I hope that you didn't do anything illegal
eng_Latn you are beating on my brain
eng_Latn Like something was watching me!
eng_Latn it will cheer us up do now no ceremony!
eng_Latn I didn't hear the rising bell this morning
eng_Latn don't interrupt me
eng_Latn who hadnever had a doll in her life, a real doll
eng_Latn stroked his mustache
eng_Latn to repair his farm implements
eng_Latn but not once of the impending danger.
eng_Latn I think I can kick it open if yousay so.
eng_Latn I instantly recognized
eng_Latn by whom they were entertained and treated like kings.
eng_Latn I came through.
eng_Latn circle of fifteen of them packed together around me
eng_Latn that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA.
eng_Latn he resolutely entered the church.
eng_Latn Don Quixote and The Windmills.
eng_Latn I can t wait to see what I looked like back in the day!
eng_Latn I'm quite comfortable.
eng_Latn I got to have it to night.
eng_Latn especially on the innate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the strength of the gander.
eng_Latn I thought you said you were the chief?
eng_Latn he pointed to a chubby boy with curly hair
eng_Latn one who was truly beginning to know women.
eng_Latn he he insulted me.
eng_Latn that man's dead.
eng_Latn without choosing or discussing anything.
eng_Latn tried to speak to him
eng_Latn then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.
eng_Latn that sixlight infantry men of the 1st, having made their way thither
eng_Latn she let her work rest on her lap
eng_Latn but I can't allow the inmates to run this prison.
eng_Latn who was still smiling even when they untied him from the post
eng_Latn but I positively haven't another moment now.
eng_Latn however, just as you like.
eng_Latn I'd gone seven decades without human blood.
eng_Latn I'm afraid I am late for an engagement.
eng_Latn then you will know the happiness of forgiving.
eng_Latn to describe the state of mind in which she hadapproached him
eng_Latn carrying her coffee and her toast with her as she did every day
eng_Latn I mean the poverty, and abandoning her position.
eng_Latn I just threw it down there.
eng_Latn here is a letter for one of thy officers, if I mistake not.
eng_Latn I stared into his eyes and heard my own voice for the first time.
eng_Latn silence on both sides.
eng_Latn but remember
eng_Latn it must've been really bad
eng_Latn the yellow speck of light burning steadily in front.
eng_Latn but at the colonel's clamour it was produced quickly enough, a corporal bringing it up, carried carefully in the palms of his joined hands.
eng_Latn who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole
eng_Latn let me ask you
eng_Latn laying sheepskins on the ground
eng_Latn who had perished from hunger.
eng_Latn I felt a little bit heavy hearted about the gang
eng_Latn I kept my voice light.
eng_Latn then, leaning with one hand on the oaken rail of the dock
eng_Latn then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again.
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder Pug.
eng_Latn but finding it impossible
eng_Latn but he got in some good swipes before we were out of his reach.
eng_Latn thinking to himself
eng_Latn the young man who had questioned him.
eng_Latn so I made some stuff up.
eng_Latn with some arsenic she had stealthily procured.
eng_Latn it seemed to himthat what he had just said was really true.
eng_Latn do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now preparing to invade us.
eng_Latn I mean real fighting.
eng_Latn made her sit down on the bed.
eng_Latn Once upon the seven seas there sailed a sailing ship - and do you know who was on that ship?
eng_Latn its dark high corridors awash with quietness and a tangible holiness.
eng_Latn she saw a man coming along the hall.
eng_Latn choking itself in the collar.
eng_Latn Neither have I Dog. That s why Imade it up.
eng_Latn I listened, too engrossed, to the girl's response.
eng_Latn I wonder if I could come and see you?
eng_Latn I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed.
eng_Latn I told your daughter that she is like a rose.
eng_Latn I was set upon at once as a hated aristocrat
eng_Latn Uh... Mr Picanoso. I really think you should put down that accordion and get back to the old painting lark.
eng_Latn that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer.
eng_Latn getting off the bed.
eng_Latn he would never make that mistake again.
eng_Latn from the indulgence of our passions, and
eng_Latn I decided to go overthere.
eng_Latn her broken leg in its cast stuck out stiffly in front of her.
eng_Latn my principal object was to make your acquaintance.
eng_Latn he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.
eng_Latn she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be.
eng_Latn of a sudden, I began to comprehend.
eng_Latn to invent an easy justification for his surrender.
eng_Latn to this old lady, a cette pauvre terrible vieille.
eng_Latn that's good and beheaded
eng_Latn I beseech you to let me bring him here.
eng_Latn I don't think you meant to kill anyone.
eng_Latn till they were lost in the distance.
eng_Latn I lied to him and I married him.
eng_Latn who wouldn't let me kiss her when I offered to, but ran away and hid herself.
eng_Latn I could have been.
eng_Latn My doggy biscuit soup is too hot to eat!
eng_Latn flapped the reins.
eng_Latn something that was too impenetrable for ultrasounds, too tough for needles.
eng_Latn but git your things ready right away, mum,
eng_Latn we'll set the candle on the stairs.
eng_Latn he was contented to take half the usual rate
eng_Latn Hello. I'm not Dog anymore. I'm a man.
eng_Latn then pushed the paper a little way from him
eng_Latn maybe I was too late.
eng_Latn asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy, remained standing beside her.
eng_Latn whether she will return to her husband
eng_Latn to my infinite terror,
eng_Latn He He Hee. Ha Haa Hah.Wooo
eng_Latn I had not the smallest indication on which to let my imagination work.
eng_Latn but, if you will persist
eng_Latn to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast,
eng_Latn realized with a shock that he was an old man
eng_Latn I needed was some food and a little rest.
eng_Latn then a deep, sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.
eng_Latn the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly alike
eng_Latn you have taken to working without pay.
eng_Latn at the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of
eng_Latn the mysterious chain that links one thing to another,
eng_Latn but he would not suffer her to put him on the same level with them.
eng_Latn she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be.
eng_Latn I I just couldn't have gone through all this without you.
eng_Latn a leat her knee cap, whence hung a moderately large bell.
eng_Latn I hate fainting in front of a roomful of men.
eng_Latn wrapped herself up, without opening her lips.
eng_Latn he had contrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one of his characteristics
eng_Latn he leaned over her.
eng_Latn stay out till two and not do any explainingafterwards.
eng_Latn I wisht I could wait an' not tell you.
eng_Latn he went panting into the confused and gloomy place where there was barely room to move.
eng_Latn giving them the tufted look of a lynx's ears.
eng_Latn some of it had gone the wrong way.
eng_Latn to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure.
eng_Latn Huh Oh crumbs.
eng_Latn offered to give him typing lessons at home.
eng_Latn at night they locked their doors in fear and dread.
eng_Latn like they had for the last three nights.
eng_Latn ...I love a pile of books so old I have to carry them very carefully or they might....
eng_Latn Yes. But you can t play cricket onyour own.
eng_Latn he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity.
eng_Latn a most important personage!
eng_Latn I hate maroon
eng_Latn that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame
eng_Latn I never was whipped in school.
eng_Latn that no doubt now remained in the young girl's mind
eng_Latn you have seen enough of it.
eng_Latn perhaps he exaggerated.
eng_Latn my principal object was to make your acquaintance.
eng_Latn but he could read people like a book.
eng_Latn he sank into a chair
eng_Latn slapped her left hand on its biceps in a fascinating
eng_Latn driving him back and standing in his place.
eng_Latn the abandonment of all those who loved me
eng_Latn bore his drinking better than others bore their moderation
eng_Latn I can still hear his voice in my mind.
eng_Latn as for the men
eng_Latn pale dolphin body dipped down to the bottom of the fragrant water.
eng_Latn forward looking out for the island.
eng_Latn What do you say, Pug?
eng_Latn I can't move in with you.
eng_Latn the crew began to man the capstan bars.
eng_Latn pull you down with him.
eng_Latn she's sorry she ever came home, I daresay!
eng_Latn I think I know who that one's from
eng_Latn to go and fetch my child!
eng_Latn I felt a moment of unease.
eng_Latn But this time I ll hide and you can hunt me!
eng_Latn I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me.
eng_Latn Ah. Now it makes perfect sense.
eng_Latn then something seemed to go all over me, you know
eng_Latn he has become intensely interested in looking after it.
eng_Latn I grabbed a horse
eng_Latn but nothing happened.
eng_Latn Was I asleepagain? I do apologise. I spend so much time getting the children to sleep, I never get any sleep time for me.
eng_Latn who have chosen that career, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side.
eng_Latn one who was truly beginning to know women.
eng_Latn to hear the old fashioned airs he liked.
eng_Latn she acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look.
eng_Latn that event was what he had decided to arrange.
eng_Latn they hastily fed him treacle fudge from a tin on the mantelpiece
eng_Latn he had a very indefinite notion of what it consisted in
eng_Latn like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
eng_Latn I looked round
eng_Latn Dog, how did everything begin?
eng_Latn who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license.
eng_Latn I read it on the train coming here
eng_Latn we ought even to add that, among the curiositiesdisplayed in the square
eng_Latn then they raise hell an' figger he been killed.
eng_Latn Is that why you are wearing yoursuper-hero mask Pug?
eng_Latn she watched from between her knees.
eng_Latn it had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries.
eng_Latn I asked, my voice a little too curious.
eng_Latn he finished, smiling more broadly than ever.
eng_Latn I lit a cigarette to give myself a moment's time.
eng_Latn I grab my jacket and almost run out of the office
eng_Latn encountered the face of his interesting consort
eng_Latn she found the tracks of a biped with a cloven hoof.
eng_Latn showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy eyebrows
eng_Latn But I didn t listen because they were tiny.
eng_Latn but I never knew its significance before.
eng_Latn there were other people on hand to share her triumph.
eng_Latn perspiring and flurried, she fell at his feet the moment she saw him.
eng_Latn Happy Doggy Biscuit Day Pug!
eng_Latn had to submit to the realities of a new time
eng_Latn but there was no need to tell her yet.
eng_Latn she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw, of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers.
eng_Latn they had almost ruined their health.
eng_Latn I'd turn into a screaming shrew and we'd end up hating each other.
eng_Latn these last two years somiserably between these crushing walls.
eng_Latn partly because he liked it best
eng_Latn a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads
eng_Latn the feast'll be starting in five minutes.
eng_Latn when he had concluded.
eng_Latn Over there, Mr Big Bad Wolf. Thereare pigs and lots of blankets in that house.
eng_Latn tucking her free arm in his.
eng_Latn it was the smell of gas.
eng_Latn it broke off suddenly in mid air
eng_Latn I shut off the engine and got out.
eng_Latn where he will be staying for the next three days.
eng_Latn but that two egg twins were no different from ordinary siblings
eng_Latn to go here and there without the expenditure of any money.
eng_Latn I learned long ago not to take any notice of love sick girls.
eng_Latn weeping and praying
eng_Latn ask her for the sable cloak.
eng_Latn I hope she calls later.
eng_Latn he cried, and rapidly jumping up, he drew back, so that he knocked his back against the wall and stood up against it, stiff and straight.
eng_Latn he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you.
eng_Latn Greetings seekers of the off the charts and under the radar . Let Granny Pug be your guide on a voyage of discovery and deep, uncharted oceans -
eng_Latn who, also transformed by his uniform
eng_Latn as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing on the counter.
eng_Latn I left a basket of clothes on the porch.
eng_Latn it was only a matter of time before I caught him.
eng_Latn a tall, gangling, but very smartly dressed individual.
eng_Latn that you should surrender and confess.
eng_Latn by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.
eng_Latn you surprised me, my friend you did, indeed.
eng_Latn placing his hand on the young man's shoulder.
eng_Latn he had risen from bed with great difficulty
eng_Latn I didn't even really understand how being shot had given me back my human form in this cool weather.
eng_Latn The end.
eng_Latn I asked leave to teach myself
eng_Latn I wisht you could a heerd me sing.
eng_Latn Then goodbye.
eng_Latn a lock of her baby's hair and a withered leaf from her father's grave.
eng_Latn with a sound mind.
eng_Latn I smell an adventure Pug. Let us explore beyond this door.
eng_Latn Thank you Dog and Pug. We are now most amused!
eng_Latn which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of courage
eng_Latn your gesture, your movement
eng_Latn I am not exactly thanking you
eng_Latn propped themselves on their elbows to talk.
eng_Latn it was not such a hollow world at all.
eng_Latn she saw a man coming along the hall.
eng_Latn You need to keep your recipe booksomewhere the mice will never find it.
eng_Latn the count, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.
eng_Latn How did it get there? Where did it come from?
eng_Latn we were out of his reach.
eng_Latn that we may have surer ground to go on
eng_Latn I never was more glad to see anyone in my life
eng_Latn but recovered very soon
eng_Latn we shall see the triumph.
eng_Latn (CHUCKLING) I don t think you re the only one looking forward to some sunshine today Pug.
eng_Latn I can do nothing.' he would commonly cry in such cases.
eng_Latn just a small change in the set of my mouth.
eng_Latn I hain't been gone anywheres.
eng_Latn so of what she had said they only noticed, and repeated in a whisper
eng_Latn stickin' out like a tooth.
eng_Latn if you look around, I'm sure you'll find various poisons in the house.
eng_Latn I found both the brothers intent upon me.
eng_Latn for what thou hast told me has amazed me
eng_Latn wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing it.
eng_Latn I have no faith in misanthropes.
eng_Latn What? But...
eng_Latn but after dinner called the count aside
eng_Latn a very pleasing young woman.
eng_Latn if it did not terminate as she wished.
eng_Latn as being the dupes of a wily fraud
eng_Latn when everyone was just confused and scared?
eng_Latn I haven't heard a word from him since he was here.
eng_Latn all day long she waited for him to come.
eng_Latn glad of the chance to be alone with him.
eng_Latn so that he spilled his coffee.
eng_Latn for a light was burning there.
eng_Latn I'm ignorant of it!
eng_Latn going upon deck.
eng_Latn was in another department.
eng_Latn leaned on his elbows
eng_Latn to sign the contract
eng_Latn I reminded him.
eng_Latn their children grown and well behaved
eng_Latn I explained to her that I had no parents.
eng_Latn but I prevented him, and he is just waiting for me to go away.
eng_Latn he passed several as being too crowded
eng_Latn he was fearful of his entire connection with thisill fated trip
eng_Latn Let me take a turn Pug.
eng_Latn as clyde entered, leaning and craning and examining himwith sharp keen eyes
eng_Latn he would not forgive her his disgrace.
eng_Latn it's just been such a shock.
eng_Latn Because that s how old you are in dog years of course! Now blow them out.
eng_Latn except to blow a loud wet raspberry.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book... although it could have had a better prize.
eng_Latn And it showed you how to make yourpyramid model perfect.
eng_Latn began another laugh.
eng_Latn I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.
eng_Latn but it was she.
eng_Latn for this defence and vengeance are his affair and business.
eng_Latn Nobody knows for certain where the castle of Camelot lies. But this fabled fortress, was once the home of King Arthur and his knights
eng_Latn a bit of love from someone!
eng_Latn that he twisted his left ankle, fell backward
eng_Latn I shut off the engine and got out.
eng_Latn I believe he is a free mason.
eng_Latn when she sets herself to press a point
eng_Latn the rice fields have gone back to marsh lands.
eng_Latn I assure you she did.
eng_Latn encumbered by his baggage and transport
eng_Latn but once he learned it he never forgot it
eng_Latn though I had already come to the same conclusions from my own observations.
eng_Latn but I awoke next morning after nine o'clock when they knocked at my door.
eng_Latn white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, covered to the waist by a bright green quilt
eng_Latn as if the self confidence of the gathering had been staggered by a blow.
eng_Latn I couldn't see.
eng_Latn I hate estimable young men with brown eyes!
eng_Latn for I tried it myself after hearing the suggestion thrown out, and found it couldn't be done.
eng_Latn she cried in real anxiety and burst into tears.
eng_Latn I am only two and twenty
eng_Latn I shut the door again.
eng_Latn you'll say, 'I sure do, mister.
eng_Latn for he knew that the authorities were wrong.
eng_Latn propped themselves on their elbows to talk.
eng_Latn will, produce before you substantiations of every one of them.
eng_Latn leaned on his elbows
eng_Latn one's eye moved on quickly to her daughter
eng_Latn the more's the pity!
eng_Latn I would never be an instrument of bringing a free and brave people into slavery.
eng_Latn he went out, closing the door after hiM
eng_Latn which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it
eng_Latn he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance
eng_Latn I'll stake something at faro, too, he he!
eng_Latn so the mention of his name
eng_Latn but the cushion for the countess
eng_Latn before I could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.
eng_Latn A campsite surrounded by nature.
eng_Latn about the way people work
eng_Latn I have a totally brilliant idea.
eng_Latn so great was her impatience to tell him the circumstance, at which she guessed he would be as much surprised as her.
eng_Latn again she recalled all she had seen.
eng_Latn the slightest trace of doubt in her tone.
eng_Latn Oh whiff whaff! I was presented with a Cheshire Cat by certain Mr. Lewis Carroll ... but it has disappeared.
eng_Latn she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
eng_Latn I was thirty.
eng_Latn I hope things will go happily with her.
eng_Latn hers for him was that she was indeed trifling with fire
eng_Latn had pulled this paper from his pocket, and presented it to her, indicating a few columns marked in pencil.
eng_Latn he muttered, almost embarrassed.
eng_Latn once or twice as she feverishly changed her position
eng_Latn as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle.
eng_Latn our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered,
eng_Latn or rather your wife only told us
eng_Latn he has run himself faint.
eng_Latn I don't need to get involved in anything like this.
eng_Latn Can we have another go?
eng_Latn though her heart knew him at once.
eng_Latn now, if any one said the thing which was not, these ends were defeated
eng_Latn without slowing it down.
eng_Latn but she had nobody to tell.
eng_Latn I open my mouth a couple of times to call after him
eng_Latn how rich you were
eng_Latn stopped quite near the approaching train.
eng_Latn there were no witnesses.
eng_Latn his left cheek, shoulder and arm bruised, but not otherwise injured
eng_Latn ...the twins.
eng_Latn in half an hour she spied me.
eng_Latn incline him to be satisfied with the match.
eng_Latn not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive.
eng_Latn I have a son too
eng_Latn I heard a rustling there.
eng_Latn I thought you were probably the man with the broken glasses and the queer philosophy.
eng_Latn I just want you to say if you can
eng_Latn all that I do not wish to remember.
eng_Latn the house was ramshackle after all
eng_Latn but it was enough.
eng_Latn took her daughter onto her lap
eng_Latn Argh behah! Oooh! Ouch!
eng_Latn whoever wants to flourish and become rich
eng_Latn I was already old while he was very young.
eng_Latn I said you didn't really want to come.
eng_Latn Just you wait till I catch you.
eng_Latn she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.
eng_Latn then raising her voice
eng_Latn he's in the forest
eng_Latn I did very miserably deceive you
eng_Latn I shall be ready for anything.
eng_Latn I want your permission to save her life.
eng_Latn besides, the appearance and disappearance ofLouis XVIII.
eng_Latn without telling them
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn that man's dead.
eng_Latn Oops, I don t Dog. So I won t fill it with water.
eng_Latn seizing five or six gnomes at once.
eng_Latn when they had departed
eng_Latn I knew him
eng_Latn (chuckling) Have you been talking to thebookshop mice again Pug?
eng_Latn afraid of letting a ready victim escape
eng_Latn I am only two and twenty
eng_Latn but he simply turned his head the other way
eng_Latn she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
eng_Latn he believed all he had read of him
eng_Latn lacerate her with the performance.
eng_Latn the only emotion she could not bear.
eng_Latn Ooh. I don t like having a bath!
eng_Latn that he knew anything against him
eng_Latn there was a burst of green light
eng_Latn obtaining access to the madman conversed with him for an hour or more
eng_Latn Pug has taught me I really am a badpainter. Now my only gallery is the rubbish bin.
eng_Latn I'll tell you how we'll do.
eng_Latn but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.
eng_Latn he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.
eng_Latn he slipped quietly down
eng_Latn See the Big Digger. See the Bigger Digger too. And the Tiny Digger, who showed them something new.
eng_Latn I haven't nowt in all the wureld that ain't yourn, my dear.
eng_Latn but presently reappeared, bearing half a dozen volumes in his hands
eng_Latn The biggest. The smallest. Theoddest. The first. In this book you will discover that truth is stranger than fiction.
eng_Latn I think Bedtime Baboon is reallytired.
eng_Latn two saving graces he had not learned in the house.
eng_Latn she knew it all, she belonged here more than I should ever do.
eng_Latn he loved the sea and love
eng_Latn I should never have the courage to come down again
eng_Latn Only one way to find out Pug. Let's follow that fiddle!
eng_Latn I'd like to give it away, he added bitterly.
eng_Latn not one of those noises was indispensable
eng_Latn awaited his directions.
eng_Latn her husband countered.
eng_Latn I loved her more than ever.
eng_Latn this standing still
eng_Latn by shuffling cards
eng_Latn ther'll be an idiot short.
eng_Latn in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
eng_Latn she's off hunting at the moment.
eng_Latn at last she was free.
eng_Latn I'd deflected him from his path
eng_Latn dictate any changes that she would like to have made there.
eng_Latn was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him
eng_Latn how warmly they had received her
eng_Latn And I think it taught us animportant lesson about leadership and co-operation.
eng_Latn I've gone through life like a bat out of hell
eng_Latn he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night
eng_Latn the composure of an older woman
eng_Latn And the whole world was a sandpit?
eng_Latn until that was done
eng_Latn I could have been.
eng_Latn after all she was only a little old woman in a black dress.
eng_Latn almost at the very moment when the bell rang at the finish of the race,
eng_Latn I'll tell you later.
eng_Latn when he's had the impudence to show it at the last.
eng_Latn Where are those Hot Dogs?
eng_Latn I'll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!
eng_Latn because at the bottom of his heart he was afraid that it was true
eng_Latn No, hundreds of ants. And they maynot all be friendly.
eng_Latn returned to the bedside
eng_Latn I dared not move.
eng_Latn I have come to tell you that this must end.
eng_Latn the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.
eng_Latn which was a new and higher kind of strength.
eng_Latn to sign the contract
eng_Latn so that thou repent not of what thou hast done
eng_Latn whence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field on the right hand
eng_Latn his head pillowed on his jacket.
eng_Latn I asked as lightly as I could manage.
eng_Latn I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is better'n you look.
eng_Latn when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room door.
eng_Latn I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you
eng_Latn eyes wide in the dark.
eng_Latn he would perhaps be so angry that I should have to leave
eng_Latn the ceiling blackened.
eng_Latn after all, a daughter looks better ill married than well whored.
eng_Latn I know I should clean it more
eng_Latn to address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a child's chair as the chair would hold
eng_Latn opened a drawer
eng_Latn at least not without moving someone else
eng_Latn but I didn't think.
eng_Latn then left me without a word.
eng_Latn but as a child I expressed my idea in the naive way recorded.
eng_Latn as she saw him, she staggered forward, and half fell into his outstretched arms.
eng_Latn bring his heart to its final pause.
eng_Latn I thought at the time what a picture it would make.
eng_Latn rushing out of the church.
eng_Latn from between the backs of those in front
eng_Latn then did both together.
eng_Latn didn't wake up.
eng_Latn he was both seen and heard
eng_Latn hence the absolute empireof the man over that woman.
eng_Latn I may find pearls.
eng_Latn I'm afraid not.
eng_Latn I went into the kitchen, and sat down to lull my little lamb to sleep.
eng_Latn never had one moment of happiness together.
eng_Latn but the storm had been so violent
eng_Latn if the person was caught
eng_Latn (SINGING) Puggle-Wuggle, do as you please.But don t pick our biscuity trees!
eng_Latn I wondered if she'd even bothered to go in?
eng_Latn he may have upset the case altogether.
eng_Latn as the reader chooses to consider it upon her relations with her husband
eng_Latn as though he were going to pick something up.
eng_Latn waiting there, she thought
eng_Latn one, on the staircase at dawn.
eng_Latn but I thought it was due to a very natural jealousy rather than to maternal solicitude.
eng_Latn fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it
eng_Latn I wiped it with a lace handkerchief
eng_Latn she walked round the room.
eng_Latn I forgot to take any blotting paper and my fountain pen leaked.
eng_Latn but she sat in the chair
eng_Latn I can t see any airport Dog.
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and smooth my hair back
eng_Latn with something under their arm
eng_Latn so that the beds had to be carried into the drawing room.
eng_Latn it wasn't long before the war was over
eng_Latn I will go with him now, if it's to death!
eng_Latn I'm not going to be tried.
eng_Latn because in the dreams he can talk.
eng_Latn though it wasn't.
eng_Latn but it was she.
eng_Latn or we will kill you and your gods!
eng_Latn I grinned at her and touched my forehead.
eng_Latn now raising myself up again
eng_Latn Umm Nor can I, Pug. What we need is a book that tells us what we did yesterday!
eng_Latn nothing and no one to betray
eng_Latn I may learn to value you as you deserve.
eng_Latn this has to happen.
eng_Latn that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.
eng_Latn why the watchmen had taken no alarm.
eng_Latn for now he had grown weary of change.
eng_Latn of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.
eng_Latn he tried to raise himself
eng_Latn her brother volunteered
eng_Latn I don't know how I could have slept through it.
eng_Latn I am his son.
eng_Latn then looked back and noted the house.
eng_Latn you are too young and light for this kind of thing.
eng_Latn as he considered himself more than fully indemnified for all by the payment he received in the gift of the treasure trove.
eng_Latn I love books that are full of excitement and thrills!
eng_Latn when an and wind began to blow
eng_Latn stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks.
eng_Latn but it was the kind of stiffness you know will work out with a little exercise.
eng_Latn or indeed do anything to demonstrate to her that he was truly delighted to see her again.
eng_Latn remember, wizards are coming from all over the world.
eng_Latn took great interest in him.
eng_Latn I had to pay a bill this afternoon.
eng_Latn oh, you remember that day!
eng_Latn I wouldnt pay more than that for it.
eng_Latn to describe the state of mind in which she hadapproached him
eng_Latn he began to think again about what she had feared.
eng_Latn proceeded not to weep, not to mourn, but mechanically to take off the wedding dress
eng_Latn but what was very moderate and very transient.
eng_Latn I never realised your nose was sodangerous Pug.
eng_Latn I deleted it.
eng_Latn there's some tents ahead.
eng_Latn I waited a month
eng_Latn Lord of the Rings ... Bees and Stings . Aah.. Solving Things !
eng_Latn handed down their cursed black flag
eng_Latn I look around
eng_Latn waiting till the tide was out
eng_Latn I should so hate for people to think me a thief.
eng_Latn And I am very grateful you ve been rounding up those naughty bookshop mice.
eng_Latn in any case, I have a rule in this school that
eng_Latn Please don t leave me Dog and Pug. I'm very lonely.
eng_Latn with anyone you like.
eng_Latn condemning me to take my meals alone
eng_Latn a silence, and then, without warning, the unmistakable swish and thud of an axe.
eng_Latn not this time singing
eng_Latn such was her darkness
eng_Latn we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.
eng_Latn I am so tranquil and happy now.
eng_Latn her head on the shoulder of her satiated husband.
eng_Latn surrounding his house
eng_Latn to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa.
eng_Latn the postmaster turned his horse into the yard
eng_Latn I'll do what has to be done.
eng_Latn must have died within minutes of retiring
eng_Latn looking me straight in the eyes, and then turned toMaxim.
eng_Latn as if tea had the restorative powers of brandy.
eng_Latn he was interested in her.
eng_Latn I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice, she began.
eng_Latn after having exhausted the ideal
eng_Latn there was the same lean porter standing at the gate
eng_Latn with proper masters, and could want nothing more.
eng_Latn Wow-Bowzer AND well done Dog and Pug! You ve solved my puzzles. Now I can put that naughty jigsaw piece back in it's place.
eng_Latn continued to turn it.
eng_Latn to hear him recite
eng_Latn besides, the appearance and disappearance ofLouis XVIII.
eng_Latn perhaps you'd better come, too
eng_Latn taking off his coat and spreading it lining side up on the ground so they could sit on it.
eng_Latn a cup not so big as a nut shell
eng_Latn for though it was covered up
eng_Latn but had never quite got to the point of doing it.
eng_Latn I will in a few words show you the real state of the case.
eng_Latn Oh no Dog. I'm not very good at acting.
eng_Latn she said, when she had somewhat recovered
eng_Latn as though they had all climbed it to get outside.
eng_Latn I know the answer to many riddles.
eng_Latn I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice, she began.
eng_Latn he held the mastery of them even in his sleep.
eng_Latn Greetings seekers of the weird and the wonderful. We are about to go on a journey.
eng_Latn for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter
eng_Latn as the reader chooses to consider it upon her relations with her husband
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all ...
eng_Latn I'm the servant girl.
eng_Latn he asked the major what did he think was going to happen now.
eng_Latn I'm fat, but I'm strong and healthy.
eng_Latn The hat?
eng_Latn bending, kissed her cheek.
eng_Latn then gazed out of the window again.
eng_Latn We will do our very best to find it. (sniffs the air) Pug, I smell a mystery!
eng_Latn Oh yes Dog. A herring told me.
eng_Latn that is wonderfully true.
eng_Latn Drat! They ve gone! They must haveescaped in their secret submarine!
eng_Latn very plain and rough in his exterior
eng_Latn still uncertain of myself and whether I was saying the right thing
eng_Latn I explained it.
eng_Latn numbed nerves were coming back to life and the old spirit was beginning to burn.
eng_Latn peeped into the hut.
eng_Latn that you remain so long unsolved
eng_Latn he was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd
eng_Latn to try if it came up to my own opinion of it
eng_Latn therefore told her, without any reflection upon her husband's unhandsome behaviour, that she need not frighten herself,
eng_Latn You two are brother and sister!!?
eng_Latn I bent down to go in, like a goose under a gate
eng_Latn again bade farewell to the strange doctor
eng_Latn when we came out to the car again I saw his car had been drawn up outside a cafe on the opposite side of the road.
eng_Latn thinking about what he had just heard
eng_Latn to get back to the spring
eng_Latn silence on both sides.
eng_Latn his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished,was the one condition'fully intelligible now'that her father had attached to their betrothal
eng_Latn I went to the window and swung back the shutter.
eng_Latn of which nothing remained but pestilence.
eng_Latn threw over his crutch
eng_Latn paused at the street end and looked about like a frightened and cautious animal.
eng_Latn Yup yup Yup. Ahh Come on Janice. Yupp
eng_Latn somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour boarder.
eng_Latn I wished we'd gone hunting somewhere else.
eng_Latn he was very busy.
eng_Latn I was to say nothing about him to anyone.
eng_Latn in the being near to the woman he loved.
eng_Latn as for patience you have abundantly proved yours you shall now see me prove mine
eng_Latn she does so want to see you.
eng_Latn but the passage was full of people
eng_Latn Come back!
eng_Latn the raw smell of hot dust was in the air.
eng_Latn perhaps be my death.
eng_Latn the wretchedness of an old man interests no one.
eng_Latn when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.
eng_Latn let us go to dinner.
eng_Latn before a youth of obviously so much more training and schooling than he possessed
eng_Latn the count will do me the justice
eng_Latn was one of the licensed pilots of the port
eng_Latn who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.
eng_Latn Really?! Bow-wowser!
eng_Latn much less properly spoken with him.
eng_Latn but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things.
eng_Latn I pondered this sentence painfully, after he was gone.
eng_Latn but said nothing.
eng_Latn I'm saying nothing.
eng_Latn 12. he is kind and compassionate to the poor and weak persons
eng_Latn he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth.
eng_Latn with his eyes almost shut
eng_Latn but no sound disturbed the quiet.
eng_Latn began to look about me.
eng_Latn he's in the forest
eng_Latn I glanced over my shoulder
eng_Latn but not to any particular one that I knew of.
eng_Latn he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air
eng_Latn I will need feeding in the night.
eng_Latn I needed time for its consideration.
eng_Latn Put me DOWN!
eng_Latn some unshaven, dirty man, girt with a sword and with a tiny cross embroidered in white cotton on the left breast of a lieutenant's uniform
eng_Latn all armed themselves with stones and formed in line
eng_Latn mules were hitched, their heads bowed against the cold misty rain
eng_Latn I'll give it you!
eng_Latn once or twice as she feverishly changed her position
eng_Latn I was once in such a scrape myself.
eng_Latn We re at the top of a lighthouse!
eng_Latn I reckon he'll know your name soon.
eng_Latn I think I know what it is.
eng_Latn I brought him down one evening, the day before yesterday
eng_Latn I must say hes generous.
eng_Latn but at length she raised her head
eng_Latn gripped the wheel so tightly
eng_Latn I lay on my side watching it.
eng_Latn stopped, right outside the staffroom door.
eng_Latn I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends,
eng_Latn Welcome to a world of exploration,where everything you need to have an adventure is inside your own mind.
eng_Latn the brink of my transformation from mortal to immortal.
eng_Latn legs thrust far forward, the wide brim of his hat set far back, making a sort of halo for his head.
eng_Latn that he looked upon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what accident he could not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen
eng_Latn you have a hole in your shirt.
eng_Latn Well... actually...
eng_Latn I'm not bisexual, either!
eng_Latn she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it
eng_Latn however, just as you like.
eng_Latn she would keep house for him
eng_Latn but I ran to the body of a tree
eng_Latn please let me out, mister
eng_Latn did I tell you that I dug his grave with my own hands
eng_Latn Dog, I'm very sorry. I won t make any more noise.
eng_Latn screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke elms
eng_Latn who hadnever had a doll in her life, a real doll
eng_Latn I'll see what I can do.
eng_Latn whether that consoling reflection was logical or not.
eng_Latn I rejoiced at his insistence
eng_Latn breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory
eng_Latn but the psychological feeling was still one of utter exposure.
eng_Latn I've been turning it back so I could do hours over again
eng_Latn whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?
eng_Latn a windfall, unexpected gold.
eng_Latn I'll pay you for it?
eng_Latn wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home
eng_Latn that is wonderfully true.
eng_Latn I took no notice
eng_Latn not this time singing
eng_Latn he abruptly bent double
eng_Latn after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board room.
eng_Latn it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.
eng_Latn she replied that 'no answer is the best answer. ' I think that was it.
eng_Latn This Pug has an umbrella!
eng_Latn they had neglected to keep their children in school in any one place.
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn I sure will be glad to get out there.
eng_Latn then inhaled sharply.
eng_Latn It's a very dark and stormy night!
eng_Latn We ve been reading about you allthe time?
eng_Latn that he would place himself at the head of the army
eng_Latn held her hand in his, guiding it
eng_Latn she took a few steps after me.
eng_Latn so he was thinking about her and her husband.
eng_Latn if they come here after him
eng_Latn Our sun is a star?
eng_Latn he slipped quietly down
eng_Latn setting down the feeble light on the dark mahogany table
eng_Latn the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became furious.
eng_Latn to turn your love into rage
eng_Latn knew the danger of his extended position
eng_Latn as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.
eng_Latn as many pages as he had written since his farewell to her.
eng_Latn I picked up from the ground things that were lying there.
eng_Latn glanced towards me.
eng_Latn who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady
eng_Latn I hate fainting in front of a roomful of men.
eng_Latn the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker's boat
eng_Latn and took up a book marked by a mother of pearl knife inlaid with gold
eng_Latn they trundled out of the yard
eng_Latn I grab my jacket and almost run out of the office
eng_Latn I suggested that he should go home for a while.
eng_Latn That s much better.
eng_Latn I've a mind to take the watch back.
eng_Latn whereupon they stole off unperceived.
eng_Latn who had been seated a quarter of an hour on his box
eng_Latn I'd nodded once, and then turned my face straight forward.
eng_Latn I got up late.
eng_Latn for the second time in my life only the second time I became insensible from terror.
eng_Latn he had no need to be surrounded by beautiful things.
eng_Latn he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth.
eng_Latn which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas rather than of wool.
eng_Latn which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.
eng_Latn as though it had run headlong into a brick wall.
eng_Latn she could not stand it.
eng_Latn maybe two three thousan' folks gets movin' account a this here han'bill.
eng_Latn Welcome Dog. Welcome Pug.
eng_Latn Dog? Are you there?
eng_Latn I old a pistol in my hand!
eng_Latn a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard.
eng_Latn I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt.
eng_Latn the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics
eng_Latn it will be the duty of you gentlemen to givethe defendant the benefit of the doubt raised.
eng_Latn they must go softly
eng_Latn I turned to run
eng_Latn but the storm had been so violent
eng_Latn he asked sullenly.
eng_Latn so she rocked
eng_Latn I will not hinder you.
eng_Latn I got up late.
eng_Latn the state of his mind is as clear and decided
eng_Latn I read it on the train coming here
eng_Latn suddenly she realized that the room was not empty.
eng_Latn Yes you do Pug.
eng_Latn dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad
eng_Latn they should have been on the trail an hour gone.
eng_Latn I had to work.
eng_Latn turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at.
eng_Latn but I can't help it.
eng_Latn a new trial on appeal would certainly be granted
eng_Latn I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it owed its several motions
eng_Latn but this is quite between ourselves.
eng_Latn without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier, or the gown of the magistrate
eng_Latn he could get nothing out of her.
eng_Latn next to the bare expanse of his back.
eng_Latn by infantry and cavalry, had to face all sides.
eng_Latn I can answer for its being so on his.
eng_Latn any more than the rising sun had rays.
eng_Latn but a very good doctor.
eng_Latn very happy to see you, which seemed to indicate that perhaps
eng_Latn I don't like her snooping around.
eng_Latn so that the beds had to be carried into the drawing room.
eng_Latn at the same time I told him not to let the affair go on any further.
eng_Latn he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest.
eng_Latn I said no
eng_Latn I asked her for it long ago.
eng_Latn The Wonderful World of Nursery Rhymes!
eng_Latn though it wasn't.
eng_Latn I am sure it was not his fault.
eng_Latn we believe thata perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living.
eng_Latn I must go and tell my uncle.
eng_Latn I'm sure of it.
eng_Latn whistling to his own leash of borzois
eng_Latn I think it's frightened of us Dog!
eng_Latn that they had much to say to one another in private
eng_Latn for he remained in the rooM
eng_Latn who have chosen that career, and one must allow that every calling has its disagreeable side.
eng_Latn who had never even heard of it by name.
eng_Latn the skin of which is covered with a fine down.
eng_Latn who attends my mother
eng_Latn thence upon the leads and gutters
eng_Latn when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail
eng_Latn I did the wolf whined
eng_Latn therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it.
eng_Latn I push my hair back off my face.
eng_Latn then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.
eng_Latn entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.
eng_Latn he told the housekeeper to take all the big ones and throw them into the yard.
eng_Latn how their husbands would be friends, and how happy they would be.
eng_Latn if she resists, say I shall come
eng_Latn Please come back!
eng_Latn to think before you do.
eng_Latn I shall look after them without that.
eng_Latn on opening the door himself, for a moment he did not know me.
eng_Latn he has become intensely interested in looking after it.
eng_Latn could mention historical examples before unknown to her.
eng_Latn flapped the reins.
eng_Latn it was very dark.
eng_Latn I can't stand any more.
eng_Latn not for one minute could we leave him alone.
eng_Latn without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier, or the gown of the magistrate
eng_Latn jus' round this bend here.
eng_Latn I'd never met any vampires less civilized.
eng_Latn to pity us
eng_Latn tried to speak to him
eng_Latn but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate.
eng_Latn but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.
eng_Latn when I got round to him, not he.
eng_Latn And we re a pair because we have adventures together!
eng_Latn which I hoped would do me good.
eng_Latn I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it.
eng_Latn I would gladly eat a bit of something
eng_Latn in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt.
eng_Latn because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years
eng_Latn she cried in real anxiety and burst into tears.
eng_Latn he waited until they announced his room to be ready.
eng_Latn suddenly seems the funniest thing in the world, and before I know it, I've started laughing.
eng_Latn when he repeated his vow of eternal fidelity and everlasting love
eng_Latn a couple of you could be creatively brainstorming
eng_Latn but he does not like talking himself and can't do it, as you will see.
eng_Latn his eyes closed.
eng_Latn she had been recently stuffed.
eng_Latn took two quick swallows,recorked it
eng_Latn a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.
eng_Latn maybe we're dead and this is what we've chosen for the afterlife.
eng_Latn I'm quite comfortable.
eng_Latn gave me just enough money for my journey
eng_Latn ...I love to read a thrilling mystery story.
eng_Latn had a son who went through life wearing loose, baggy trousers and
eng_Latn I'll not risk my heart a third time.
eng_Latn apropos, what is become of him?
eng_Latn the feeling of hostility persisted dimly and obscurely.
eng_Latn I waited for him to go on.
eng_Latn It's so white here Dog. Aren t there any words in this book?
eng_Latn no servant will be offered you.
eng_Latn probably without seeing us.
eng_Latn but at close quarters it's almost impossible.
eng_Latn eyes wide in the dark.
eng_Latn I shall always value the necklace, and it was very kind of you to give it me.
eng_Latn but by the time he reached him he was already on the ground
eng_Latn I say, we were so robbed,and hunted
eng_Latn in excuse for leaning down her face
eng_Latn each waiting for the others to start a fight.
eng_Latn but it was she.
eng_Latn the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.
eng_Latn We ve read a book about you before Mr Beards.
eng_Latn he was himself as one dead.
eng_Latn like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong.
eng_Latn he has left me nothing nothing!
eng_Latn his son, and the boy's tutor
eng_Latn in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth.
eng_Latn so he was thinking about her and her husband.
eng_Latn lay hold of each other
eng_Latn It certainly has Dog. Bookshop mices!
eng_Latn dress it as well as I could.
eng_Latn I love him, and love is very sweet.
eng_Latn Look at those special effects Dog!
eng_Latn as being the dupes of a wily fraud
eng_Latn I can't believe you missed the game last night just to watch somebody sleep
eng_Latn I need more than five.
eng_Latn out of the war he carried two memories.
eng_Latn suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand
eng_Latn with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it.
eng_Latn but he could no longer do it.
eng_Latn he had seen the body of the commander
eng_Latn that to act in that way would have been almost impossible
eng_Latn Ho.Oh. Dog and Pug, thank-you for helping me find my way through that maze of information. Let me tell you what I think of you... in herring!
eng_Latn out of which there jumped a fat gentleman
eng_Latn nephews, brothers, husbands of favourite sisters, bosom friends, trusty supporters or prominent supporters of whom perhaps they were afraid.
eng_Latn I like a man with hidden depths.
eng_Latn I'll cure myself of this.
eng_Latn as to urge no influence against me.
eng_Latn twenty three years ago
eng_Latn then flapped past him
eng_Latn that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to keep my soul alive in.
eng_Latn I assure you I have.
eng_Latn when I woke up
eng_Latn but he mustn't catch it yet
eng_Latn there is no living being who has not done it.
eng_Latn I am the person you inquired for.
eng_Latn he surrounded me with his arm, almost as if he loved me
eng_Latn but had her reasons.
eng_Latn with very heavy eyebrows
eng_Latn I want to be there when every one suddenly understands what it has all been for.
eng_Latn I don't like that way of doing things.
eng_Latn advance him, and reward him.
eng_Latn his daughter had at last forgotten
eng_Latn to invade a country after the people have been wasted by famine
eng_Latn he'd be as generous as his friend SenecaDoane.
eng_Latn give me a bit more time.
eng_Latn there's some tents ahead.
eng_Latn no help to be had.
eng_Latn filled it half with hot water and half with cold.
eng_Latn so will have an end without a name
eng_Latn at the risk of being stifled
eng_Latn for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here.
eng_Latn I love him, and love is very sweet.
eng_Latn tried to speak to him
eng_Latn the poor fellow was obliged to confess the promise torn from him by his mother.
eng_Latn I glanced over my shoulder
eng_Latn I will help him as much as I can.
eng_Latn I was lost to a sea of cold
eng_Latn I will do nothing for you.
eng_Latn until the very moment when they climbed into the tumbrils.
eng_Latn Did he say d-dragon Dog?!
eng_Latn which must be the only scene of my escape, if ever it should happen.
eng_Latn conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend
eng_Latn but for the first time picturing to himself her soul.
eng_Latn This tomb is VERY doomy Dog.
eng_Latn if I cared to settle two or three thousand on him for life he would never worry me again.
eng_Latn followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand.
eng_Latn I normally get about ten emails every morning, if that.
eng_Latn he must be a great criminal
eng_Latn much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride
eng_Latn comes a voice over the intercom
eng_Latn his son, and the boy's tutor
eng_Latn had to stop.
eng_Latn I know and it looks so fun.
eng_Latn I. Am. A. Robot.
eng_Latn but I wish you had.
eng_Latn so I entered to see.
eng_Latn anyone beating him at anything
eng_Latn when he should again interrogate her
eng_Latn yes I can easily comprehend that
eng_Latn I liked the way he looked at me as he listened.
eng_Latn moving with great deliberation from one hold to the next.
eng_Latn I think that was a sign we should go home Dog.
eng_Latn And who can resist a race!? Giddy up Declan!
eng_Latn to interview and make studies of him.
eng_Latn couldn't think of anything to say, and closed it again.
eng_Latn from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional
eng_Latn eyes still closed.
eng_Latn she sont me to drive you.
eng_Latn in my own time and way.
eng_Latn At the moment it looks rather like both Pug.
eng_Latn I wish you a good day.
eng_Latn I back up to the bed.
eng_Latn I lose my temper on the slightest provocation, flare up, and then it's all over.
eng_Latn there's some tents ahead.
eng_Latn my name she muttered
eng_Latn hold our breath
eng_Latn I trust, however, that the time here has not been passed unpleasantly to you.
eng_Latn These photos are going to make the next edition of my book a number one best seller!
eng_Latn I thought you were probably the man with the broken glasses and the queer philosophy.
eng_Latn I had a line about my waist
eng_Latn than I should be for not wanting a leg or an arm
eng_Latn continued to turn it.
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn I was glad she had rung up
eng_Latn but this form, were it only the shape of a white lamp shade looming on a wicker table
eng_Latn perceived that what he said about his improvement was true
eng_Latn raw from the chafing of the iron.
eng_Latn thence upon the leads and gutters
eng_Latn still fully dressed.
eng_Latn slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions.
eng_Latn after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before.
eng_Latn above the average in height
eng_Latn she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift.
eng_Latn the wretchedness of an old man interests no one.
eng_Latn her control came back, and her hand dropped.
eng_Latn but not many had died there.
eng_Latn but they paused to listen.
eng_Latn they would be renewed
eng_Latn but keep your eyes off me,
eng_Latn Bow-wowzers, Dog, that s brilliant. Let's do it right away. Well, almost right away.
eng_Latn I want you to get out of this town.
eng_Latn it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.
eng_Latn Bet you can t see me now Dog.
eng_Latn Blue paint. Blue paint. Where do Ifind some blue paint?
eng_Latn brought up his knees.
eng_Latn I'm not dancing
eng_Latn you'll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me.
eng_Latn he and his son arrived next day.
eng_Latn if you devote yourself to it, you get on.
eng_Latn kneel down kneel round her
eng_Latn a profound silence seeming to precede, accompanyand follow it,
eng_Latn pray to be better!
eng_Latn So it was a lovely place to sit.
eng_Latn taking the four reals
eng_Latn first bowing profoundly
eng_Latn the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.
eng_Latn again and again she tried to do so.
eng_Latn without some stain of infamy or blood to soil the uniform of the soldier, or the gown of the magistrate
eng_Latn of discovering an enemy
eng_Latn but I licked you!
eng_Latn in this way we shall be satisfied and easy
eng_Latn falling back in his chair
eng_Latn I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.
eng_Latn but, lighting on a passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume
eng_Latn I miss my truck, I whimpered to myself.
eng_Latn with very heavy eyebrows
eng_Latn he tightened his grasp upon my hand
eng_Latn but that seemed to him quite natural.
eng_Latn I would not have you suffer half what I have done!
eng_Latn the finding of the knife near the corpse.
eng_Latn she had little eyes, sparkling like beads, and an effusive manner.
eng_Latn pulled a sack of tobacco and a book of papers from his side pocket.
eng_Latn it cost fifty.
eng_Latn Forsooth, it's Bob and Doug! Where is my pet dragon?
eng_Latn to have a house elf in my bedroom.
eng_Latn I noticed that there was a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you know I have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and I have had it from a baby.
eng_Latn I don't want you for nothing, anyway.
eng_Latn We must fly to the moon to fill it up again. How are we re going to get there without any magic moon dust?
eng_Latn Patience, my friend. Every strokeis precious.
eng_Latn only for an instant see the wretch.
eng_Latn I was a zombie of sleeplessness.
eng_Latn that's on the edge of the grave.
eng_Latn If ever there was a place full of precious things then that place was...
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book... and it's given me a new idea.
eng_Latn but at length she raised her head
eng_Latn I got the paper and read it yesterday.
eng_Latn a lean, haggard face, ragged beard and hair, and had walked in limping, with a crooked branch of a tree for a staff.
eng_Latn Everyone back to my place for asnowball fight!!
eng_Latn but I awoke next morning after nine o'clock when they knocked at my door.
eng_Latn after that we saw him no more
eng_Latn each turned his attention to the weapon he would be using on the night of the strike.
eng_Latn but because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride.
eng_Latn as long a dream as that
eng_Latn not having felt her mode of answering him at all offensive.
eng_Latn if it be accompanied by practice.
eng_Latn I'm of no mind to have my money used for the benefit of such a person.
eng_Latn opened it, drew out three bank bills, which he laid on thetable.
eng_Latn I cleared it and told him I'd written a story.
eng_Latn I mean real fighting.
eng_Latn his arms splattered with white paint.
eng_Latn I see everything through the eyes of the beast.
eng_Latn we stayed behind
eng_Latn which was always there, upon a little table
eng_Latn he had suddenly felt uneasy.
eng_Latn her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves.
eng_Latn there were scarcely six months between them.
eng_Latn not even a cat.
eng_Latn I'd already put this off too long.
eng_Latn jeweled with flowers.
eng_Latn they stopped and I stopped.
eng_Latn And we win...
eng_Latn but I desired to divert him from his reverie
eng_Latn though it's a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that.
eng_Latn And it is called...
eng_Latn till I get what I want.
eng_Latn he resolutely began the ascent.
eng_Latn I have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs
eng_Latn but it now carried her captive.
eng_Latn I love the smell of them.
eng_Latn a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position.
eng_Latn I'll tell the truth.
eng_Latn sometimes there's an inch of silver six words in the bottom of the net.
eng_Latn presently returned with the wagon
eng_Latn Everyone run to the left!
eng_Latn Don t show me. Put it back in the pack...
eng_Latn I've seen you as a wolf.
eng_Latn which had crumbled, essaying once more toadvance.
eng_Latn he surveyed its legs with a smile.
eng_Latn so... To be or not to be?
eng_Latn seeing it was no use
eng_Latn he pretended not to understand, and turned the conversation.
eng_Latn until it and all it contained were consumed in flames.
eng_Latn when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no longer.
eng_Latn how wicked it was of you to go to that battle!
eng_Latn she had stood by her husband's side perfectly silent
eng_Latn she looked down into the sparkling waters
eng_Latn he shook his head in submission.
eng_Latn rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.
eng_Latn as he was pleased to call it.
eng_Latn she could have nothing to explore or to suffer
eng_Latn No. Wow-bowzer. Bow-wowzer would bea silly name for a ship.
eng_Latn thinking she would turn around and go back.
eng_Latn it was very dark.
eng_Latn if you allow me to say so or yet yours.
eng_Latn waiting to be asked to dance when she was asked for a waltz
eng_Latn kept me awake.
eng_Latn Where are we Dog?
eng_Latn Oh yes I am!
eng_Latn for, going back a little, she took a short run
eng_Latn but by the time he realized that he had been swindled
eng_Latn which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever.
eng_Latn but, which, instead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.
eng_Latn the guard guy of the truck rabbed him
eng_Latn she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest.
eng_Latn seemed to understand, but would say nothing.
eng_Latn if the said rich man was once on a time poor
eng_Latn no importunate, overbearing
eng_Latn then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.
eng_Latn I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man
eng_Latn took great interest in him.
eng_Latn you'd been killed before their very eves.
eng_Latn yet my gladness was not without admixture.
eng_Latn for it is bitter cold.
eng_Latn has done for you he gave you health
eng_Latn but her eyes were fine
eng_Latn a white kerseymere waistcoat, and nankeen pantaloons, three inches too short, but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee
eng_Latn the great confidence I repose in thee!
eng_Latn losing more men at every step that it took.
eng_Latn I love him, and love is very sweet.
eng_Latn I wasn't big enough to frighten by looks alone.
eng_Latn he scuffing one foot and looking unhappy.
eng_Latn so terrifying the neatness of that other death which exists within death
eng_Latn he must depart from the country.
eng_Latn you two go that way
eng_Latn And Enid did write down herstories...dozens of them...and we still thrill to her adventures today.
eng_Latn here she flung her hand out
eng_Latn which she did with right good will
eng_Latn he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
eng_Latn the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.
eng_Latn I'm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow.
eng_Latn I stick out my hand and hail a taxi
eng_Latn then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.
eng_Latn I hope that's okay by you
eng_Latn Once upon a time, in an tropicalforest, lived Camille, a young lizard, with an incredible ability to hide....
eng_Latn to have another think.
eng_Latn I am unhappy enough as it is!
eng_Latn I'm ashamed of you for crying.
eng_Latn without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.
eng_Latn I looked at him quickly.
eng_Latn gripe your oars, and clutch your souls, now!
eng_Latn I wanted to run away when I was fourteen years old
eng_Latn would not she give him her influence in procuring it?
eng_Latn though they were not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and visit the invalid.
eng_Latn mounted his horse
eng_Latn we will stay together.
eng_Latn that of being upset
eng_Latn Yes Pug.
eng_Latn but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months.
eng_Latn he must be a great criminal
eng_Latn I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way.
eng_Latn Oh. Our batteries have run out.
eng_Latn the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery.
eng_Latn whether he admitted it or not.
eng_Latn I can see a two too!
eng_Latn declared he had said a very good thing.
eng_Latn half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief.
eng_Latn it was five minutes to eight
eng_Latn on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence
eng_Latn my life will be bitter without you.
eng_Latn I must at least try to be one
eng_Latn but you did,
eng_Latn I hoped she did.
eng_Latn but he is not stupid.
eng_Latn had broken out among the guests.
eng_Latn All the better for looking, Pug.
eng_Latn she could not stand it.
eng_Latn I want to embrace.
eng_Latn lifting the mare's head and letting it go in time with her paces.
eng_Latn pausing for just a moment to let the light spill into the boy's room
eng_Latn the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her
eng_Latn The cup! (LAUGHING)
eng_Latn I was always of the party
eng_Latn I examined first, the parlour, and then its occupant.
eng_Latn not a pickle eater.
eng_Latn when I was nearly four that I suddenly realized that we owned a dog.
eng_Latn that it was as if a cannon ball had hit me and got stuck inside.
eng_Latn he drew her aside.
eng_Latn four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores
eng_Latn then unhappiness came.
eng_Latn she was the exact opposite of my mother
eng_Latn captivity has subdued me
eng_Latn I bury forever any hope of ever standing alone.
eng_Latn then fell swamping back into the deep.
eng_Latn Oh And neither is this.
eng_Latn I've never seen you obsess over a real person.
eng_Latn had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed
eng_Latn I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
eng_Latn I hope you two are marking my words,
eng_Latn it was trivial
eng_Latn I forgot to take any blotting paper and my fountain pen leaked.
eng_Latn I'd give my life to serve you.
eng_Latn quite pleased apparently.
eng_Latn there, surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.
eng_Latn only two guns out of five remained in a state for service.
eng_Latn I will in a few words show you the real state of the case.
eng_Latn I will do it yet.
eng_Latn but had her reasons.
eng_Latn as if we were bound for the house
eng_Latn a few more seconds went by.
eng_Latn Colourful Marbles ... Mysterious Parcels ..Aah. Magnificent Castles!
eng_Latn though he would hardly have borne them from another man.
eng_Latn for if you are killed I shall be alone in the world
eng_Latn Er..Granny Pug... What do you callstars that are coming towards you really fast?
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all I love books that are…
eng_Latn if someone throws something at you
eng_Latn one day, if I allow you to live
eng_Latn they were all seated and busy
eng_Latn I had now leisure to examine the purse.
eng_Latn but his eyes were distant and unfocused
eng_Latn with his mouth close to her ear.
eng_Latn then, with a cry of anguish, she tottered forward, stretching out her arms to him.
eng_Latn I found the treasure.
eng_Latn if they come here after him
eng_Latn Its a deal.
eng_Latn who was directing his steps
eng_Latn I smelled fresh blood and saw that the cup was in her hands again.
eng_Latn if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.
eng_Latn said let him try
eng_Latn he hated her for being alive while the other was dead.
eng_Latn I didn't know I should do that.
eng_Latn she had not so much as deigned to admit he existed.
eng_Latn as incredulous of my sanity.
eng_Latn that I shall perhaps never use!
eng_Latn to come and upset us in this manner!
eng_Latn I'll say it's a doggone shame!
eng_Latn the great adventure itself must be a dream!
eng_Latn when the occasionpresents itself, we tell the truth about it.
eng_Latn Oh - have you read it too, Pug?
eng_Latn but he felt only air
eng_Latn it was not a bad one in itself.
eng_Latn MNoirtier looked after the servant until the door was closed
eng_Latn a high and holy person like that looked on it as an honour!
eng_Latn his thick brown curls were rough and uncultivated
eng_Latn I think I'm gonna be sick.
eng_Latn I came on something which was certainly new.
eng_Latn his voice echoing in the dark passage.
eng_Latn stroking me gently with the other.
eng_Latn I replied that she would not be harmed.
eng_Latn but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it.
eng_Latn I tried to listen to other sounds
eng_Latn he went off to see my father
eng_Latn I just looked straight ahead.
eng_Latn I didn't know it was like that.
eng_Latn I wish I could see more stars.
eng_Latn I knocked him sprawling.
eng_Latn swathed in a long black traveling cloak
eng_Latn that he would take from me the heart of the girl I love.
eng_Latn I thought she'd had it then!
eng_Latn it was at least ten minutes before he was summoned.
eng_Latn together they buried the empty coffin.
eng_Latn Bedtime Baboon sprinkles dust from the Moon, sending children to sleep inside cosy bedrooms.
eng_Latn This is a book called...
eng_Latn I took a step forward.
eng_Latn for in truth you are to blame for their not wanting to hear you.
eng_Latn I'd had three vodkas
eng_Latn one in the other loosely clasped.
eng_Latn I wanted to,
eng_Latn there came a sudden loud screech from behind him
eng_Latn he drew the glove from his shapely white hand
eng_Latn along with some of the teeth of the gang.
eng_Latn although they were extraordinarily short
eng_Latn got my head into his mouth.
eng_Latn I will never do that.
eng_Latn but I won't go.
eng_Latn though I don't recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.
eng_Latn encouraged to receive me kindly
eng_Latn How curious. Pug? Pug? Pug?
eng_Latn he went back to open his office under the protection of the soldiers.
eng_Latn I have still the same old illusions.
eng_Latn when he laid his hand upon my arm.
eng_Latn he told me that he had arranged for his wife to have a private room
eng_Latn so take it away
eng_Latn that he would place himself at the head of the army
eng_Latn he very much doubted whether she understood exactly what she felt for him.
eng_Latn the others were only reflections of that living fire of goodness and love.
eng_Latn To the wheelie-ladder, Pug!
eng_Latn for then, to make them write for it more pressingly
eng_Latn I wondered why he didnt bring you around here before.
eng_Latn Perhaps you should try something challenging that doesn t involve dog biscuits Pug.
eng_Latn I floundered around in my head, trying to remember how to close it.
eng_Latn but it was not his tractor.
eng_Latn relieving him of the visor, already battered to pieces by blows
eng_Latn after that we saw him no more
eng_Latn the shop was not closed
eng_Latn There must be more. I need to countthem! See you in my next book boys!
eng_Latn I loped through the thick forest toward them.
eng_Latn was much beyond her daily reach
eng_Latn then she shivered at the touch of a hand on her sleeve
eng_Latn he can make a place for himself in my husband's factory.
eng_Latn thinking to himself
eng_Latn I try to smile, but my face won't quite do it.
eng_Latn that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to keep my soul alive in.
eng_Latn I stumbled and wished all the time that I could bail out.
eng_Latn but there was such a leaden dread at his heart
eng_Latn but all your frightful stories have so upset me
eng_Latn Now, perhaps you d like to play a game?
eng_Latn which was a new and higher kind of strength.
eng_Latn she wished her volatile scientist husband would be careful with his outbursts
eng_Latn or living any other life, for that would be alien to them forever.
eng_Latn I believe that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady.
eng_Latn I came to thank you for saving my father's life.
eng_Latn Hath courage.... be brave...
eng_Latn I could almost wish you had shouted and shown a light.
eng_Latn I'm not going to be chewed out again.
eng_Latn his head pillowed on his jacket.
eng_Latn Will do.
eng_Latn I then took my tackling.
eng_Latn implore him to be a merciful ass
eng_Latn suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face.
eng_Latn hurrying along the corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go
eng_Latn the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick.
eng_Latn when he had nothing to eat and nowhere to go
eng_Latn he was going to be all that his uncle and cousin obviously expected of him
eng_Latn but upon the accident that happened to the emperor's horse, they alighted, and came near his person
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn I hope it will cure him.
eng_Latn I asked, my voice a little too curious.
eng_Latn she so delights in your conversation
eng_Latn upon this very case, I had frequently run over the whole system how I should employ myself
eng_Latn I never was whipped in school.
eng_Latn but he does know his own pocket.
eng_Latn I folded the paper
eng_Latn he thought it best to say nothing and so for the timebeing had denied everything
eng_Latn I haven't heard a word from him since he was here.
eng_Latn the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction.
eng_Latn got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me.
eng_Latn stay where you are
eng_Latn but in the future society it will be perfectly normal
eng_Latn Everyone tie the ropes onto theshow shoes.
eng_Latn grew in the dooryard and up against the house, and the cotton was about the shed barn.
eng_Latn it is no sin to remember a grief.
eng_Latn infact, at the very first instant, hastened to the officer of the watch
eng_Latn I do not even want you to speak to her again.
eng_Latn they did not seem to belong to the same species
eng_Latn having been often reduced to hard fare in my life
eng_Latn I'm ignorant of it!
eng_Latn I cringed internally at her imagined reaction.
eng_Latn but he now determined to go home early in the morning.
eng_Latn though there you are, and you may lay to it.
eng_Latn Bats.. Cats..Aah .. H-eadwear!
eng_Latn was one of the licensed pilots of the port
eng_Latn declared he had said a very good thing.
eng_Latn I'll have to look elsewhere for allies.
eng_Latn Oh Not a problem Pug. Some Spell O Tape should do the trick . Ha ha!
eng_Latn that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter
eng_Latn not noticeable at a distance
eng_Latn but I was hungry enough that I didn't care.
eng_Latn having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship.
eng_Latn nor will it be eradicated till this mortal shall put on immortality.
eng_Latn none here are loyal to me
eng_Latn Here s a simple one. Where are we?
eng_Latn all joined hands
eng_Latn he had tried
eng_Latn when she was done with him
eng_Latn I didn't follow you because I was after a promotion.
eng_Latn edged her chair away from him.
eng_Latn there, my master leaning on his lance
eng_Latn had associated her quite newly in carrying out his plan.
eng_Latn from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.
eng_Latn bent over the body.
eng_Latn we could live in the house.
eng_Latn after that we saw him no more
eng_Latn that no other spiritual aid should be called in.
eng_Latn I took particular notice of him this time
eng_Latn waited an hour and a half.
eng_Latn Oh We re so sorry.
eng_Latn I took her face in my hand.
eng_Latn she came out of the bathroom with only a towel around her waist, her blond hair damp and curling.
eng_Latn had never had a moment's hesitation about doing what he ought to do.
eng_Latn Oh no! It's invisible again!
eng_Latn the way people are rebuilding
eng_Latn I will reflect.
eng_Latn I'm not so foolish as to deny the force of the language.
eng_Latn I am so tranquil and happy now.
eng_Latn for no doubt the giant is dead by this time
eng_Latn were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot.
eng_Latn but he does know his own pocket.
eng_Latn shark is only one syllable.
eng_Latn who looked like an underfed vulture.
eng_Latn unscrewed the metal cap
eng_Latn he had had enough of them
eng_Latn whether he admitted it or not.
eng_Latn I do not think so.
eng_Latn I am very glad you were well enough and I hope you had a pleasant party
eng_Latn thought about it then, as well as he could, and he surrendered his weapons.
eng_Latn I endeavored to catch your eye
eng_Latn it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.
eng_Latn because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows
eng_Latn he was down there visiting it.
eng_Latn in the taste displayed in furnishing, and in the rapidity with which it was executed
eng_Latn lay on his back with his hands behind his head
eng_Latn if you ever want to see him at all.
eng_Latn How long will not seeing anything go on for?
eng_Latn I've never heard such terrible lies in my whole life.
eng_Latn but as he tried to stand
eng_Latn it's just been such a shock.
eng_Latn to see a man of apparently sound sense
eng_Latn taking off his coat and spreading it lining side up on the ground so they could sit on it.
eng_Latn Since No-Beards became the captain she s been a right old bossy boots.
eng_Latn never able to get rid of the sour taste of doubt in your mouth
eng_Latn arriving by flying car.
eng_Latn you know, the very first time we met.
eng_Latn come to security.
eng_Latn he had to stoop quickly to catch it.
eng_Latn Now that I remember - it was the best part of the day....
eng_Latn husbands daughters and sons even infants in arms.
eng_Latn I thought you might like to know he was there, if you had anything to say to him.
eng_Latn That didn t really help.
eng_Latn she had succeeded, she was satisfied.
eng_Latn afraid of letting a ready victim escape
eng_Latn cried she, throwing back her veil
eng_Latn not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances.
eng_Latn I haven't nowt in all the wureld that ain't yourn, my dear.
eng_Latn but not for long
eng_Latn see if any of you have begun to learn to spell.
eng_Latn saved the Kingdom AND a dragon.
eng_Latn I bolted the door.
eng_Latn brought it about that when we were now in mid sea
eng_Latn reflected that he might have a cold.
eng_Latn they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by comparison.
eng_Latn then you will know the happiness of forgiving.
eng_Latn don't say good bye
eng_Latn they so far succeeded
eng_Latn so I answered him with a contented smile.
eng_Latn I reckon she was so mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me
eng_Latn I'd like to give it away, he added bitterly.
eng_Latn Not underwater, Pug?
eng_Latn now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason.
eng_Latn I'm so glad I found you in.
eng_Latn Umm Funny Faces... Sunny Places ..Ahh. Silly Races!
eng_Latn she recalled his composure, and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits.
eng_Latn Them?
eng_Latn the abbe sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed
eng_Latn should he retreat after going so far?
eng_Latn for the devil himself has carried all away.
eng_Latn Not one of those, no. A book.
eng_Latn it has not been possible to lay hands on it.
eng_Latn And so Splendina became the Great Splendina again
eng_Latn Ooh Thank-you fairy dog-fathers.
eng_Latn taking off his coat and spreading it lining side up on the ground so they could sit on it.
eng_Latn Is that you Pug?
eng_Latn putting the light near his face
eng_Latn who had perished from hunger.
eng_Latn though it's not important.
eng_Latn but neither of us could understand a syllable.
eng_Latn pushing the knife away from his body so that he wouldn't hurt himself on it.
eng_Latn Bad news, Dog. So am I! WAAAAAH! Ooo.
eng_Latn came to think of armies, or to teach his people the practice of military discipline.
eng_Latn from which place, he was to despatch, a constable and doctor.
eng_Latn open the door!
eng_Latn I know what I'll do.
eng_Latn But a portrait is supposed to makeyou look good Dog.
eng_Latn I've never seen you obsess over a real person.
eng_Latn then unhappiness came.
eng_Latn so I recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him
eng_Latn she crossed herself.
eng_Latn looking as serious as he could
eng_Latn silently continued to walk to and fro.
eng_Latn having gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked back to see if he might hope for pardon.
eng_Latn to my infinite terror,
eng_Latn I ask just one thing of you, cousin, she went on
eng_Latn pushed his hand away.
eng_Latn the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.
eng_Latn You mean - mutiny?
eng_Latn I couldn't even enjoy his anguish.
eng_Latn the contemplation of life and conduct through the lens furnished by a purely sectarian creed.
eng_Latn he said and left the room.
eng_Latn but eventually concluded that he needn't do so, since in spite of it he was truly sorry for the old man.
eng_Latn but his strength failed him and he sank into a chair
eng_Latn I thought I could go back to being a private again
eng_Latn I've been promoted
eng_Latn I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter.
eng_Latn Too late. By now they must be halfway to their secret hideout on Skull Island. We ll need a boat... or a sea plane... or a rocket!
eng_Latn for ever maybe.
eng_Latn a little weather beaten to be sure but not much
eng_Latn she did not think of tears at first
eng_Latn It's your imagination Dog.
eng_Latn the soldiers of theEmpire setting out on a fresh campaign
eng_Latn I've gone through life like a bat out of hell
eng_Latn I'm sure of it.
eng_Latn the chauffeur drove on.
eng_Latn he repeated from the steps.
eng_Latn I do care about your mother's money going
eng_Latn I woke up in a hospital. I was only there two days.
eng_Latn I dont much care whether its inside, outside, or halfway between.
eng_Latn though he prided himself on keeping up with whatever was the latest fad.
eng_Latn I am determined I will not look up.
eng_Latn they were all seated and busy
eng_Latn but afterwards, about how men make offers.
eng_Latn to get back to the spring
eng_Latn I found myself out in public, in the middle of the match
eng_Latn something just bust in her.
eng_Latn I'll tell you one thing
eng_Latn on his last visit this had struck him
eng_Latn didn't wake up.
eng_Latn the state of his mind is as clear and decided
eng_Latn he had to stoop quickly to catch it.
eng_Latn for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter
eng_Latn by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts
eng_Latn the whole army desired to do so.
eng_Latn it belongs to him.
eng_Latn I ll rub him out and start again.
eng_Latn that you were to go on.
eng_Latn then, when they had passed
eng_Latn but somehow all he succeeded in doing was having her back in his arms
eng_Latn it was certain that he would rise to the greatest heights of his profession.
eng_Latn only 16% of females could do it.
eng_Latn but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain.
eng_Latn sped off toward the castle
eng_Latn came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied by two hussars.
eng_Latn I was the first to pitch on you.
eng_Latn may I thank the forty six people
eng_Latn sat down by it.
eng_Latn in order to postpone their arrival.
eng_Latn since everything that could possibly be done toaid him was already being done.
eng_Latn but she did not fear her competitors.
eng_Latn I've decided to let you live.
eng_Latn ruining my death!
eng_Latn each of her fingers had a migraine headache and the daylight had begun to take on
eng_Latn she took a few steps after me.
eng_Latn Ohh It's no good Dog. I ll never be a good jumper.
eng_Latn asked him what he had seen in her that he did not include her in the number of the others
eng_Latn that would be a mistake.
eng_Latn that you intend breakfasting with me
eng_Latn I have nothing for you to do.
eng_Latn I assured him that this whole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better female _Yahoos_ could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.
eng_Latn crying in a hoarse sort of screech
eng_Latn Keep going Pug...
eng_Latn trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast
eng_Latn he bought himself a very large lunch
eng_Latn paused to note if by any chance any one had observed her, now looked cautiously about
eng_Latn It's a great mystery....like aliens...or sea monsters...or alien sea monsters.Oo Oh
eng_Latn moved a few steps, and again stopped.
eng_Latn the shadow of someone she had never met.
eng_Latn but held his tongue.
eng_Latn Dog, do you like horrible hairyspiders?
eng_Latn kept her hand drawn through his arm.
eng_Latn though there seemed no chance
eng_Latn but he's too crazy witty for my sanity.
eng_Latn for so I translate the word _lyhannh_
eng_Latn I'll never be ready.
eng_Latn the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight
eng_Latn so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures.
eng_Latn We will split up to search.
eng_Latn if I do not knock them head over heels
eng_Latn for no one had died up till then
eng_Latn I'm not one for running away from a challenge.
eng_Latn lake someone as you can trust.
eng_Latn but keep your eyes off me,
eng_Latn I shall kill myself, because I loathe everything!
eng_Latn not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears.
eng_Latn there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday
eng_Latn but it could have led to very serious consequences.
eng_Latn We never run Princess, though we do like walkies.
eng_Latn suddenly everything was absolutely clear.
eng_Latn maybe there was a corpse lying upstairs in the empty house.
eng_Latn he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road side
eng_Latn since I have you to help me.
eng_Latn And the Princess and the dragon renamed the castle Happy Castle because that was what it was, and lived happily ever after
eng_Latn made no offer to leave the room
eng_Latn in spite of the fact that he had made such drastic resolutions in regard to
eng_Latn but she stopped herself.
eng_Latn but I can't allow the inmates to run this prison.
eng_Latn you must accept it.
eng_Latn his lips were smiling.
eng_Latn I passed the barber's shop.
eng_Latn has cast a gloom over the county.
eng_Latn but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.
eng_Latn their father tried to dissuade them.
eng_Latn e, who is under some obligation to me
eng_Latn Every year, to Chedder orWensleydale or a fishing village in Cornwall.
eng_Latn Umm Madrigals... Maple Syrup..Aah. Magic!
eng_Latn I must have bruised my ribs when the plane came in.
eng_Latn it has in it a certain diffidence.
eng_Latn but sadder, without his gentleness.
eng_Latn Wah! It's going to break.
eng_Latn I wonder if I could come and see you?
eng_Latn by him I was recommended to several patients.
eng_Latn what I thought!
eng_Latn if she didn't get there soon she was going to stain her dress.
eng_Latn Hellooo.
eng_Latn that is, the gentleman who has just gone appears to have an immoderate sense of humour.
eng_Latn twenty three years ago
eng_Latn he stopped the third division
eng_Latn but held his tongue.
eng_Latn I'd never wanted to lead the pack.
eng_Latn he was soaring upward.
eng_Latn Are you Little Bad Wolves - friendsof the Big Bad Wolf?
eng_Latn but when communication is established they fall silent.
eng_Latn Who s that calling me a huge, hairy hideous creature?
eng_Latn I don't suppose I have ever seen her before.
eng_Latn I was and shut the door behind me.
eng_Latn for a last look at the house.
eng_Latn he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color
eng_Latn then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.
eng_Latn How about this Dog?
eng_Latn with almost a quaking sense of adventure.
eng_Latn but suddenly all heads were bared
eng_Latn it is past my power.
eng_Latn which he was to explain with this listof answers
eng_Latn I obeyed him to the letter.
eng_Latn until that was done
eng_Latn it was certain that he would rise to the greatest heights of his profession.
eng_Latn I am so tranquil and happy now.
eng_Latn Then perhaps I could share some of my poetry?
eng_Latn he came out into an open place opposite the village
eng_Latn I felt a tiny bit better, too.
eng_Latn I'd shoot 'em for dog feed first.
eng_Latn the message hidden in the beauty of words.
eng_Latn he leaned over her.
eng_Latn there's enough of that sort of talk.
eng_Latn I told him to take the cup with me
eng_Latn I could not find one.
eng_Latn they walked on very lovingly together.
eng_Latn horror struck by his own daring
eng_Latn suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed stare
eng_Latn but I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.
eng_Latn there was that little pucker between her eyes again.
eng_Latn but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate.
eng_Latn I never have told her that I loved her
eng_Latn I know what I'll do.
eng_Latn a perpetual suspicious conjecture that the views entertained of him were not to his advantage
eng_Latn all of them smelling chicken.
eng_Latn I'm looking for the answers to life s big questions Dog.
eng_Latn I fastened my door and glanced round for the bed.
eng_Latn Come on you lot. If you behave I ll tell you a mice bedtime story.
eng_Latn I will work harder.
eng_Latn Pug, where did you go?
eng_Latn accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.
eng_Latn I was the one she said yes to.
eng_Latn How about Pigs In Blankets ?
eng_Latn the mysterious chain that links one thing to another,
eng_Latn so it was not long before they were stripped
eng_Latn stay behind to scrape tubeworms off the desks.
eng_Latn wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground.
eng_Latn that could have encouraged him to reveal to me
eng_Latn you came out of your mother's womb without a government
eng_Latn nothing was left.
eng_Latn soundlessly let go her breath.
eng_Latn I had not deceived him, though, not for a moment.
eng_Latn I thought he would help me.
eng_Latn but I so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me
eng_Latn that it was much distorted and discoloured.
eng_Latn for she hasn't the sense of a guinea hen.
eng_Latn she braided her long hair
eng_Latn to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases.
eng_Latn littered with plans and papers, a few chairs
eng_Latn this time acting a werewolf.
eng_Latn but a minute or two later, when he and the general had left the villa
eng_Latn he'd explained when I'd flipped out.
eng_Latn that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.
eng_Latn But most of and best of all...
eng_Latn a bit of love from someone!
eng_Latn after the things he's seen, it's not surprising.
eng_Latn like a slender, vibrating feeler of that progress waiting outside for a moment of peace
eng_Latn on which small trenches had been dug
eng_Latn I dare not insist,
eng_Latn having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities.
eng_Latn his mother came to him one afternoon with a very peculiar proposition for her.
eng_Latn together they buried the empty coffin.
eng_Latn they were stopped by no one.
eng_Latn I've abandoned romanticism
eng_Latn the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing.
eng_Latn I think I'm gonna be sick.
eng_Latn I never said I was
eng_Latn the more's the pity!
eng_Latn she loves me that way, too.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! Yes I have.
eng_Latn Pug didn t mean we had hot dogs. He meant..
eng_Latn you tell them so, and that they must stop this
eng_Latn I was researching a new edition of my book but now seem to be lost.
eng_Latn it is time for me to go.
eng_Latn she would not think about them
eng_Latn SNIFFING A BOOK.
eng_Latn but they were not at all tired.
eng_Latn Quite right. It's so strong that you don t need to guard it any more.
eng_Latn here is the door where the sentry stands.
eng_Latn enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
eng_Latn but he said it as quietly and respectfully
eng_Latn I did the same with my waistcoat
eng_Latn I was the monster that dwells in somewhere.
eng_Latn he had met so many idiots in the course of his life!
eng_Latn I hate to wait
eng_Latn found he had a fancy for it.
eng_Latn so it was not long before they were stripped
eng_Latn various schemes to enjoy one another's society.
eng_Latn Except nuffing grows under that bridge.
eng_Latn where a door stood open onto the landing.
eng_Latn I'm over here!
eng_Latn it seemed incredible that anyone should make love to her.
eng_Latn Would you like me to do that,Janice?
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and stand up.
eng_Latn if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger
eng_Latn together with a date.
eng_Latn hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.
eng_Latn it would be nice having a husband who didn't think me a silly fool and expect me to tell lies and
eng_Latn fell prostrate on the ground.
eng_Latn if it be accompanied by practice.
eng_Latn my waist and arms I measured myself.
eng_Latn where he promptly came across and aide de camp of his acquaintance and dropped into conversation with him about an actress and her protector.
eng_Latn her soul lives in the body of this demon.
eng_Latn had stated quite clearly that
eng_Latn I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself
eng_Latn I am not trying to egg you on.
eng_Latn or else I must run round to the porter's lodge.
eng_Latn where a hand grenade was fastened to the belt
eng_Latn took her hand again.
eng_Latn in everything imposingly beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic.
eng_Latn if you have not received any letters from the count, we have received one.
eng_Latn Have you seen a hero looking forbrave companions?
eng_Latn until she took the phone off the hook.
eng_Latn I held out my hand
eng_Latn I was reading a book to night, to wile the time away
eng_Latn that he would place himself at the head of the army
eng_Latn After that dragon!
eng_Latn but certainly to take pleasure in talking to them.
eng_Latn I doubt it.
eng_Latn shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it.
eng_Latn his mother had sent them three hundred francs which he had no longer expected
eng_Latn as if the child were the first that had ever been gotten upon the earth.
eng_Latn I would not have you suffer half what I have done!
eng_Latn when I was nearly four that I suddenly realized that we owned a dog.
eng_Latn she was as though deprived of the power to think.
eng_Latn I'm being brave today and being brave isn t easy.
eng_Latn was a very great lady.
eng_Latn he ought to be in bed, under the hands of a doctor.
eng_Latn I am very glad I did think of her.
eng_Latn rolling his eyes slightly.
eng_Latn Now I know how to fix my see-saw. Bookshop mices!
eng_Latn I have argued it myself.
eng_Latn I am very glad, said the prince.
eng_Latn if you would attend.
eng_Latn Thou hast seen nothing yet. Are you ready for a leap of faith?
eng_Latn I want to be there when every one suddenly understands what it has all been for.
eng_Latn you were always somewhere
eng_Latn but the stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal flight, with added fleetness.
eng_Latn his pounding with the flat of his hand on her bedroom door.
eng_Latn but relatively of such was their nature.
eng_Latn but, like most of her observations
eng_Latn Follow that Kraken!
eng_Latn I have truly pointed out to you and in allhelpfulness the only way the only way
eng_Latn her mouth tightened like an overwound spring.
eng_Latn all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife's knitting needle.
eng_Latn there was an aged goat lying against the open back kitchen door.
eng_Latn felt a pang
eng_Latn he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.
eng_Latn who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to
eng_Latn treading silently across the springy new mown lawn
eng_Latn that loneliness which was for both of them the truth about things.
eng_Latn I think I know who that one's from
eng_Latn his pipe being by this time smoked out
eng_Latn I am afraid I won't have time, he said finally.
eng_Latn a high and holy person like that looked on it as an honour!
eng_Latn she would keep house for him
eng_Latn that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA.
eng_Latn I was and shut the door behind me.
eng_Latn voice of distress quickly thinned away
eng_Latn I am going right ahead.
eng_Latn one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love
eng_Latn so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters
eng_Latn but as it is of no great consequence
eng_Latn all cooked and eaten that very evening.
eng_Latn there are odds and ends upon the ground.
eng_Latn ..I love books that tell me all about the wonders of.....
eng_Latn Er..yes Pug. About that...
eng_Latn burying him in dark, damp compost
eng_Latn this is not the face she knew
eng_Latn he had seen the body of the commander
eng_Latn but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,
eng_Latn you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.
eng_Latn I can't bear to hear about it.
eng_Latn I wonder what people did beforeelectric lights and torch batteries were invented?
eng_Latn even though he had not believed in it till then.
eng_Latn with a grip that almost made me cry out
eng_Latn I put my left hand in his
eng_Latn I have the misfortune, to have been deceived in my married life,
eng_Latn its where he ought to be
eng_Latn but his voice went on as easily as though he had not marked it.
eng_Latn in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices
eng_Latn he despaired of being able to solve the problem of what poetry is and what truth is and fell into a deep dejection.
eng_Latn regretting their friend's flow of cleverness.
eng_Latn vegetables for sale amongst daggers, and carpets displayed alongside tobacco.
eng_Latn realized with a shock that he was an old man
eng_Latn brought my heart into my mouth
eng_Latn Don t worry Pug. I can soon drawyou back again. (To Dog) What does he look like?
eng_Latn Pug, what are you...doing in your den today?
eng_Latn there were no witnesses.
eng_Latn I should be glad to have change of this five pound note.
eng_Latn without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch.
eng_Latn I am sure it was not his fault.
eng_Latn that I shall perhaps never use!
eng_Latn but he thought not of hunger at such a moment
eng_Latn I may not marry you, either. I don't know.
eng_Latn I know, ma'am.
eng_Latn Neither. These burgers are huge.
eng_Latn the doors were propped open to let in the balmy air.
eng_Latn alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart, and somade him run.
eng_Latn he's not a hero!
eng_Latn see if you can manage to tell me the truth.
eng_Latn seized each other's hands, kissing them and pulling them away
eng_Latn strewing some heath under me
eng_Latn I looked straight ahead.
eng_Latn I know you need not
eng_Latn when he heard it yet again.
eng_Latn I hated the thing that was hurting her.
eng_Latn I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can.
eng_Latn though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than suspects that the joke is at nobody's expense but his own.
eng_Latn Camille s Camouflage Conundrum
eng_Latn You can read Pug?
eng_Latn I saw him this morning without pack saddle or harness of any sort
eng_Latn but he never received the response he longed for
eng_Latn his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress.
eng_Latn her agitation now was amazing.
eng_Latn together they buried the empty coffin.
eng_Latn on the night when I was born, and saw my dear mama.
eng_Latn Some of the words may be a bit wobbly but I ll do my best.
eng_Latn will reach the age of sixteen
eng_Latn the town lies on the western point
eng_Latn that she had shared the grief of the family
eng_Latn I will do my best.
eng_Latn before she disappeared.
eng_Latn It was fun. That was a very exciting story.
eng_Latn I suppose it spends all year making up the next one.
eng_Latn to engulf himself with her.
eng_Latn I'll believe I'll get it.
eng_Latn I left my new rod and the rest of the fishing tackle in my bedroom.
eng_Latn I think you should eat something, I disagreed.
eng_Latn at length permitted me to go.
eng_Latn but I positively haven't another moment now.
eng_Latn I fell asleep to the scent of my wolf.
eng_Latn to see that no one was concealed
eng_Latn he wandered off in the direction of his room
eng_Latn but this time he had a girl with him.
eng_Latn peered over the wall to the broad smooth plain of cement.
eng_Latn I know what I'll do.
eng_Latn I was never consulted.
eng_Latn warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail.
eng_Latn if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat.
eng_Latn because we've got to win today
eng_Latn was holding his wand ready.
eng_Latn turned her face to the wall
eng_Latn perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it.
eng_Latn where a hand grenade was fastened to the belt
eng_Latn every sense alert
eng_Latn It's a real robot dog, Dog!
eng_Latn I stare at her
eng_Latn Oh no! It's run out!
eng_Latn but I strongly advise you to pack him off tomorrow.
eng_Latn but not to one who does not
eng_Latn Hmmm!
eng_Latn I should just kill him now.
eng_Latn to go through the waking town from end to end without a check in the speed a mass of heavy,
eng_Latn she recalled his composure, and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits.
eng_Latn I questioned her afterward, and she told me they didn't discuss anything in particular.
eng_Latn then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants
eng_Latn then my blood crept cold through my veins.
eng_Latn Oh This IS a very long road.
eng_Latn I went in and the door closed behind me.
eng_Latn I gritted my teeth and tried to get my head straight.
eng_Latn I know I shouldn't speak to you
eng_Latn bidding us keep quiet making any noise.
eng_Latn I have no money to pay my bill
eng_Latn the little church had been so full before.
eng_Latn but a lack of vital force, of what is called heart,
eng_Latn he was hopeful that they could be tamed.
eng_Latn I had a sudden desperate yearning to get off with her.
eng_Latn I lost at least two years of my life
eng_Latn my mouth dry.
eng_Latn of whom he had heard much
eng_Latn the noise of the door with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased
eng_Latn taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
eng_Latn A great magician never says how it's done!
eng_Latn never had one moment of happiness together.
eng_Latn I didn't see anything either
eng_Latn brought him to the grave!
eng_Latn in excuse for leaning down her face
eng_Latn than I should be for not wanting a leg or an arm
eng_Latn I read the note
eng_Latn still lingered about the same spot.
eng_Latn but nobody spoke.
eng_Latn in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
eng_Latn like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong.
eng_Latn was in danger
eng_Latn it is no sin to remember a grief.
eng_Latn Everyone has to be somewhere Granny.
eng_Latn I declare Cow the clear winner of the Hey-On-Diddle High Jump with a new world record of two hundred and fifty thousand miles!
eng_Latn Yikes! What is it?
eng_Latn What s the matter Dog?
eng_Latn I am feeling something which is perhaps foolish and wrong
eng_Latn in the slow dragging ages
eng_Latn but valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at his post.
eng_Latn collecting together a gang of workers to help him, principally of his own family, became a partner in the cattle yard.
eng_Latn but the fee was twenty five bucks.
eng_Latn That is why no one s allowed on my bridge!
eng_Latn I had said it aloud.
eng_Latn I've been relieved.
eng_Latn the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past!
eng_Latn I'll think the thing over
eng_Latn she still didn't put pen to paper.
eng_Latn I did the work I was fit for.
eng_Latn but determined, when he had found it out, to give them a good thrashing, as he always did on such occasions.
eng_Latn I hesitated, then turned left
eng_Latn a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody
eng_Latn Maybe Pug and I could help you.
eng_Latn before giving his signature he must give a rather strong admonition.
eng_Latn but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind.
eng_Latn I didn't expect to see you again.
eng_Latn I cut the page right out of the book.
eng_Latn taught those who were interested how to dance his national dances
eng_Latn YOU don't like trouble and danger.
eng_Latn I will remember it, said the young man
eng_Latn never been the same since.
eng_Latn his son, and the boy's tutor
eng_Latn less to sleep than to rest his limbs, cramped with cold and study.
eng_Latn he had been engaged in two affairs of the utmost importance
eng_Latn never been the same since.
eng_Latn he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse.
eng_Latn reflected that he might have a cold.
eng_Latn this is not the face she knew
eng_Latn I had raised my hat
eng_Latn but he held her back.
eng_Latn I just love your roses
eng_Latn Let the naughty bookshop laugh all they like...
eng_Latn I turned her gently over
eng_Latn when everyone was just confused and scared?
eng_Latn my son shall take it and bear it.
eng_Latn I wonder why?
eng_Latn I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
eng_Latn that were never said of me
eng_Latn I was glad she had rung up
eng_Latn I have truly pointed out to you and in allhelpfulness the only way the only way
eng_Latn so the suggestion of a captured bundle
eng_Latn I can see how it might work.
eng_Latn I wandered to the table beside the bed. I picked up the book.
eng_Latn I thought he would help me.
eng_Latn but I felt disinclined to go and look at them
eng_Latn Visitors! How marvelous. And what can I do for you?
eng_Latn as neither heaven has created nor hell seen any that can daunt or intimidate me,
eng_Latn We were ready to give up but then we found a catapulty way over the thorns .
eng_Latn but the warm, chlorinated taste of the water made his stomach turn.
eng_Latn he stopped and turned about and watched it until it disappeared.
eng_Latn I gave my witness. I have no more business here.
eng_Latn the chauffeur drove on.
eng_Latn then quickly tiptoe back towards the front door.
eng_Latn that's the stroke to sweep the stakes!
eng_Latn that at its close I seemed to have been with him for a much longer time.
eng_Latn he passed several as being too crowded
eng_Latn but it was only to place himself in a situation
eng_Latn caused her to look round.
eng_Latn but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.
eng_Latn but I felt disinclined to go and look at them
eng_Latn because I loved you best.
eng_Latn that had left both walls and floor soaking wet.
eng_Latn get behind the door
eng_Latn but I am looking for a man of feeling and education.
eng_Latn I'll pay you for it?
eng_Latn My Robot.
eng_Latn in fairly good training
eng_Latn she didn't even stir as I left.
eng_Latn Let's find the others!
eng_Latn attracted the best qualified gluttons from all along the coast.
eng_Latn he placed his hat over his heart, tremulous and dignified
eng_Latn and the abbe accompanied him to the door
eng_Latn I was horrified.
eng_Latn two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.
eng_Latn You re safe now little mouse.
eng_Latn I got the paper and read it yesterday.
eng_Latn get the blouses half in large size, half in medium.
eng_Latn without thinking beyond the immediate cause
eng_Latn I don't really remember.
eng_Latn NEWEverything was so clear.
eng_Latn the sound of their voices, and what they were saying, made him change his mind.
eng_Latn but never will I lean on a staff again.
eng_Latn later at her request was about to writehis uncle
eng_Latn he stopped the others.
eng_Latn this is not a voice she ever heard.
eng_Latn his body was like a hunted animal fleeing before its captors.
eng_Latn The Captains Hat.
eng_Latn then plumped down in a chair by the table.
eng_Latn the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction.
eng_Latn I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner time in drawing some little sketches for her use.
eng_Latn he was the projection of what his son would be like in thirty years.
eng_Latn but you cannot have heard me.
eng_Latn if you like.
eng_Latn for in truth you are to blame for their not wanting to hear you.
eng_Latn but as an approver,she was truly welcome.
eng_Latn he got gingerly to his feet
eng_Latn MY granny - Granny Pug!
eng_Latn but the world is full of knives just lying around waiting to be picked up.
eng_Latn if anyone knew the reason for the suicide.
eng_Latn but seeing him come pale, worn, and haggard
eng_Latn there was no want of foresight.
eng_Latn for the matter concerned his mother.
eng_Latn especially if one's friends were invariably fit for any function they desired to undertake!
eng_Latn surrounding his house
eng_Latn take this door!
eng_Latn Bedbugs...Bedpans..Aah..Bedtime stories!
eng_Latn that he had been an assiduous participant in the annual competition
eng_Latn silence on both sides.
eng_Latn but recommended me to a friend of his, to bear me company thither.
eng_Latn next day at two in the afternoon they arrived at the cave
eng_Latn I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor heard
eng_Latn every thing I've got in the world.
eng_Latn the downpour of rain, redoubled in its spite, became furious.
eng_Latn The North Pole!
eng_Latn if he wanted a handy fellow
eng_Latn having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner
eng_Latn on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill.
eng_Latn obliged him to hurry away as soon as he had satisfied the demands of the other.
eng_Latn inside and outside.
eng_Latn saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back at him in the darkness
eng_Latn I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.
eng_Latn Out you get then ... we ll need to bake it in this tin!
eng_Latn that sad past, which had been very niggardly of joy for her
eng_Latn farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls
eng_Latn dipped the pen in the standish again
eng_Latn I only hope they won't make me!
eng_Latn he very much doubted whether she understood exactly what she felt for him.
eng_Latn a single minute later he was dressed
eng_Latn I tried to feel my heart, to find it
eng_Latn law is law.
eng_Latn if readers would only take this advice.
eng_Latn pushed open the front door.
eng_Latn I must look about for a wife for him.
eng_Latn we stayed behind
eng_Latn met to enter upon a painful conversation
eng_Latn I heard a little gasp and I looked up.
eng_Latn from ever wishing for that death which to day you so much dread!
eng_Latn the bunny costume
eng_Latn as many more to buy jewels to lure her
eng_Latn I must show it you some day or other.
eng_Latn I wanted to,
eng_Latn I-I do.
eng_Latn I wondered where I d put it!
eng_Latn I haven't heard a word from him since he was here.
eng_Latn so everything will be all right.
eng_Latn to go to his punishment
eng_Latn the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor.
eng_Latn as it seemed impossible to restrain him
eng_Latn predicked the whole
eng_Latn of which he was the centre.
eng_Latn I didn't waste much attention on it.
eng_Latn ostracized as a chicken thief.
eng_Latn he drew the glove from his shapely white hand
eng_Latn in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth.
eng_Latn one not to be bothered with at this time.
eng_Latn but it bent in an arc from his hand
eng_Latn I love you, and I don't care for anything,
eng_Latn without even knowing she loved it
eng_Latn but for a pretty young woman like you it's early days for that house of charity.
eng_Latn a very pleasing young woman.
eng_Latn I should like to know with whomshe is living
eng_Latn which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the time
eng_Latn the work of a prankster
eng_Latn I fell asleep to the scent of my wolf.
eng_Latn but finding it impossible
eng_Latn But who is making it?
eng_Latn suddenly, with a crunching noise
eng_Latn she sont me to drive you.
eng_Latn I was dressed up as a doggy biscuit to celebrate National Doggy Biscuit Day and now the naughty bookshop mice want to eat me!
eng_Latn A corridor!
eng_Latn Here I am!
eng_Latn unless he cut her off entirely.
eng_Latn I can't go out otherwise than masked.
eng_Latn watching carefully as the three of them chose which table to sit at.
eng_Latn Dog and Pug?
eng_Latn had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius
eng_Latn why should she who is loved for her beauty part
eng_Latn feeling, with true delicacy
eng_Latn I don' wanna go back there no more'I'm tar'd.
eng_Latn Give it here!
eng_Latn the end of which is still in suspense
eng_Latn I do not believe.
eng_Latn I no longer suffer.
eng_Latn he discovered that the paving continued.
eng_Latn without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot.
eng_Latn I'd been expecting it to be difficult.
eng_Latn it would require two horses.
eng_Latn today, to believe that the past is unalterable.
eng_Latn This is a book by...
eng_Latn I'll think the thing over
eng_Latn expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least
eng_Latn I like rudeness a great deal better than flattery.
eng_Latn then broke for five minutes, then gave it again.
eng_Latn that a fox had been found, and the whole pack, joining together
eng_Latn there was nothing shameful.
eng_Latn secure in the faith that his counsel may beable to extract him safely from this
eng_Latn it wasn't long before the war was over
eng_Latn keep the weather of the island.
eng_Latn but when I did it I can't in the least remember.
eng_Latn Bow Wowser!
eng_Latn I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
eng_Latn will be curious and able enough to supply my defects.
eng_Latn raw from the chafing of the iron.
eng_Latn he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth.
eng_Latn held her tightly.
eng_Latn on the night when I was born, and saw my dear mama.
eng_Latn it halted a few yards away from him.
eng_Latn I asked her for tea
eng_Latn I think he's pretty unhappy, and I know I am!
eng_Latn then fell to biting and tearing the rest
eng_Latn to bend them the wrong way was intolerable.
eng_Latn for any job of work where there wasn't valuable consideration to be gained.
eng_Latn will reach the age of sixteen
eng_Latn as if it knew it was perfectly safe.
eng_Latn so that he might have seized her twice over
eng_Latn then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
eng_Latn to be champions always ready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour, conduct, and fidelity.
eng_Latn his eyes fixed on the house.
eng_Latn I have come here with no object except to help him.
eng_Latn have pages and everything.
eng_Latn she received an evasive answer.
eng_Latn I stood upon the hearth rug
eng_Latn lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl.
eng_Latn I memorized her face one last time
eng_Latn but she managed it in the end.
eng_Latn for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable.
eng_Latn I want you think of aspecial word that makes you feel happy - trying to see it in your mind.
eng_Latn I would love to believe that.
eng_Latn e, who is under some obligation to me
eng_Latn dived under his own desk
eng_Latn heard of or saw this.
eng_Latn I'm telling him to come to dinner.
eng_Latn spurring his mare was passing them without stopping
eng_Latn tomorrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it.
eng_Latn I could not stand it any longer.
eng_Latn I felt there was something between us.
eng_Latn Fit as a flea Dog.I thought riding my new skateboard would be easy...
eng_Latn my life will be bitter without you.
eng_Latn that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal
eng_Latn I was perfectly bewildered.
eng_Latn I shall be ready to go tomorrow,' he said.
eng_Latn you two need to run.
eng_Latn without even taking the trouble to tear it up.
eng_Latn I have a son too
eng_Latn Ooh Oh How curious.
eng_Latn the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy
eng_Latn I'm going to look at the oak.
eng_Latn I will reflect.
eng_Latn I shall kill myself, but first of all that cur.
eng_Latn I'll see what I can do.
eng_Latn if they were fortunate in choosing their sisters in law!
eng_Latn hurrying along the corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go
eng_Latn as though it had run headlong into a brick wall.
eng_Latn how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea
eng_Latn who, in something of fear, stopped talking.
eng_Latn I am unhappy enough as it is!
eng_Latn I never expected you so soon, he said.
eng_Latn your wife won't allow it!
eng_Latn I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them.
eng_Latn for he led me back into the house
eng_Latn it was trivial
eng_Latn but upon the accident that happened to the emperor's horse, they alighted, and came near his person
eng_Latn Meow
eng_Latn I love life.
eng_Latn I wasn't born a compassionless shrew.
eng_Latn he selected a mare from the drove
eng_Latn Thank-you Dog and Pug for showing me how to make new friends.
eng_Latn This mighty pile of pillows made for a happy landing!
eng_Latn when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander's stirrup, almost leaning against him.
eng_Latn that at its close I seemed to have been with him for a much longer time.
eng_Latn I shook my head and turned away.
eng_Latn yet nevertheless, as the law and thechurch see it, guilty of sin and crime.
eng_Latn I will tell you everything when I see you.
eng_Latn he muttered, almost embarrassed.
eng_Latn I didn't ask her forgiveness.
eng_Latn to hide the star at his neck and the garter at his knee.
eng_Latn the fire was beautiful
eng_Latn together with a checkered blue and white flannel skirt
eng_Latn I had to work.
eng_Latn but he, too, had jet black hair.
eng_Latn was already more than she was meant to carry.
eng_Latn was unable to dissuade him.
eng_Latn as she saw him, she staggered forward, and half fell into his outstretched arms.
eng_Latn from the boughs of the trees
eng_Latn Ta-dah! Look what I made!
eng_Latn the young wife of an elderly man of fortune here.
eng_Latn I have no long gun to reach ye.
eng_Latn but we won't go into that.
eng_Latn passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close ranked trees.
eng_Latn was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.
eng_Latn I am sure the moon must enjoy it.
eng_Latn I owed my life to you
eng_Latn his voice rose a little
eng_Latn but such was not the squire's pleasure
eng_Latn I had quite made up my mind
eng_Latn was so daring and such a villain
eng_Latn she assures me
eng_Latn she realized that something had changed in the world.
eng_Latn between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going
eng_Latn I crossed the field with them flanking me.
eng_Latn I could draw nothing further from him
eng_Latn she sat down
eng_Latn he knew that sooner or later he would step across it
eng_Latn Dog!
eng_Latn was nearly died of fright.
eng_Latn for all men should wait on one another.
eng_Latn something that was too impenetrable for ultrasounds, too tough for needles.
eng_Latn you have scarcely tasted since you began tea.
eng_Latn why, then the pack saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this gentleman has said.
eng_Latn boiling him for a whole day over a slow fire
eng_Latn laying a soiled and unopened letter before him
eng_Latn he went to look for him.
eng_Latn I m... over the moon!
eng_Latn instead of free boarders.
eng_Latn I was too thirsty.
eng_Latn beat down his guard a
eng_Latn as the reader chooses to consider it upon her relations with her husband
eng_Latn he was hopeful that they could be tamed.
eng_Latn I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet.
eng_Latn the whole countryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing
eng_Latn I was your equal at eighteen quite your equal.
eng_Latn but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long
eng_Latn but when I get married, it will be forever.
eng_Latn I am more than fairly well off
eng_Latn I can't believe you missed the game last night just to watch somebody sleep
eng_Latn They ain t me treasure, you bilge-loving barnacle!
eng_Latn for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine!
eng_Latn was alien to the existence of his sons
eng_Latn should he retreat after going so far?
eng_Latn That sounds kanga-rude!
eng_Latn I don't care why the demons ran.
eng_Latn I didn't even think about it.
eng_Latn Bookshops mices!
eng_Latn it was damp, somber, and sad.
eng_Latn he provincial home again he would settle in some provincial town as a general practitioner
eng_Latn that they could not stand this existence, and that they would have to alter it.
eng_Latn seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number
eng_Latn how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him
eng_Latn We ll help you Granny! I ve never ridden an ant before.
eng_Latn but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us.
eng_Latn as it is so near, and to save the trouble of undressing and dressing again
eng_Latn yet I could not strike above sixteen keys.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! I know what to do Dog.This is a job for Mrs Honey Bunny!
eng_Latn he seated himself in the boat and began rowing towards the harbour's mouth.
eng_Latn there is no wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope
eng_Latn as though it had run headlong into a brick wall.
eng_Latn or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either side.
eng_Latn my son shall take it and bear it.
eng_Latn were steadiness and diligence.
eng_Latn but he felt his resolution checked by despairing resentment.
eng_Latn but we won't go into that.
eng_Latn Is it Commander Action?
eng_Latn the skin was white and clear.
eng_Latn I might make something out of this if I handled it properly.
eng_Latn the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from destruction.
eng_Latn I do think it would be better to wait, said the latter.
eng_Latn let us remember this, in time.
eng_Latn it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.
eng_Latn Right boys - lets have lunch!
eng_Latn who answered him.
eng_Latn did her best to fathom the noble art of prose composition as these masters practised it.
eng_Latn she stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path.
eng_Latn only his face is visible now.
eng_Latn his face in her hair
eng_Latn I wish I could go on a magical quest.
eng_Latn Us!
eng_Latn Perhaps you could do with a little help?
eng_Latn but now it held the shape of footprints.
eng_Latn until the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well
eng_Latn replaced by neat green fields
eng_Latn they followed their chaperones, arm in arm, into the ballroom
eng_Latn to have another think.
eng_Latn of which he was the centre.
eng_Latn it was so reasoned, incisive, and well written
eng_Latn it was to invite death
eng_Latn still wearing the insignia of his rank, and shut the door.
eng_Latn I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin
eng_Latn despite the fact that the only affinity between the two was their addiction to chess
eng_Latn gnomes all over the garden.
eng_Latn ...I love books that show me a new way to see something I see all the time.
eng_Latn where tea was prepared
eng_Latn whose life is written by these fingers.
eng_Latn had come home.
eng_Latn that you may see how rational I am grown.
eng_Latn Oooh, that felt good.Oh.ooh
eng_Latn there was nothing shameful.
eng_Latn he stopped the others.
eng_Latn you can whistle for the money.
eng_Latn because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations
eng_Latn he took the blow bravely
eng_Latn he broke out into a sweat.
eng_Latn I dare say she was very much attached to him.
eng_Latn maybe she went to the bathroom or something?
eng_Latn then removed his rifle from his shoulder.
eng_Latn for you to go on fighting with
eng_Latn I put back the receiver.
eng_Latn it was sport for him.
eng_Latn It's a princess Pug. You like princesses.
eng_Latn he said coldly
eng_Latn but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue.
eng_Latn putting the boy in his charge
eng_Latn it can become confused, thrown off the track, and defeated.
eng_Latn as though he were going to pick something up.
eng_Latn I hope that he will not consent to it.
eng_Latn I just remembered that today's my birthday.
eng_Latn unwilling to let them see that they had been observed.
eng_Latn we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.
eng_Latn but overnight the house had plunged into a crisis of senility.
eng_Latn dressed in shoes and light summer trousers.
eng_Latn he cried shrilly.
eng_Latn but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation.
eng_Latn I only hope they won't make me!
eng_Latn I don't want you to do anything
eng_Latn the fellow shall be in my power before another day is past!
eng_Latn it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.
eng_Latn but my daughter is so young
eng_Latn the very place in which she had been brought up
eng_Latn he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air
eng_Latn four had made good their footing inside our defences
eng_Latn have pages and everything.
eng_Latn allthe officers, except five, were either dead or captured.
eng_Latn breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory
eng_Latn he discovered that the paving continued.
eng_Latn shut yourself up again.
eng_Latn with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection.
eng_Latn Orion...
eng_Latn the figure almost too graceful.
eng_Latn made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions
eng_Latn perhaps, also, she made the mistake of depending too much upon her brother
eng_Latn a most eminent person.
eng_Latn suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face.
eng_Latn unless indeed it be that the victor have lost his own in the combat
eng_Latn I never shall see my pretty darling again.
eng_Latn can be that I am completely in your power.
eng_Latn to look at a famous geranium we had, in the parlour window.
eng_Latn all those who're a thousand times worse than she
eng_Latn he attached himself to the cause of progress and our younger generation from enthusiasm.
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and stand up.
eng_Latn but I will forgive you.
eng_Latn I owns mysef, en I's wuth eight hund'd dollars.
eng_Latn had had by her three sons
eng_Latn I recognized him at glance.
eng_Latn I says, that's what you get for narking ME!
eng_Latn but he soon sighed
eng_Latn Granny Pug s Guide to the World ofthe Weird.
eng_Latn as to leave us here.
eng_Latn many of which stuck in my hands and face.
eng_Latn I was passing, and it struck me that really I wasn't such a bad figure of a man.
eng_Latn as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship
eng_Latn with these words she broke away and hurried off.
eng_Latn he was a widower
eng_Latn but the world is full of knives just lying around waiting to be picked up.
eng_Latn along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street
eng_Latn jeweled with flowers.
eng_Latn I said that we must put off going for three days
eng_Latn the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield
eng_Latn I should forget about it.
eng_Latn he resolutely began the ascent.
eng_Latn I was badly bred.
eng_Latn I want some myself, and I can't bear liqueurs.
eng_Latn but I wish you had.
eng_Latn with a sound mind.
eng_Latn but you have only to search for yourself
eng_Latn Dog loves Books!
eng_Latn one large, fat beetle.
eng_Latn I had something else to do.
eng_Latn I'd better tell you the whole truth.
eng_Latn coming out of the earth
eng_Latn he is a hero!
eng_Latn I know that sounds backward.
eng_Latn they upended it and drank thirstily.
eng_Latn that is so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.
eng_Latn he said and went out, closing the door noiselessly behind him.
eng_Latn swaying slowly from side to side, had drawn nearer to the young woman
eng_Latn just like you said!
eng_Latn until they covered the whole world.
eng_Latn I discovered what it was really made of.
eng_Latn you have a hole in your shirt.
eng_Latn tugging his hand from mine
eng_Latn that it was much distorted and discoloured.
eng_Latn on the contrary
eng_Latn I feel much better now.
eng_Latn but he was careful to hide it under his shirt.
eng_Latn the chances that may come to us on the way.
eng_Latn I appreciate your coming.
eng_Latn though it's a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that.
eng_Latn do not keep me waiting
eng_Latn he pulled up his coat collar
eng_Latn I thought it better to tell you, my dear.
eng_Latn pointing to his mare
eng_Latn when I was called to dinner.
eng_Latn Treasure Chests ... Thermal Vests . Aah.. Fantasy Quests!
eng_Latn pulling at the reins.
eng_Latn which I did for you in the oldendays.
eng_Latn my affectation of walking continually on my two hinder feet.
eng_Latn I wonder how we found Granny Pug?
eng_Latn Gah! Ah Who is it?
eng_Latn but they paused to listen.
eng_Latn his hat with the feather in the band cocked back well on his head.
eng_Latn And a big splodge of red. There. Finished.
eng_Latn I loped through the thick forest toward them.
eng_Latn I sense you also have a most enquiring mind.
eng_Latn Aye aye captain.
eng_Latn took the long horsewhip from its nail.
eng_Latn partly because he liked it best
eng_Latn they went away together
eng_Latn for she hasn't the sense of a guinea hen.
eng_Latn I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.
eng_Latn so he made after him to ask it.
eng_Latn heard of or saw this.
eng_Latn Ohh How curious.
eng_Latn with great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing
eng_Latn I asked as lightly as I could manage.
eng_Latn they both backed into chairs by the fire.
eng_Latn I shouldn't trouble.
eng_Latn went off to guard the river bank
eng_Latn nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman's hand
eng_Latn seven hundred roubles down, and the remaining two thousand three hundred to be paid next day in the town.
eng_Latn How curious. Where are you?
eng_Latn he said coldly
eng_Latn that's as bad to bear.
eng_Latn it nearly made him pass out again.
eng_Latn I wisht I could wait an' not tell you.
eng_Latn it was the way you
eng_Latn with something under their arm
eng_Latn like all men, he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love
eng_Latn being unable to support the agonies I was under
eng_Latn but he was certain it had been done deliberately.
eng_Latn they turned into a dark room they were passing
eng_Latn my servant's coat and my hat?
eng_Latn I got places to go.
eng_Latn but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out, so laboriously framed.
eng_Latn bought herself a pair of espadrilles on the way to the train.
eng_Latn but I can't allow the inmates to run this prison.
eng_Latn or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake.
eng_Latn picked her up and sat her on a flat topped marble pedestal, where her face and his were level.
eng_Latn who used him far worse than before.
eng_Latn by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil
eng_Latn I have no intention of discussing your soul's welfare any further.
eng_Latn I gave myself very good reasons
eng_Latn Tell me about it.
eng_Latn I want to see.
eng_Latn to try if it came up to my own opinion of it
eng_Latn he began to think again about what she had feared.
eng_Latn she made her stay in bed for five days and
eng_Latn having kept this up as long as one would be saying a credo
eng_Latn where a door stood open onto the landing.
eng_Latn the old man is as surly as a dog.
eng_Latn for they were soaked through
eng_Latn I wasted a moment staring at him.
eng_Latn but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear at her devotion and trustfulness
eng_Latn rolled off his broom.
eng_Latn My name is Sancho Panza, and thisis my master Don Quixote, a most noble knight,
eng_Latn tell them what I had seen.
eng_Latn she didn't have to see him.
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and smooth my hair back
eng_Latn that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me
eng_Latn as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear
eng_Latn Oo oo oo T-they are giants!
eng_Latn whom he reposed great confidence
eng_Latn he has ordered me to take him
eng_Latn take this door!
eng_Latn everyone with a red face, you may be certain
eng_Latn but experience had taught him a way of thrusting a cross headed camel
eng_Latn it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your illness, perhaps.
eng_Latn A most en-LIGHTENED idea, Pug.
eng_Latn you are liable to be contradicted.
eng_Latn to sign the contract
eng_Latn I almost feel as if she had.
eng_Latn I want to know why I'm lying for you.
eng_Latn I shut the door again.
eng_Latn Will you help me read to Dog?
eng_Latn that if he the landlord really had no other place for me
eng_Latn I take one last look at myself in the mirror
eng_Latn but she interrupted him to ask something of her mother.
eng_Latn at the risk of being stifled
eng_Latn she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes.
eng_Latn really he only ran a few steps alone.
eng_Latn turned the corner and pushed through the door that led to my own rooms in the east wing.
eng_Latn I think you'll do best to keep your visions to yourself
eng_Latn I turned, and then wished I hadn't.
eng_Latn scrambled into bed with him
eng_Latn he ended up in front of his older son, who during the past few days had barely put in an appearance in the laboratory.
eng_Latn Soggy doggy biscuits! I wanted to lose the boxy bit.
eng_Latn because his hands seemed to have the property of breaking everything they touched.
eng_Latn get the blouses half in large size, half in medium.
eng_Latn but the swooning too was real this time.
eng_Latn I thought would have made me faint.
eng_Latn which if it were the size of a person would weave webs that were stronger that steel
eng_Latn I instantly recognized
eng_Latn no one ever dared go inside
eng_Latn I did not come this way,' I said.
eng_Latn but then she is used to my voice.
eng_Latn This is a CITY of night Dog.
eng_Latn you don't seem to care much.
eng_Latn until she had made a good match.
eng_Latn but lured him back again.
eng_Latn return and tell me.
eng_Latn Quick! To the beach!
eng_Latn even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain.
eng_Latn it was as though her eternal happiness depended on the color of her hangings or the shape of an old chest.
eng_Latn though he had heard hardly anything, understood everything in his own way.
eng_Latn shading his face with his hand.
eng_Latn we have neglected many things.
eng_Latn in the satisfaction of knowing that I have been right in my opinion
eng_Latn but no one discovered that she was blind.
eng_Latn desired I would give him a relation of my travels.
eng_Latn I would have offered you something.
eng_Latn handed down their cursed black flag
eng_Latn Who meet every evening to sing to the moon.
eng_Latn I intend to try.
eng_Latn I hurry out of the restaurant to discover it's started to rain.
eng_Latn so I made some stuff up.
eng_Latn try the wig in front of the looking glass, turn this way and that before the long mirror on the wall.
eng_Latn his honor being engaged in keeping it
eng_Latn which ten thousand other men in the world have.
eng_Latn took the platter of sausages with trembling hands.
eng_Latn he had tried
eng_Latn Blowing
eng_Latn DORIS LOOKS AFTER HER FRIENDS!
eng_Latn almost crumpling beneath the weight of a disapproval she had never known before.
eng_Latn we can get a station wagon, put him in the back, and go on
eng_Latn until that was done
eng_Latn I have it still, in my missal.
eng_Latn I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my provisions
eng_Latn not even a cat.
eng_Latn I'm very sorry about it.
eng_Latn our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered,
eng_Latn knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over.
eng_Latn I must look about for a wife for him.
eng_Latn calling a sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe.
eng_Latn for 14 years I've been a whore for the advertising industry
eng_Latn I wiped it with a lace handkerchief
eng_Latn ran at once to aid them.
eng_Latn I had given him no sign of my occupation.
eng_Latn but no sound disturbed the quiet.
eng_Latn as neither heaven has created nor hell seen any that can daunt or intimidate me,
eng_Latn stickin' out like a tooth.
eng_Latn its where he ought to be
eng_Latn lost his temper
eng_Latn burning under the infernal three o' clock sun
eng_Latn so that he did not think he was going beyond the bounds of condescension, nor, on the other hand, making a mistake, in inviting the young couple.
eng_Latn but she walked on as rapidly as she could.
eng_Latn asked him into the room that had been assigned him.
eng_Latn this is not a voice she ever heard.
eng_Latn grandly into camp
eng_Latn tell me now, dismissing anger and irritation
eng_Latn so I won't complain.
eng_Latn covered with blood
eng_Latn but nobody spoke.
eng_Latn he went panting into the confused and gloomy place where there was barely room to move.
eng_Latn he discovered that the paving continued.
eng_Latn was bitterly unhappy.
eng_Latn I want your permission to save her life.
eng_Latn as we ourselves might have done
eng_Latn but was mortified because no one would understand
eng_Latn but let us walk
eng_Latn sock it to them.
eng_Latn his glance wandered away with the stream
eng_Latn when she sets herself to press a point
eng_Latn You promised us cakes.
eng_Latn I've never seen such incredible white beaches.
eng_Latn but her eyes spoke quite differently.
eng_Latn Oh no. Girls aren t allowed to perform in plays.
eng_Latn see if any of you have begun to learn to spell.
eng_Latn her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge.
eng_Latn I merely followed him round
eng_Latn I'll do both, as soon as I possibly can.
eng_Latn as if he did not mind talking about the affair now.
eng_Latn some unshaven, dirty man, girt with a sword and with a tiny cross embroidered in white cotton on the left breast of a lieutenant's uniform
eng_Latn I wanted to,
eng_Latn or anywhere else ever again.
eng_Latn A portrait of the king ininterpretative dance.
eng_Latn I had a good time tonight.
eng_Latn but mostly they went for five or six.
eng_Latn Come down from there at once younaughty mouse.
eng_Latn And I think we ll have three willing helpers too.
eng_Latn Yes I have.
eng_Latn she lost no time in putting a stop to it.
eng_Latn he had to admit almost been jealous on his wife's account, was the butt of this set.
eng_Latn I had raised my hat
eng_Latn I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take a holt of a snake skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it.
eng_Latn it is a fancy you have taken in your head
eng_Latn when I offered to struggle he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to submit.
eng_Latn sounded shrill and unnatural
eng_Latn then lay on their oars.
eng_Latn I didn't quite hear.
eng_Latn but we're just too scared to say anything.
eng_Latn I mean the poverty, and abandoning her position.
eng_Latn I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave.
eng_Latn you know, I'm not your boss.
eng_Latn if you oppose me in this great stake
eng_Latn but what was very moderate and very transient.
eng_Latn that's on the edge of the grave.
eng_Latn the message hidden in the beauty of words.
eng_Latn I can tell him!
eng_Latn theirbones have turned to stone.
eng_Latn cause those talons hurt.
eng_Latn but he mustn't catch it yet
eng_Latn I shall stay an hour or two willingly.
eng_Latn but she never saw him alone.
eng_Latn If a bit on the slobbery side.
eng_Latn It's mine!
eng_Latn But you re not... as tall as weexpected.
eng_Latn he walked with a slight swing on each leg into the dining room
eng_Latn I ve never seen dogs and bats being friends before.
eng_Latn that no other spiritual aid should be called in.
eng_Latn all dressed in their best.
eng_Latn there is no living being who has not done it.
eng_Latn the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry.
eng_Latn then lowered for the charge.
eng_Latn that is what I call talking to some purpose
eng_Latn horror struck by his own daring
eng_Latn And I'm Billy Barker.
eng_Latn I have nothing for you to do.
eng_Latn This desert is deserted. Where isGranny Pug?
eng_Latn Quickly, we must leave.
eng_Latn And we win...
eng_Latn the lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business.
eng_Latn Now Pug!
eng_Latn then he sank to the earth.
eng_Latn I'm sure you are fond of each other ' er ' very deep down.
eng_Latn I left the car, took a load of gun cotton, and mounted my camel, to push in advance of the force.
eng_Latn he was both seen and heard
eng_Latn the small glow of another fire.
eng_Latn then he raises his eyebrows.
eng_Latn everything seemed asleep
eng_Latn or, in short, vanquish and subdue him
eng_Latn the poor boy was in a state of deep affliction.
eng_Latn but her death shocked me terribly.
eng_Latn when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered
eng_Latn whom he loved as if he were a human being
eng_Latn for nobody here will tell the truth.
eng_Latn who, in something of fear, stopped talking.
eng_Latn it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your illness, perhaps.
eng_Latn It stonkingly well is! Come on!
eng_Latn They are very MICE pictures, butyou shouldn t do them in these.
eng_Latn I didn't even think about it.
eng_Latn I called out several times, as loud as I could raise my voice.
eng_Latn I had too many more important things to obsess over.
eng_Latn for he was thinking of the miserable twenty five dollars left him from all his recent ghastly adventures.
eng_Latn so that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.
eng_Latn I am sure that it was really the sob of a woman.
eng_Latn (puffing and panting) I'm here! Okay. Let's catch those bad guys, rescue your uncle, and get back to the picnic.
eng_Latn so he hastened their departure, which they took at once
eng_Latn placed the summum bonum was in the gifts of nature
eng_Latn they went away.
eng_Latn keeping the gun in the shadowed hollow of one lacerated and shredded elbow.
eng_Latn I'm so happy.
eng_Latn I should think he might be, with the trial to morrow.
eng_Latn I checked them all out.
eng_Latn I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized.
eng_Latn whether they expected to.
eng_Latn I took his leg and his eye.
eng_Latn I'm very glad, anyway, that I persuaded him,' she said
eng_Latn his honor being engaged in keeping it
eng_Latn And now I must solve my own mystery. Where is my favourite blue pencil?
eng_Latn I confess I had my suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty.
eng_Latn begged to ask him a few questions.
eng_Latn Little sausages wrapped in bacon.
eng_Latn take this door!
eng_Latn I have cried till I have no eyes left.
eng_Latn So they d... be waiting for us at the end of our adventure?
eng_Latn I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take a holt of a snake skin again with my hands, now that I see what had come of it.
eng_Latn I don't know nothing much about it.
eng_Latn she persisted in riding on the sled.
eng_Latn I won't say anything
eng_Latn Pleased to meet you. I'm Dave.
eng_Latn but nothing happened.
eng_Latn made him the more diligent
eng_Latn who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
eng_Latn when she came striding into view across the lawn
eng_Latn I've never been so shocked in my entire life.
eng_Latn I've got to get out of this place
eng_Latn I pointed at the picture.
eng_Latn for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here.
eng_Latn a spoonful once in four and twenty hours.
eng_Latn Snark. Snark. Snark. SNARKKK!
eng_Latn I reminded him.
eng_Latn she thought and desperation came back to her.
eng_Latn I am glad indeed to find other persons present.
eng_Latn his fingers dug into the ground
eng_Latn but he was careful to hide it under his shirt.
eng_Latn the soutane in folds no more graceful than the easy length of the body inhabiting it.
eng_Latn I went and knelt beside him.
eng_Latn I have a further thought.
eng_Latn she so delights in your conversation
eng_Latn I'm sure now that I shouldn't be afraid of him
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! Then you should do it in very small voice, like this.. (Girly voice) Hello, I am a lovely girl and not a man, even though I have a hairy chin. Oo look, a kitten.
eng_Latn asked me the object of my visit.
eng_Latn as he happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene
eng_Latn a long night during which she lay awake until dawn, her ears strained to hear his key in the latch.
eng_Latn as one was grateful for the sunshine and the rain.
eng_Latn raised a shout
eng_Latn I have come to tell you that this must end.
eng_Latn I'll get my proof for you all right.
eng_Latn but I won't have you do this sort of thing.
eng_Latn for the street was blocked.
eng_Latn when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a MAN along.
eng_Latn a great readiness to be pleased with other people.
eng_Latn leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.
eng_Latn but I know what would happen.
eng_Latn or lest others should think she must.
eng_Latn he has ordered me to take him
eng_Latn I opened the book at random, as she proposed
eng_Latn in such cases the complete revelation always produces the impression of a previous duplicity.
eng_Latn said a tall, grizzly haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features
eng_Latn I say, this is folly!
eng_Latn I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients.
eng_Latn I don't expect you to stop it, but I do expect you to remember it!
eng_Latn for your own safety, you will have to spend the night here.
eng_Latn never lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question.
eng_Latn I turned to run
eng_Latn putting the boy in his charge
eng_Latn the father shouted.
eng_Latn by presenting dreadful scenes to their view.
eng_Latn would it be fair in one of her station and considering
eng_Latn pulled it off.
eng_Latn If people came here, they would look at us and look at us like we were in a zoo.
eng_Latn I just wasn't capable of letting her go.
eng_Latn raising his camera.
eng_Latn but he never received the response he longed for
eng_Latn still no answer.
eng_Latn It is Pug...a star ship. And we reabout to see a star close up.
eng_Latn he pretended not to understand, and turned the conversation.
eng_Latn And dancing? I love to dance.
eng_Latn I don' wanna go back there no more'I'm tar'd.
eng_Latn Little Red Riding Hood!
eng_Latn I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor heard
eng_Latn or some mark by which it might be known as infamous and a corrupter of good manners.
eng_Latn We re home.
eng_Latn must 'a been jealous, to tear such clothes!
eng_Latn meeting with any interruption by the way.
eng_Latn left his master dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens
eng_Latn this step he had taken since the preceding evening.
eng_Latn I am reading forbidden books.
eng_Latn bending, kissed her cheek.
eng_Latn far beyond us in the wood.
eng_Latn I only want to be consulted sometimes.
eng_Latn there is nothing which I shall hold back.
eng_Latn Wow Bowzer! You should have crossed the bridge one at a time. It's too old and rickety to take two of you at once.
eng_Latn had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously.
eng_Latn or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away.
eng_Latn kissed each of the two large tears.
eng_Latn here for the first time there had come a chance which had set him at a disadvantage.
eng_Latn then raising her voice
eng_Latn then they raise hell an' figger he been killed.
eng_Latn then broke for five minutes, then gave it again.
eng_Latn looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there
eng_Latn but as far as I know the facts, I can't.
eng_Latn I hope you know by those marks what young gentleman I mean.
eng_Latn we passed her house
eng_Latn How kind.
eng_Latn holding it erect in the air
eng_Latn with a menacing note in her voice, taking the handkerchief from her eyes.
eng_Latn where he found some ten officers and generals.
eng_Latn for the picture had been removed.
eng_Latn I have unfortunately been cheated in marriage
eng_Latn Hello. My name is Dog and this isPug.
eng_Latn as though she could not get breath to scream.
eng_Latn I don't like to see you quarrelling.
eng_Latn they flew into the passage crying for help.
eng_Latn prevented them from mutilating the tree all the way to the trunk.
eng_Latn so I come down the back way.
eng_Latn especially on the innate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the strength of the gander.
eng_Latn held her tightly.
eng_Latn only his face is visible now.
eng_Latn pulled it off.
eng_Latn she had to stoop low to get through the doorway.
eng_Latn glanced at his watch.
eng_Latn I love the smell of them.
eng_Latn you'll cry and let them go.
eng_Latn I don't care how merry you are at my expense this morning
eng_Latn ulysses came to the palace dressed liked a beggar
eng_Latn pause to sniff at something on the floor.
eng_Latn glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list,
eng_Latn well, he'd hand 'em something that would surprise 'em.
eng_Latn however, to sleep ashore till the last.
eng_Latn all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kindman.
eng_Latn a line which did not scan and made no sense with what went before
eng_Latn an eagerness which she was too confused to see.
eng_Latn want to tell ME't any cretur 't's in his right mind 's a goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I?
eng_Latn I was drunk with it, with the scent of her.
eng_Latn I must entice him to marry my daughter
eng_Latn he had been ready to set out in search of her
eng_Latn I shall need you.
eng_Latn he flung it out of the window
eng_Latn but I took no notice.
eng_Latn I am not altogether out of hopes, in some time, to suffer a neighbour _Yahoo_ in my company
eng_Latn Pug would like a lot of answersplease.
eng_Latn I thought about that for a moment.
eng_Latn now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason.
eng_Latn she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift.
eng_Latn a cloud of dust boiled up.
eng_Latn So we decided to take it to her.
eng_Latn a squandering altogether out of proportion to our means.
eng_Latn he wanted to kill me
eng_Latn Fantastical Feats ... SumptuousFeasts..Aah . Mini-Beasts!
eng_Latn when the sound of a voice, still at some distance
eng_Latn as though she couldn't have sent it off herself!
eng_Latn I haven't made a mistake.
eng_Latn he said to the waitress.
eng_Latn for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.
eng_Latn keeping her head down and working in silence.
eng_Latn I got such a shak ing it near brought my liver up.
eng_Latn Lots more cardboard Dog. I ll needto make it MUCH bigger if I'm going to fit a round table inside!
eng_Latn he was both seen and heard
eng_Latn May I see your painting Pug?
eng_Latn I'm going to have a baby.
eng_Latn gave him the thumbs up.
eng_Latn WOOAH Ooh How curious... again.
eng_Latn he kept saying to himself that unless she would permit him to her room
eng_Latn but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.
eng_Latn besides, the bell rang.
eng_Latn was tenderer than usual and even more delightful.
eng_Latn though rank and wealth sever us widely
eng_Latn I got the paper and read it yesterday.
eng_Latn I tried all day two days.
eng_Latn I want you to brew them carefully
eng_Latn (bouncing and throwing)
eng_Latn (heaving noises) Yeah. Like that s going to happen.
eng_Latn but I followed the scent through the house.
eng_Latn What was that?
eng_Latn but she had not forgotten him.
eng_Latn as though he were keeping something to himself.
eng_Latn all about it.
eng_Latn pestered him with her attentions
eng_Latn took the platter of sausages with trembling hands.
eng_Latn They re not mouldy! They re GREEN! I got green fingers growing fings!
eng_Latn I think you'll do best to keep your visions to yourself
eng_Latn glanced towards me.
eng_Latn Yip! What are those Dog!?
eng_Latn I want to know why I'm lying for you.
eng_Latn And if we don t find some soon we ll be gone too.
eng_Latn when I brought out the baked apples from the closet
eng_Latn I just need to ' take this call.
eng_Latn probably he had just had a beating.
eng_Latn if the reader puts all his intelligence at our service
eng_Latn whoever wants to flourish and become rich
eng_Latn I wish I could be like you.
eng_Latn but I never knew its significance before.
eng_Latn in the ardour of this discovery
eng_Latn he abandoned all self respect.
eng_Latn an umbrella it might have been.
eng_Latn during which his face became pale
eng_Latn its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away.
eng_Latn having gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked back to see if he might hope for pardon.
eng_Latn The bookshop mice!
eng_Latn to speak the first ship I sight
eng_Latn most of it grief and pain and hunger.
eng_Latn Just follow the wool!
eng_Latn went together into the granary
eng_Latn How to lo-ok af-ter your dog!
eng_Latn he had waited fourteen years for his liberty
eng_Latn why the watchmen had taken no alarm.
eng_Latn All the things we did before Dog, about books AND bees AND spiders, but at the same time, so it's become something new!
eng_Latn out of which there jumped a fat gentleman
eng_Latn he always made new friends, and he didn't need to spend all of his time with them.
eng_Latn waiting for the room to clear.
eng_Latn with very heavy eyebrows
eng_Latn I recognized the sweetness in the air
eng_Latn his heart beat so violently
eng_Latn somehow it all came together as a nearly perfect friendship
eng_Latn each of you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.
eng_Latn I rolled my head around to look at her.
eng_Latn even in a landscape,
eng_Latn think of some way by which they could meet before, if possible.
eng_Latn I was very happy, however, nearly all the time.
eng_Latn as there isn't SOME of us wasn't brought up respectable.
eng_Latn but to tell you the truth, what happened back at the office scared the wits out of me.
eng_Latn by my free will
eng_Latn turned the pages without reading it.
eng_Latn Welcome to the What and When andWherehouse.
eng_Latn where tea was prepared
eng_Latn but to tell you the truth, what happened back at the office scared the wits out of me.
eng_Latn but keep your eyes off me,
eng_Latn she died three days later, poisoned by her own blood, with a pair of twins crossed in her stomach.
eng_Latn so many great princes and captains were assembled.
eng_Latn I won't say anything
eng_Latn I'm afraid I am late for an engagement.
eng_Latn even might lead her at last to refuse all offers.
eng_Latn driving or walking, and we'll have capital times.
eng_Latn the night about three hours spent
eng_Latn since you let yourself be bound to this treasure whose loss would make no poor man poorer.
eng_Latn she turned just in time
eng_Latn now raising myself up again
eng_Latn Yes you can Pug.
eng_Latn I shall have no time to read it over and correct it
eng_Latn plait him watch chains, or interrupt him at his work, hailing him
eng_Latn look at my brothers.
eng_Latn From all the lava I would say we are nearing the centre of the...
eng_Latn but now it is ended and over for good.
eng_Latn who again and again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth and the holding of wealth
eng_Latn for a last look at the house.
eng_Latn if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.
eng_Latn shotgun in his hands.
eng_Latn I can't move in with you.
eng_Latn she felt sorry for him, and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to totter.
eng_Latn he was at liberty to wander about the house.
eng_Latn I think he's pretty unhappy, and I know I am!
eng_Latn Ready. Steady. Go!
eng_Latn hooked the handle of the bucket on to the end of it.
eng_Latn on her wrists she wore some glass beads
eng_Latn cat like, with bare feet
eng_Latn I would suggest that you try to find employment more suitable to your circumstances.
eng_Latn but waked early
eng_Latn That was probably a bit too pushy.
eng_Latn without any scene from which she did not return with the same unperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color.
eng_Latn whether they expected to.
eng_Latn grandly into camp
eng_Latn went for a turn in his garden.
eng_Latn made such impressive motions to me not to ask any more questions
eng_Latn I didn't know how to reach you.
eng_Latn I did not even know he had come.
eng_Latn rising slowly he moved to the table.
eng_Latn but I never knew its significance before.
eng_Latn this sham victim that was crucified for six hours, forsooth, and rose again from the dead!
eng_Latn then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour
eng_Latn this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk
eng_Latn After me boys. One..two...three...
eng_Latn the nickname, he said, was an inheritance from his respected father.
eng_Latn the kind of vision I'd had of the bad time that's coming
eng_Latn But first a poem.(He poses) Oh...
eng_Latn the three following not a drop will be got.
eng_Latn with every appearance of being seriously ill.
eng_Latn I had at least twenty girls.
eng_Latn thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner
eng_Latn it was useless to attempt to move further by night.
eng_Latn in an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from under him.
eng_Latn More precious than diamonds. More prized than gold.
eng_Latn she heaved a deep sigh of relief
eng_Latn had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward.
eng_Latn I had brought, and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour
eng_Latn Hiding.. Hiking.. Hunting!
eng_Latn ...I have a BRIGHT RED FEATHER behind my ear!
eng_Latn that you've been in a wrong position altogether
eng_Latn was folded one over another.
eng_Latn she simply had a red knitted cap
eng_Latn darkness only came in through the window.
eng_Latn besides, the bell rang.
eng_Latn I see I wor wrang but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat might...
eng_Latn I don't understand.
eng_Latn come to security.
eng_Latn I almost scream.
eng_Latn relieving him of the visor, already battered to pieces by blows
eng_Latn then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control.
eng_Latn watch me spit in your eye!
eng_Latn waited an hour and a half.
eng_Latn I asked her for it long ago.
eng_Latn It had scales. And fins. I think it is a fish!
eng_Latn I had not eaten.
eng_Latn I was badly bred.
eng_Latn we have neglected many things.
eng_Latn hurried her into his room
eng_Latn I must go out alone.
eng_Latn it would require two horses.
eng_Latn I brought him down one evening, the day before yesterday
eng_Latn spare no arguments to induce him to come.
eng_Latn I want you to get out of this town.
eng_Latn that if he the landlord really had no other place for me
eng_Latn as an equal
eng_Latn I held the blackness of nonexistence at bay by inches.
eng_Latn during the discussion of such serious affairs
eng_Latn I did not come this way,' I said.
eng_Latn he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste.
eng_Latn there was suddenly pain there again I remembered.
eng_Latn so that we are like those misers who are unable to absent themselves from their treasures.
eng_Latn sob for the old days.
eng_Latn shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.
eng_Latn We did our best. Now its time to test it.
eng_Latn after all she was only a little old woman in a black dress.
eng_Latn then spreading them on the table
eng_Latn Ouch! Aaah! (giggle)
eng_Latn I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room.
eng_Latn weighing the pieces on a pharmacist's scale, and calculating its breadth with a gunsmith's calipers.
eng_Latn Ooh I like ketchup on my hot dogs!
eng_Latn my mother and sister.
eng_Latn I'd never met any vampires less civilized.
eng_Latn then when she came down that night she was going to have told you all about it.
eng_Latn everything else will come right of itself.
eng_Latn I replied that the money had been all my own.
eng_Latn it is not exciting on my island
eng_Latn they saw at once that the usual decorations were missing.
eng_Latn I say, this is folly!
eng_Latn I knocked him sprawling.
eng_Latn gave him what must have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss.
eng_Latn his robes ripped
eng_Latn opened a drawer
eng_Latn when suddenly the idea occurred to him
eng_Latn but she did not show it.
eng_Latn I might get cold.
eng_Latn waiting for his housekeeper to serve lunch.
eng_Latn a grin breaking across his face
eng_Latn It's a power-cut Pug. Theysometimes happen in cities.
eng_Latn I decided to operate under the assumption that he had tried going home as well
eng_Latn but my correspondent has disappeared
eng_Latn I bury forever any hope of ever standing alone.
eng_Latn you questioned me
eng_Latn so crooked it looked
eng_Latn money to eat
eng_Latn I also beg to return you your five hundred gulden.
eng_Latn looking around him once more.
eng_Latn so I invented a few.
eng_Latn I normally get about ten emails every morning, if that.
eng_Latn as we ourselves might have done

eng_Latn I have such trouble about it.
eng_Latn that could have encouraged him to reveal to me
eng_Latn she had succeeded, she was satisfied.
eng_Latn No more blue period for me. Look at this. Ta-dah!
eng_Latn she won't be downwind if we sit in our regular spot.
eng_Latn they lifted the bench and the old man toppled over amid roars of laughter.
eng_Latn as to where she had gone or was now.
eng_Latn he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant
eng_Latn they would be renewed
eng_Latn nothing was left.
eng_Latn I won't need you to rescue me.
eng_Latn a cloud of dust boiled up.
eng_Latn cause nobody will never know half of what he was.
eng_Latn when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death.
eng_Latn grabbing the elf's arm to stop him.
eng_Latn I've been relieved.
eng_Latn on my approach it was let drop.
eng_Latn bent over the body.
eng_Latn afterwards general on sea
eng_Latn but great masses of crumbling stone had fallen inward and lay in the courtyard, heaped against the wall.
eng_Latn began another laugh.
eng_Latn crossed his legs
eng_Latn I wouldn't've been able to stand it.
eng_Latn if I do not knock them head over heels
eng_Latn since I have been told
eng_Latn that extended far and wide
eng_Latn he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse.
eng_Latn almost crumpling beneath the weight of a disapproval she had never known before.
eng_Latn I don't care about lessening the sentence!
eng_Latn as though he were keeping something to himself.
eng_Latn the inspector arrived with the intern
eng_Latn You don t want to be like me Pug. Being well hidden isn t a gift but a curse. Sometimes, when I'm around other animals I....
eng_Latn but the dark had no answer for her
eng_Latn I'll see what I can do.
eng_Latn I was so totally mortified
eng_Latn she had come upon something there which had made a great impression on her.
eng_Latn Ooh I love seeing a big pile of books I have never seen before!
eng_Latn I swallow hard.
eng_Latn in obedience to the doctor's impulse, home they went.
eng_Latn or lest others should think she must.
eng_Latn I am ready to give up my whole life.
eng_Latn but only gazed, leaning back in her chair.
eng_Latn I don t understand. Billy Barker sbiscuits only taste of things that dogs like. How could fish get into my recipes?
eng_Latn Ooh And now I am dog tired!
eng_Latn it was proposed by the brother and sister that they should join in a walk, some morning or other.
eng_Latn Don t you have sat-nav?

eng_Latn I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move
eng_Latn I pressed myself to him even tighterof never having to let you go. and he leaned down to kiss me
eng_Latn set forth again
eng_Latn I will only add now
eng_Latn for she did not know her in this new mood.
eng_Latn I mean, I haven't really made much effort
eng_Latn And they stay in a hotel?
eng_Latn not having to cook.
eng_Latn that if he faltered
eng_Latn I was not quite sure when you first came that you were the same man.
eng_Latn this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies.
eng_Latn but I didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune.
eng_Latn tell them what I had seen.
eng_Latn bound to its place with the rope.
eng_Latn a self confidence that was alien to this place.
eng_Latn I've never heard such terrible lies in my whole life.
eng_Latn fine de scissors without takin' all night 'bout it.
eng_Latn I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded.
eng_Latn I have no control over myself.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book about the coldest place in the world? They ll know how to keep warm there!
eng_Latn I hope it will cure him.
eng_Latn the instant they have returned from a long journey.
eng_Latn he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly.
eng_Latn New tricks?
eng_Latn I don't think they's luck or bad luck.
eng_Latn Would you like Pug to teach you to dance?
eng_Latn was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.
eng_Latn he pulled up his coat collar
eng_Latn That woe is real Pug. Come on!
eng_Latn I insist on seeing the will.
eng_Latn I wish you a good day.
eng_Latn she memorized what he had said
eng_Latn then he began to watch her, fascinated.
eng_Latn besides, you will accompany me
eng_Latn I forgot to tell you the farm news, but it's very distressing.
eng_Latn one's eye moved on quickly to her daughter
eng_Latn now going up to the fire stood with his back towards it
eng_Latn she won't be downwind if we sit in our regular spot.
eng_Latn I'm sure they would enjoy my fish flavoured chocolate digestives.
eng_Latn that seemed intended to awaken her too.
eng_Latn I made us all late
eng_Latn Then what is it?
eng_Latn only eighteen were left after the charge.
eng_Latn well, I mustn't let my carnal lusts obtrude.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder, Pug!
eng_Latn but I won't go.
eng_Latn I say, stop there.
eng_Latn An excellent idea Pug. Come on.
eng_Latn the house was ramshackle after all
eng_Latn what commercial and social honors might not come to him?
eng_Latn whoever wants to flourish and become rich
eng_Latn I am very glad, said the prince.
eng_Latn to the end of her life remembered
eng_Latn You can t rush genius, Dog.
eng_Latn a man who does not even know how to carry his breeding.
eng_Latn but all was still as death.
eng_Latn except that I was conscious of being cold and dejected
eng_Latn as long a dream as that
eng_Latn Pug, do you still have the napkinfrom your doggy biscuit soup?
eng_Latn I can't bear to hear about it.
eng_Latn plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way
eng_Latn I doubted whether there were any fish to catch.
eng_Latn Please follow us on our tour.
eng_Latn Dogstar was hurt, then angry, then very, very sad.
eng_Latn he took up the piece of bread and carefully crumbled it away.
eng_Latn it seemed to himthat what he had just said was really true.
eng_Latn would not be to write truth, but falsehood
eng_Latn it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.
eng_Latn he decided to deny themotion.
eng_Latn I intend to try.
eng_Latn on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill.
eng_Latn I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress.
eng_Latn there is no room for fear on this lighter.
eng_Latn he won't pay for me to go and learn magic.
eng_Latn Once there was a magic pencil wholived in a world that was one big blank piece of paper.
eng_Latn then did both together.
eng_Latn but you would sell yourself to a man you didn't love
eng_Latn went to draw the curtains at his window.
eng_Latn he said coldly
eng_Latn but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it.
eng_Latn you can now have confidence in me after what I have done
eng_Latn if readers would only take this advice.
eng_Latn turned and went due east again.
eng_Latn I'll kill him.
eng_Latn I didn't recognize my voice when I answered.
eng_Latn it rested there.
eng_Latn suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand
eng_Latn I wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars, I wouldn't.
eng_Latn One difference to find boys.

eng_Latn but I am a poor student, and I have my way to make.
eng_Latn but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.
eng_Latn would not be built before another ten years.
eng_Latn I forgot to take any blotting paper and my fountain pen leaked.
eng_Latn so you just must come and take me away.
eng_Latn ....lots of stairs?
eng_Latn today, to believe that the past is unalterable.
eng_Latn I can't tell why we should stay.
eng_Latn but if the advice was that the palace security troops needed extensive further training and a crash course, at that
eng_Latn their greatest dread now was lest the stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before its right time
eng_Latn they stopped and I stopped.
eng_Latn buried them in a secret place
eng_Latn I loved only her.
eng_Latn so I entered to see.
eng_Latn but we returned them, fearing a machine gun in the station buildings.
eng_Latn as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.
eng_Latn to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet
eng_Latn So a Snark is a very small bird.
eng_Latn only, I should think, a better portrait.
eng_Latn it's very unbecoming.
eng_Latn that was falling apart because he had looked at it so often.
eng_Latn mounting his ass himself
eng_Latn now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible
eng_Latn especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality.
eng_Latn sighing once or twice
eng_Latn I had raised my hat
eng_Latn I've a mind to take the watch back.
eng_Latn I am only two and twenty
eng_Latn he never encouraged me, you know.

eng_Latn it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your illness, perhaps.
eng_Latn there are odds and ends upon the ground.
eng_Latn I'll last a few more minutes with luck, but not much longer.
eng_Latn ran for it with all their might.
eng_Latn I don't mind going back to the store.
eng_Latn he fell into such a deep sleep
eng_Latn a fact which she had impressed upon him.
eng_Latn so you'd better get packed.
eng_Latn One of light and one of night.
eng_Latn but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in his sleep.
eng_Latn he is very unfortunate
eng_Latn I had not deceived him, though, not for a moment.
eng_Latn he was corrupted by his environment,' and so on.
eng_Latn to have another think.
eng_Latn make certain that their glasses were full.
eng_Latn unless he were actuated by a decided feeling of avarice, but that is impossible
eng_Latn she still didn't put pen to paper.
eng_Latn looking so earnestly at her father
eng_Latn Maybe I didn t tap the wand hardenough?
eng_Latn now I know that he's not alone, and that even I am not alone.

eng_Latn he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture.
eng_Latn Hmmm, the can-can. That s a good name for a dance.
eng_Latn if you oppose me in this great stake
eng_Latn I'm going to get him back.
eng_Latn But what about the poor pigs -they ll have no home!
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug!
eng_Latn sang to it softly, to lull it to sleep.
eng_Latn that he knew anything against him
eng_Latn that I didn't come home to dinner.

eng_Latn I will put you to the proof, and this very moment.
eng_Latn it has the might to do so and therefore the right.

eng_Latn we can get a station wagon, put him in the back, and go on
eng_Latn sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation.
eng_Latn begged to ask him a few questions.
eng_Latn till she found her arm drawn within his, and pressed against his heart
eng_Latn cracked it over his own head
eng_Latn pretty near the cook
eng_Latn paused to look for the house which was the object of their search.
eng_Latn I see him from time to time.
eng_Latn for, remember, he has no gills.
eng_Latn Dog, I thought I saw a something.

eng_Latn hearing something snap in his verist.
eng_Latn he is a hero!
eng_Latn I shall see you here quite often enough.
eng_Latn I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one.
eng_Latn falling clear upon the dark silence.
eng_Latn A very good question... which Ihope to answer in the next edition of my book.
eng_Latn How curious. I had a funny feelingtoo.
eng_Latn In and out. In and out.
eng_Latn I'd be happier if a teacher were present.
eng_Latn that is joy
eng_Latn I took her face in my hand.
eng_Latn I know the answer to many riddles.
eng_Latn out of danger of possible stragglers.

eng_Latn I'd never been strong enough to deal with the things outside my control, to attack the enemies or outrun them.
eng_Latn I hurriedly shuffled back to the one of the leaf floating on the puddle.
eng_Latn that was all he could remember.
eng_Latn thewhole of this cataclysm is wonderfully conducted.
eng_Latn I glad to see you boys
eng_Latn I don't really remember.
eng_Latn It was, in a pretending kind of way.
eng_Latn for I was going home to the funeral.
eng_Latn indeed, it was soon plain to me that
eng_Latn I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him
eng_Latn I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting.
eng_Latn hoping that they would meet hers
eng_Latn she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor

eng_Latn so she spoke.
eng_Latn I can't look up.
eng_Latn After repelling the second enemy
eng_Latn her dreams were a wild kaleidoscope of fires and automobile accidents and shootings.
eng_Latn by no means in the latter's favour.

eng_Latn but every word in the article was emblazoned on his mind.
eng_Latn next year 'll do.
eng_Latn I didn't mean to say anything.
eng_Latn It's like we re really there!
eng_Latn take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing.
eng_Latn as it's my fault he no longer has a rat.
eng_Latn while 22 per cent felt it could be less crunchy
eng_Latn I had heard of it before.
eng_Latn I have not the right.
eng_Latn from which I had been so strangely delivered.
eng_Latn We have plenty.
eng_Latn it's no use now.
eng_Latn thence upon the leads and gutters
eng_Latn With balloons, streamers anddoggie biscuits
eng_Latn I had to avert my eyes
eng_Latn so I am sure that you will not refuse me.
eng_Latn though not, as you will see, of his affairs.

eng_Latn he resolutely entered the church.
eng_Latn despair of nothing we would attain,
eng_Latn We are about to see the rarest of all night creatures.
eng_Latn having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities.
eng_Latn I kept my temper though.
eng_Latn setting sail for some other harbor.
eng_Latn I thought it was rather a short name, yesterday,' I confessed.
eng_Latn I could not speak to her either, and I did not even see her.
eng_Latn this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of the children of the brain.
eng_Latn I'll think the thing over
eng_Latn hurrying along the corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go
eng_Latn I watched them walk down the hill and disappear behind a wall.
eng_Latn but that he was still in great danger.
eng_Latn I wish he got a pot of hominy in his pocket.

eng_Latn when I heard
eng_Latn held her and rocked her as if she were a baby.
eng_Latn she had gauged her quarry well, the gross old spider.
eng_Latn And who are they?
eng_Latn but his face was beardless

eng_Latn while the evening slowly deepened into night.
eng_Latn a dome like building, the size of a big theater.
eng_Latn I'm not going to sign away your life to him.
eng_Latn he has spent the night in drinking himself to death deliberately!
eng_Latn you can now have confidence in me after what I have done
eng_Latn I smiled wanly at the nervous man.
eng_Latn they fitted me exactly.
eng_Latn I think I know what it is.
eng_Latn as an explanation of the first.
eng_Latn it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away.
eng_Latn till this moment I've been afraid to ask you, even you.
eng_Latn no one ever dared go inside
eng_Latn I was always with the house elf.
eng_Latn but it had been a narrow escape
eng_Latn And I think it taught a valuable lesson Pug.
eng_Latn but as he tried to stand
eng_Latn but it's good natured.
eng_Latn but it was a menacing accident.
eng_Latn laying a soiled and unopened letter before him
eng_Latn like I'd done it a thousand times before

eng_Latn but controlled himself and closed the door softly behind him.

eng_Latn we passed her house
eng_Latn I glad to see you boys
eng_Latn because he didn't ask me for any more details.
eng_Latn a good little child,whose soul is now in heaven.
eng_Latn but still to speak to a man even though mute was something
eng_Latn brought my heart into my mouth
eng_Latn I said it is a nice fake.
eng_Latn she replied, pointing at the luggage rack over the man's head
eng_Latn And will it help with your own excavations Pug?
eng_Latn though only made of the pack saddles and cloths of his mules
eng_Latn as some of the others were beginning to depart
eng_Latn his friend was in pursuit of his destiny.
eng_Latn my mouth dry.
eng_Latn he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture.
eng_Latn I dare not insist,
eng_Latn I took her out of a bad house
eng_Latn I thought the place for an able bodied man was in the fighting line.
eng_Latn as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.
eng_Latn but I ran to the body of a tree
eng_Latn had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate.
eng_Latn got out, looked around
eng_Latn I had breathed it before, touched it surely, that very afternoon.
eng_Latn for ever maybe.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! Then you should do it all sweetly, but manly too. Like this. (Manly voice) Grrr, I am a hero and do hero things, but also I am sweet. Oo look, a kitten.

eng_Latn through the main sail.
eng_Latn sometimes to put a suffering beast out of its misery, sometimes to fell a boar or a dingo.
eng_Latn he sprinkled the crumbs from his sandwich paper over them
eng_Latn we ought to support our cossacks
eng_Latn so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed.
eng_Latn it was as though her eternal happiness depended on the color of her hangings or the shape of an old chest.
eng_Latn Anyone can learn to perform mystifying illusions.
eng_Latn but suddenly composing himself, he fell on his knees
eng_Latn We could knit her a wooly hat. Do you have any knitting needles?
eng_Latn but in a minute I see I was mistaken
eng_Latn I always wanted you to jine
eng_Latn I never shall see my pretty darling again.
eng_Latn choking itself in the collar.
eng_Latn You re very near!
eng_Latn candour is not to be confounded with scorn.
eng_Latn I did the wolf whined
eng_Latn should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness.
eng_Latn she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift.
eng_Latn without a certain amount of personal risk and without a great profusion in spending his money.
eng_Latn I saw you with the red headed man I ran away from.

eng_Latn but she married three times
eng_Latn which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us
eng_Latn I'm going to wither away to absolutely nothing.
eng_Latn she began to recall what.
eng_Latn so belaboured him that they brought him sorely battered to the ground.
eng_Latn she watched from between her knees.
eng_Latn I must talk to you.
eng_Latn he observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.
eng_Latn he shut her door behind him and locked it.
eng_Latn social intercourse had paused before it started.
eng_Latn before going down she went into the room where the icons hung
eng_Latn where she left me alone.
eng_Latn that of a whale ship at sea.
eng_Latn I had some for breakfast! So youare a great detective too.
eng_Latn sooner or later we must come upon the right.
eng_Latn miraculously the snake slumped to the floor
eng_Latn but no two theories were alike
eng_Latn take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing.
eng_Latn I had at least twenty girls.
eng_Latn that we can and will perish in this hell hole eventually.
eng_Latn I have no control over myself.
eng_Latn not to admit anyone who was not on that list?
eng_Latn is the more deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril.
eng_Latn I shall never see her again!
eng_Latn he must wake up!
eng_Latn Could I borrow your mouse-tach for a moment please Dog? I have a few ideas for how you might like to do your acting.
eng_Latn he is extremely well trained.
eng_Latn but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.
eng_Latn had survived only because she was as mean as her husband.
eng_Latn I will tell you how you can care for me better than any surgeon.
eng_Latn jeweled with flowers.
eng_Latn he had suddenly felt uneasy.
eng_Latn Perhaps you could guide the next meditation Pug?
eng_Latn a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.
eng_Latn are not always of noble birth, or liberal education.
eng_Latn where he looked me up
eng_Latn the end of which is still in suspense
eng_Latn I for my part should be willing to give you full opportunity and hearing.
eng_Latn she won't be downwind if we sit in our regular spot.
eng_Latn the bark had been rubbed away to show the branch's white bone.
eng_Latn had very little to do with reality.
eng_Latn in order to see the operation well performed
eng_Latn most of it grief and pain and hunger.
eng_Latn he barked, by way of a morning greeting.
eng_Latn the light died from his eyes.
eng_Latn which showed he understood his business.
eng_Latn covered with aquatic plants
eng_Latn his lopsided mouth revealed a number of missing teeth.
eng_Latn that she did not dare to decipher.
eng_Latn probably without seeing us.
eng_Latn pestered him with her attentions
eng_Latn the yellow harvest moon
eng_Latn he stopped short.
eng_Latn I might get cold.
eng_Latn stolen a horse and such a horse!
eng_Latn refreshed and renewed, at the unusual hour of eleven o' clock
eng_Latn was a very great lady.
eng_Latn from whom he told him to take the carts.
eng_Latn to common sense and reason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and criminal causes.
eng_Latn foisting it off on her friends and relatives.
eng_Latn I bolted the door.
eng_Latn Pug ... I'm coming!
eng_Latn but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go.
eng_Latn I love you.
eng_Latn when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room window
eng_Latn his glance wandered away with the stream
eng_Latn being always provided with a good number of books.
eng_Latn I gazed steadily at my plate.
eng_Latn but instead she avoided passing through the villages of her nostalgia.
eng_Latn I loved only her.
eng_Latn receiving everything from society and giving nothing in return.
eng_Latn I forgot to tell you
eng_Latn he needed to sleep, he had to
eng_Latn I am incapable of doing so, he said.
eng_Latn I can t hold on much – Yah
eng_Latn now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.
eng_Latn he swallowed half of it.
eng_Latn I need not go, I am sure, I answered.
eng_Latn I looked at her again
eng_Latn all joined hands
eng_Latn I only wish to say two or three words to your master
eng_Latn he moved and stood in her way.
eng_Latn he was still in want of quiet.
eng_Latn I remember that, but it was hardly noticed.
eng_Latn I never saw you for an instant.
eng_Latn except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.
eng_Latn because I loved you best.
eng_Latn as yet, indeed, he was not sufficient of a diplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its possibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor.
eng_Latn although he must be miserable without them.
eng_Latn No please don t go yet.Camille will be here any minute.
eng_Latn he never encouraged me, you know.
eng_Latn don't oblige me to compel you.
eng_Latn I can't I can't live without her!
eng_Latn I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart.
eng_Latn I'll bring it you directly.
eng_Latn that extended far and wide
eng_Latn but not discovering his mistake until he had got half way down it
eng_Latn cash, and cash down, I mean?
eng_Latn the young wife of an elderly man of fortune here.
eng_Latn I knew that you were peculiar
eng_Latn then, without waiting for an answer
eng_Latn I normally get about ten emails every morning, if that.
eng_Latn Not yet Pug. This isn t the righttime in the story.
eng_Latn here he raised his hand as if unconsciously
eng_Latn as she cocked her head and listened.
eng_Latn was so daring and such a villain
eng_Latn the soul won't obey the rules of mechanics
eng_Latn I kept my voice light.
eng_Latn though none had inherited quite such an aggressively red head as his.
eng_Latn I am glad to recollect that when the carrier began to move
eng_Latn I don't mean to obey it
eng_Latn we are good friends with him
eng_Latn at that moment made his way through the crowd
eng_Latn I won't say anything
eng_Latn No, it is brilliant! And you arebrilliant. One day everyone will see what a genius you are.
eng_Latn he laid his finger on his lip
eng_Latn Ook-Ook! Eek-Eek!
eng_Latn the whole contrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was
eng_Latn there were three times as many people employed as were necessary
eng_Latn so she spoke.
eng_Latn I hadn't an idea until about a couple of hours ago that they were going to have this meeting.
eng_Latn they had almost ruined their health.
eng_Latn all was in the same posture
eng_Latn he had a very indefinite notion of what it consisted in
eng_Latn such is the law of nature.
eng_Latn but we returned them, fearing a machine gun in the station buildings.
eng_Latn a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.
eng_Latn but it had been a narrow escape
eng_Latn but once he learned it he never forgot it
eng_Latn then syncope sets in, and more especially with people of strong constitution like this man.
eng_Latn her father's fury broke over her in a terrible storm.
eng_Latn he resolutely began the ascent.
eng_Latn there was already three feet of water
eng_Latn where did you get it
eng_Latn you can go and get on with it
eng_Latn I am needed.
eng_Latn For our tea.
eng_Latn Robotics... Bats in Attics ....Aah..ACROBATICS!
eng_Latn wherever you go
eng_Latn I recognized him at glance.
eng_Latn then got up and hurried away.
eng_Latn so that it was of service only when propped against the wall.
eng_Latn but, perceiving his error
eng_Latn I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.
eng_Latn stopped his sorrel at the steps of the town hall, and waving his whip in the air, shouted to the peasant.
eng_Latn Now let s get that lunchbox to Granny Pug.
eng_Latn I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with which the king
eng_Latn but for the moment he was in a very good temper.
eng_Latn In and out. In and out.
eng_Latn Where s Camille?
eng_Latn above the average in height
eng_Latn there miserably howled
eng_Latn but then she is used to my voice.
eng_Latn I won't give away anything and to her less than any one!
eng_Latn his friend was in pursuit of his destiny.
eng_Latn Dog s Bookshop presents Of Mice And Men , starring everybody!
eng_Latn I am afraid I liked him none the better for that
eng_Latn lay hold of each other
eng_Latn who was, indeed, too much governed by that favourite.
eng_Latn that is the sort of shell I must creep into and try to keep my soul alive in.
eng_Latn when he noticed on the back of the sheet a postscript which he had not read before.
eng_Latn he pulled up his coat collar
eng_Latn there is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to the bottom of.
eng_Latn she heaved a deep sigh of relief
eng_Latn but, no more was done.
eng_Latn Much better Pug. You read me all the way to a wonderful sleep and a VERY strange dream.
eng_Latn they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later
eng_Latn I ll be the director!
eng_Latn I don't know,' I said
eng_Latn it is time for me to go.
eng_Latn I think the naughty bookshop mice may know something about this Pug.
eng_Latn when in reality he had accomplished no more than the physical act
eng_Latn fumbling about him for his cane
eng_Latn the roof was slippery.
eng_Latn he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected.
eng_Latn my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney
eng_Latn legs thrust far forward, the wide brim of his hat set far back, making a sort of halo for his head.
eng_Latn the historian whose pen traces these words trusting that he knows his place
eng_Latn a judgment and then a distraint
eng_Latn or by one of those means by which he knew everything
eng_Latn took the platter of sausages with trembling hands.
eng_Latn I supposed he didn't need to check.
eng_Latn so he at once gave him a drubbing
eng_Latn don't be afraid.
eng_Latn he observed long life to be the universal desire and wish of mankind.
eng_Latn rattled out of the town right gallantly.
eng_Latn you should always strive to see clearly around you
eng_Latn but another stroke would settle him.
eng_Latn he can make a place for himself in my husband's factory.
eng_Latn evasions until it turned into nothing but an illusion.
eng_Latn of whom he had heard much
eng_Latn I learned that much at sea.
eng_Latn I led the way into my sitting room and asked him to sit down.
eng_Latn then, that the examination shall take place as soon as possible
eng_Latn meet with any of the natives
eng_Latn her second glance was at the dying man
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn together with a date.
eng_Latn with this he went out of the inn.
eng_Latn I think I'm gonna be sick.
eng_Latn I had quite made up my mind
eng_Latn entered or left the tavern door.
eng_Latn it is a fancy you have taken in your head
eng_Latn found himself again in the same attitude on the same paving stone of the parapet.
eng_Latn I told her my heart belongs to you
eng_Latn not suffer her reasonable hopes to be disappointed
eng_Latn he pulled himself over the overturned pickup truck
eng_Latn now going up to the fire stood with his back towards it
eng_Latn he did not like mixing with the crowd.
eng_Latn sometimes to put a suffering beast out of its misery, sometimes to fell a boar or a dingo.
eng_Latn she had no intention of stopping her trips.
eng_Latn when she came striding into view across the lawn
eng_Latn in the slow dragging ages
eng_Latn I'll get my proof for you all right.
eng_Latn ...from the in-side.
eng_Latn such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people.
eng_Latn all I knew was that I would be looking for something I couldn't see!
eng_Latn I thought about breaking his nose again.
eng_Latn how I saved his life
eng_Latn I'll never forget this.
eng_Latn Hello.
eng_Latn she managed to overcome her fear
eng_Latn it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his
eng_Latn I cant get through all the red tape
eng_Latn standing a little apart
eng_Latn he opened the door
eng_Latn take her out of the stubble
eng_Latn brought him crashing to the floor.
eng_Latn I've still got three days left.
eng_Latn for it is bitter cold.
eng_Latn I don't know,' I said
eng_Latn I didn't like it, either.
eng_Latn we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.
eng_Latn she had been recently stuffed.
eng_Latn I thought you would be hopeless
eng_Latn he had some other feelings towards women than towards grouse and foxes
eng_Latn he wrapped it up tightly.
eng_Latn he held the mastery of them even in his sleep.
eng_Latn her heart began to beat more lightly.
eng_Latn even if it had to use force for the purpose.
eng_Latn sleepy to do much before bed
eng_Latn pointed to a chair on the other side of the table and began the preliminary interrogation.
eng_Latn Magic this long table into a roundone please.
eng_Latn that he always found ready for him on the night table
eng_Latn Wild, Weird and Wonderful!
eng_Latn it is my plan to see him personally as well as to have some other people
eng_Latn Not if they re being horrible Pug. But mostly I think they re interesting.
eng_Latn I passed the barber's shop.
eng_Latn when I found my feet again
eng_Latn I ll be right back!
eng_Latn I must talk to you.
eng_Latn he began to utter profuse and doleful lamentations over her body
eng_Latn all aflame with excitement, he had flown, like a storm at the square
eng_Latn I reckon that's a considerble sight better 'n killin' of him.
eng_Latn dropped, with a sickening crack, onto its owner's head.
eng_Latn in that respect like the coat
eng_Latn I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on the fire
eng_Latn but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched.
eng_Latn but there was no time to find out.
eng_Latn I'll last a few more minutes with luck, but not much longer.
eng_Latn itting on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his saintliness.
eng_Latn I do not think so.
eng_Latn where he looked me up
eng_Latn I'm old and I'm scared and mostly I'd just like to lie right here on the home place.
eng_Latn I thank you for the warning
eng_Latn he drew the glove from his shapely white hand
eng_Latn A monkey who makes stories?
eng_Latn I am reading forbidden books.
eng_Latn its spirit spent.
eng_Latn don't turn me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!
eng_Latn it being a settled point with knights errant that when they have tried an adventure
eng_Latn pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.
eng_Latn yet I allow he preceded me in right of his post.
eng_Latn somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour boarder.
eng_Latn I wished we'd gone hunting somewhere else.
eng_Latn I must have hurt you very much.
eng_Latn I forced him to tell me.
eng_Latn you'll be offa this land when the light comes.
eng_Latn Hhhheeeeelllllp! ....
eng_Latn pretty nearly promised,moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.
eng_Latn in my own time and way.
eng_Latn but the idea was as I say.
eng_Latn who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him
eng_Latn then he raises his eyebrows.
eng_Latn I must outfit a ship to bring the treasure to the surface.
eng_Latn so papa expects, and I shall see that it is done.
eng_Latn I was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms
eng_Latn still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.
eng_Latn It's beautiful!
eng_Latn the fur vanished
eng_Latn if I do keep quiet about it now and the police find out later, it's going to look bad for me.
eng_Latn the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.
eng_Latn closed the door behind him.
eng_Latn out of college
eng_Latn I could shut my eyes an' walk right there.
eng_Latn I push my hair back off my face.
eng_Latn saw once more my native country, after an absence of five years and six months complete.
eng_Latn shut yourself up again.
eng_Latn but now I found it in vain to do so any longer.
eng_Latn I discovered what it was really made of.
eng_Latn I was thirty.
eng_Latn I'm sorry,' I said.
eng_Latn A book? A book? Sorry Pug. It's been a long day...I mean night...I mean day.
eng_Latn give me all your attention for a minute or two.
eng_Latn I must go and put the car away.
eng_Latn I looked straight ahead.
eng_Latn We ll never get them back into the hat without a fully functioning wand.
eng_Latn although he manifestly perceived, that, in order to favour them, I had concealed many particulars
eng_Latn so she again asked her what it was she was going to say before.
eng_Latn moreover, slow paced and sluggish by nature.
eng_Latn I read a lot of books Pug.
eng_Latn for though it was covered up
eng_Latn I have my reputation to protect.
eng_Latn I desired they would do me the honour to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I returned to my own country.
eng_Latn where the pots and kettles were kept.
eng_Latn nothing was said for some time.
eng_Latn how unable to defend himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts.
eng_Latn Perhaps we should do it together.
eng_Latn of how he had gone to work, been promoted
eng_Latn as many pages as he had written since his farewell to her.
eng_Latn I have a totally brilliant idea.
eng_Latn I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on.
eng_Latn I lost a husband.
eng_Latn returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.
eng_Latn think of some way by which they could meet before, if possible.
eng_Latn I'll give it you!
eng_Latn it is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.
eng_Latn together with a date.
eng_Latn he stared helplessly.
eng_Latn for the street was blocked.
eng_Latn he was unable or unwilling to tell me.
eng_Latn I have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors.
eng_Latn I know the last couple days must've been hard for you.
eng_Latn Just see a place in your mind and try to take us there.
eng_Latn that if he faltered
eng_Latn Is THIS your card?
eng_Latn an alien in a slowly unfolding dream.
eng_Latn smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings
eng_Latn before going down she went into the room where the icons hung
eng_Latn walked slowly up and down on the outer side of the sweetbriar fence
eng_Latn he resolutely began the ascent.
eng_Latn sinking into his desk chair
eng_Latn but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation.
eng_Latn I ... declare ... this bridge .... OPEN! From now on, anyone may trip trap safely across it whenever they please!
eng_Latn that saves the trouble of putting him in irons.
eng_Latn made the new furniture ghastly.
eng_Latn though they had been there a long time.
eng_Latn or that the fraction of three witty sayings lasted eighteen thousand two hundred and fifty nights
eng_Latn I made a concerted effort to focus.
eng_Latn as though this was an exclusively masculine affair and one to be handled with a minimum of words and emotions.
eng_Latn everybody in both families thought it would be better to get married soon.
eng_Latn there's something up there that 'll help them think so
eng_Latn flinging herself into a chair
eng_Latn I gave my promise, and here
eng_Latn keeling over, spilled out the standing mate.
eng_Latn I'll tell you later.
eng_Latn no more talking!
eng_Latn when life might be so very amusing in this world.
eng_Latn stripped it, and connected the alligator clamp to the end of the alarm.
eng_Latn I only remember how they began examining the witness.
eng_Latn in truth he was not made for teaching children.
eng_Latn I was in the box room at the time
eng_Latn I had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger to courts.
eng_Latn hung over us like a thunder cloud.
eng_Latn And this volcanic steam will take you there.
eng_Latn quite as if hehad not been instructed as to all this before hand
eng_Latn as if she expected to come back tomorrow.
eng_Latn I kept my temper though.
eng_Latn we at last came to something which there was no mistaking.
eng_Latn the very place in which she had been brought up
eng_Latn What a happy pencil.
eng_Latn after which, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the several maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth day return to the senate house
eng_Latn I am quite at your service.
eng_Latn but only bringing up two very small slugs.
eng_Latn I assure you mine are very different.
eng_Latn I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town.
eng_Latn she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her
eng_Latn Great.Bring them along too. Come on Pug. Let's invite some more friends from our other adventures.
eng_Latn but no one ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say.
eng_Latn I'm very shiny too.
eng_Latn till he found a low place
eng_Latn but I won't go.
eng_Latn I gave her another truth and another analogy.
eng_Latn that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit
eng_Latn that devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh
eng_Latn it was impossible to determine any responsibility.
eng_Latn but she probably wants him to herself.
eng_Latn I was hoping he might have forgotten.
eng_Latn although it is a long time on the road
eng_Latn who again and again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth and the holding of wealth
eng_Latn a man who does not even know how to carry his breeding.
eng_Latn she would keep house for him
eng_Latn not mentioning a word of my disgrace
eng_Latn I have enough without that.
eng_Latn I told her to go back to bed.
eng_Latn I don't expect you to stop it, but I do expect you to remember it!
eng_Latn who, accordingly, sat himself down, with his back to the table
eng_Latn I didn't recognize my voice when I answered.
eng_Latn her head covered
eng_Latn it's the same I saw this morning,' he returned.
eng_Latn he even tried to do up the attic with some paint which had been left behind by the painters.
eng_Latn one of whom knew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few seconds
eng_Latn I think that sand-castle was the monkey s something special.
eng_Latn her heart began to beat more lightly.
eng_Latn I also beg to return you your five hundred gulden.
eng_Latn I know the truth better than you do.
eng_Latn if you look around, I'm sure you'll find various poisons in the house.
eng_Latn I've been relieved.
eng_Latn so long as the children were not disgraced, and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position.
eng_Latn it is only that the catalogue is tedious
eng_Latn perceived that what he said about his improvement was true
eng_Latn there was no want of foresight.
eng_Latn everything must be left exactly as it is.
eng_Latn the skin was white and clear.
eng_Latn rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.
eng_Latn he found a wounded panther
eng_Latn the passing years scarcely seemed to brush it.
eng_Latn neither of the two took much heed of her.
eng_Latn while my mother, reclining by his side, rested her head on his shoulder
eng_Latn but I didn't think.
eng_Latn his honor being engaged in keeping it
eng_Latn unless he cut her off entirely.
eng_Latn to place the hat on his head.
eng_Latn sank her fingers into that satisfying hair.
eng_Latn especially on the innate submissiveness of the goose as beautifully corresponding to the strength of the gander.
eng_Latn as he was pleased to call it.
eng_Latn here he raised his hand as if unconsciously
eng_Latn This is the matter Dog.
eng_Latn I think they are wanted to complete the poet.
eng_Latn it was only yesterday that I learned how matters stood.
eng_Latn Whoopsie...
eng_Latn it is only that the catalogue is tedious
eng_Latn I didn't know how to reach you.
eng_Latn I know, ma'am.
eng_Latn but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same.
eng_Latn We ll never be lonely again!
eng_Latn till he found a low place
eng_Latn all because our bill's mounting up the whole time.
eng_Latn but he is not stupid.
eng_Latn I stroked my fingers across the keys again.
eng_Latn he threw himself upon the body of the child
eng_Latn but I felt that there was only one point which really signified.
eng_Latn he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse.
eng_Latn that he knew anything against him
eng_Latn Breath deeply.
eng_Latn then rode forward again when all the town was asleep.
eng_Latn she had little eyes, sparkling like beads, and an effusive manner.
eng_Latn accurately so that there won't be any mistakes as to their time.
eng_Latn I checked the elapsed mileage.
eng_Latn I know you'd rather keep out of this completely
eng_Latn I leaned motionlessly against the counter, trying to control myself.
eng_Latn looked into an empty field
eng_Latn he was in his mother' s bed.
eng_Latn I didn't mean to say anything.
eng_Latn on the night when I was born, and saw my dear mama.
eng_Latn I saw the window open on the left into the garden
eng_Latn I could get no sense out of the chap who cleans them.
eng_Latn I can do this.
eng_Latn stared at the ground.
eng_Latn tied it to the other side of his collar like reins over his neck
eng_Latn his head pillowed on his jacket.
eng_Latn I must think what to do.
eng_Latn was so daring and such a villain
eng_Latn having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south latitude
eng_Latn twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns
eng_Latn I never thought.
eng_Latn so that none of them could miss a word
eng_Latn where did you get it
eng_Latn I'd already put this off too long.
eng_Latn you would have been taken in
eng_Latn they discharged another volley larger than the first.
eng_Latn especially as your story is a more likely one than his?
eng_Latn I look around
eng_Latn There s nobody here. Except Colin.
eng_Latn when, looking up, her eyes met his dull despairing glance
eng_Latn but as a child I expressed my idea in the naive way recorded.
eng_Latn the thirst of agormandizer with the discretion of a judge.
eng_Latn with a sound mind.
eng_Latn I had quite made up my mind
eng_Latn Mice! Mice! Bookshop mice! Time for a game of cricket!
eng_Latn her face got animated, and she was charming.
eng_Latn he saw two long tails of yellow hair
eng_Latn as the rind wraps an orange.
eng_Latn Doris the donkey, we wish to joinyou on your mighty mission.
eng_Latn Perhaps we may be of assistance?
eng_Latn I certainly do forget to think of her
eng_Latn dressed in black
eng_Latn that she did not dare to decipher.
eng_Latn And eat a couple of the sandwiches on the way.
eng_Latn with a wand sticking out of the pocket.
eng_Latn which merely consisted of a rush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas rather than of wool.
eng_Latn I came to the battle and have lost them.
eng_Latn if you allow me to say so or yet yours.
eng_Latn And my doggy biscuit soup looks a lot cooler now too.
eng_Latn but make haste and get married, and make everything as it used to be again.
eng_Latn there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him
eng_Latn I'd like to show her around.
eng_Latn I may count on you
eng_Latn the finding of the knife near the corpse.
eng_Latn The name is Watson.
eng_Latn I made us all late
eng_Latn I'll dress him up for you as fine as you please.
eng_Latn which probably gave him the toothache.
eng_Latn then wandering up and down in fields
eng_Latn Don t worry Pug. We will tell them of their story so they ll be ready for the Big Bad Wolf!
eng_Latn I do appreciate that allowance.
eng_Latn but that he had a positive dislike for her.
eng_Latn not like the other one.
eng_Latn I found the treasure.
eng_Latn so perhaps some other poor devil has been hanged for it, long since.
eng_Latn he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead
eng_Latn I searched this room carefully before lunch.
eng_Latn she lost no time in putting a stop to it.
eng_Latn I meet a bourgeois.
eng_Latn I was comforted.
eng_Latn trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.
eng_Latn I followed her from the room.
eng_Latn but again there was no answer.
eng_Latn but the old man laughed loud and joyously
eng_Latn I can see how it might work.
eng_Latn like they had for the last three nights.
eng_Latn but at the same instant the man raised his light, which flashed in his face
eng_Latn covering the ground.
eng_Latn I didn't even think about it.
eng_Latn so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect
eng_Latn the man who had died or the woman he had left behind.
eng_Latn I am sure your dress must make you feel ill.
eng_Latn Professor Asimov, come with me!
eng_Latn you have seen enough of it.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shop that might help you with A.I.
eng_Latn but that's not enough, for you didn't believe me.
eng_Latn I wasn't gettin' nosy
eng_Latn Excellent work Pug. You have charmed the Snark.
eng_Latn not mentioning a word of my disgrace
eng_Latn I imagined it was some importunate person who
eng_Latn wishing, in her immediate doubt of finding him at home
eng_Latn reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another.
eng_Latn watching his father narrowly.
eng_Latn he must depart from the country.
eng_Latn her father had mentioned the telegram
eng_Latn Er, about that Pug...
eng_Latn so he was thinking about her and her husband.
eng_Latn checkmated in this general way, was at a loss as to how to proceed.
eng_Latn the figure almost too graceful.
eng_Latn I danced there one evening.
eng_Latn he opened up the most hidden passageways of his heart
eng_Latn it was nasty!
eng_Latn pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed doors.
eng_Latn mounted his horse
eng_Latn touched the glass with it
eng_Latn with whom I have to do
eng_Latn placed the summum bonum was in the gifts of nature
eng_Latn enjoining on her that it must all be kept from her father
eng_Latn You have a monster?
eng_Latn I'd like to show her around.
eng_Latn Sometimes the best bit about a mystery is that it's mysterious, and if it stays mysterious it's never over.
eng_Latn the doors of heaven opened to her.
eng_Latn So to sum up - there s no spies. But the picnic real, right?
eng_Latn that, instead of a cap or hat, he has two immense horns on hishead.
eng_Latn to ask her any questionin the book, and she would answer it.
eng_Latn I pulled my wallet from my jeans pocket
eng_Latn I love you, and I don't care for anything,
eng_Latn let us go to dinner.
eng_Latn but, suddenly, as though remembering something, he stopped short.
eng_Latn hurried to the shore toward the town.
eng_Latn shading his face with his hand.
eng_Latn till to morrow, he muttered to himself, and you, he added, addressing his visitor
eng_Latn this sombrebuilding had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him.
eng_Latn I am not a model clergyman only a decent makeshift.
eng_Latn I just want to have sex!
eng_Latn I trusted her.
eng_Latn but he never received the response he longed for
eng_Latn we may be able to save her.
eng_Latn to terrify any person who should attempt the same thing,
eng_Latn was in danger
eng_Latn meticulously and very properly.
eng_Latn I wondered if she'd even bothered to go in?
eng_Latn I say, stop there.
eng_Latn Hey Presto?
eng_Latn but because she was a foolish and unbalanced woman.
eng_Latn well stitched together with hempen threads of my own making.
eng_Latn that he would take from me the heart of the girl I love.
eng_Latn in this way we shall be satisfied and easy
eng_Latn her mother had come outside to take it right before school started.
eng_Latn I don't want to go with you.
eng_Latn yelped even louder.
eng_Latn This is a book..
eng_Latn took us for ghosts or devils
eng_Latn they pitched on some beautiful legend or fairy story, and turned it upside down.
eng_Latn that I shouldn't dare to be so presumptuous as to feel either pity or contempt for him.
eng_Latn all dressed in their best.
eng_Latn but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
eng_Latn then all the results of her yearning, but possibly mistaken, dreams would
eng_Latn Put me DOWN, I said! I'm on a very important mission!
eng_Latn by my free will
eng_Latn had had by her three sons
eng_Latn I am afraid this story happened before you became my friend Pug.
eng_Latn I'll say this for him, he always has good licker.
eng_Latn he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes,
eng_Latn legs thrust far forward, the wide brim of his hat set far back, making a sort of halo for his head.
eng_Latn I come to a halt as I hear a sound.
eng_Latn I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion.
eng_Latn I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.
eng_Latn who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed.
eng_Latn to receive the spiritual renewal of condolences
eng_Latn I have, at least, a well polished, silver plated coffee pot in front of me
eng_Latn I thought you were probably the man with the broken glasses and the queer philosophy.
eng_Latn I was the one she said yes to.
eng_Latn which the performers acted with such wonderfully effective truth
eng_Latn but you have made my mouth water
eng_Latn I shall kill myself, because I loathe everything!
eng_Latn stumbling and tripping
eng_Latn he hated her for being alive while the other was dead.
eng_Latn for a man he was to her
eng_Latn who would hem him in from two sides.
eng_Latn this was to be the home of her wifehood
eng_Latn I walked to the window, across the room
eng_Latn I look out of the window
eng_Latn held the receiver a foot away from his ear
eng_Latn from which place, he was to despatch, a constable and doctor.
eng_Latn but relatively of such was their nature.
eng_Latn that he began his first caresses with so much care that his suggestion that she put on her nightdress seemed natural to her.
eng_Latn he went off to get skates.
eng_Latn after attending to their masters, had supper
eng_Latn I mean, I'd rather take my chances with the monsters.
eng_Latn for instance, just because she worked in the mill.
eng_Latn I'm afraid there is nothing to find out.
eng_Latn for I have as much soul as another
eng_Latn wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground.
eng_Latn it cannot be more
eng_Latn whose springs wailed like an animal in heat.
eng_Latn they were sure of themselves.
eng_Latn she would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly.
eng_Latn That was my foot!
eng_Latn worth forty cents in those easy times
eng_Latn Dog! Dog! Come up to the roof. I can see a something.
eng_Latn the other's that cub that
eng_Latn not since that night in the barn after the police had brought him home.
eng_Latn I would go up and they would censure me, and I would burst out laughing in their faces.
eng_Latn I don't really remember.
eng_Latn Is that you Pug?
eng_Latn but, no more was done.
eng_Latn it incited him.
eng_Latn by whom they were entertained and treated like kings.
eng_Latn one of them was dangling off its hinges.
eng_Latn but he could read people like a book.
eng_Latn I want him to go away
eng_Latn I bent down to go in, like a goose under a gate
eng_Latn but was still extremely nervous
eng_Latn so you'd better get packed.
eng_Latn determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.
eng_Latn I dragged myself as far as the yard.
eng_Latn And I am very happy you re such a good friend Pug. You ve been brave in lots of ways today, especially reading your first book to me. Would you read a little more please?
eng_Latn but you did,
eng_Latn slipped out into the entrance hall.
eng_Latn I couldn't do without her.
eng_Latn coming from the wing?
eng_Latn so as to throw no blame on any one.
eng_Latn I made bold to desire my conductor, that he would be pleased to explain to me
eng_Latn when tired with my constant labor at the same thing and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten
eng_Latn pulled on the spare ones
eng_Latn I am dreadfully afraid.
eng_Latn he and his son arrived next day.
eng_Latn consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them.
eng_Latn I like a man with hidden depths.
eng_Latn but still his affairs did not improve.
eng_Latn caring with the same urgency and the same violence that animated them before the war had cut their lives in two.
eng_Latn with this mere attempt I shall rest satisfied
eng_Latn it was trivial
eng_Latn but, which, instead of containing gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum.
eng_Latn but he had not yet hit the bulls's eye twenty times out of twenty two.
eng_Latn hurrying along the corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go
eng_Latn I must have, I suppose.
eng_Latn Dog. Dog. I’ve invented a new kind of soap that smells like dog food so I won’t mind having a wash!
eng_Latn I knowit takes some getting used to.
eng_Latn Would a doggy biscuit help Dog?
eng_Latn although already beyond his depth in regard to this.
eng_Latn held by young men or girls or old men or middle aged women
eng_Latn I should be in heels, of course, she says, without stopping.
eng_Latn as she did
eng_Latn objections till at last
eng_Latn It's what makes her the captain.
eng_Latn revealed the crime, and, finally
eng_Latn so you just must come and take me away.
eng_Latn My latest painting. Rubbish isn tit?
eng_Latn standing a little apart
eng_Latn are not too much
eng_Latn TEST NUMBER THREE. ALL UNICORNS ARE VERY, POPULAR, SO YOU MUST PROVE YOU HAVE LOTS OF FRIENDS!
eng_Latn I rose from the thanksgiving
eng_Latn with proper masters, and could want nothing more.
eng_Latn I let the car run down the hill slowly.
eng_Latn her lifetime dream.
eng_Latn she laughed, a little ruefully.
eng_Latn but I can see a slight flicker of annoyance pass across his face.
eng_Latn for she was naturally tender hearted.
eng_Latn but at present I do not see what there is to question.
eng_Latn I knew she was dead.
eng_Latn or earth nourishment.
eng_Latn as was shown by a trifling incident.
eng_Latn that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight.
eng_Latn but something huge and merciless struck her on the head and rolled her on her back.
eng_Latn WHERE ARE WE?
eng_Latn that the young man did not say my father
eng_Latn clinking the handcuffs together.
eng_Latn anyways it don't if she don't cry.
eng_Latn in excuse for leaning down her face
eng_Latn you can fit into almost any society.
eng_Latn she turned quickly to hide them and left the room.
eng_Latn would not she give him her influence in procuring it?
eng_Latn I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him
eng_Latn it cost fifty.
eng_Latn ran for it with all their might.
eng_Latn I smiled ruefully.
eng_Latn removed it to a little distance from the owner.
eng_Latn looked at my aunt like an amiable bird.
eng_Latn one of them was dangling off its hinges.
eng_Latn however virtuous he may be.
eng_Latn I lied to him and I married him.
eng_Latn as he worked toward the center of the log the axe head disappeared entirely inside the cut
eng_Latn who would hem him in from two sides.
eng_Latn I was expecting you! I was expecting you!
eng_Latn Wow-Bowzer! There are now MORE footprints in the snow. While we ve been running around the mountains, the Yeti s been running around this tree!
eng_Latn she is loved and served by such a knight as your worship seems to be.
eng_Latn pulling up the rug he flung himself back on the pillow.
eng_Latn that suspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it.
eng_Latn I'm sure I'm not sorry he's dead.
eng_Latn you know, the very first time we met.
eng_Latn only to let the world know that while thou dost favour me there is no impossibility I will not attempt and accomplish.
eng_Latn I am left none the worse of it
eng_Latn found he had not yet ceased to breathe.
eng_Latn that was how he came to be put in charge of the prince.
eng_Latn but you have only to search for yourself
eng_Latn she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
eng_Latn the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist.
eng_Latn I've never heard those words before.
eng_Latn though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him.
eng_Latn but that I differed very much from the rest of my species in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness of my skin
eng_Latn as though he had grave doubts whether this game were worth the candle.
eng_Latn she may be constant.
eng_Latn you needn't fear.
eng_Latn I took a step forward.
eng_Latn the old man is as surly as a dog.
eng_Latn I feel like a princess. I feel like a movie star.
eng_Latn you can go and get on with it
eng_Latn Are you all right, Pug?
eng_Latn seeing it was no use
eng_Latn his mother helped him out twice
eng_Latn I kept my temper though.
eng_Latn I gestured for her to follow me.
eng_Latn his face was quite composed.
eng_Latn Flap away! Flap away!
eng_Latn Thank you. You aren t a scary monster at all.
eng_Latn I had not seen him for four years, and had never met his wife.
eng_Latn one of the enemy actually fell
eng_Latn Everyone wants to sit near the King but they can t on that long table so they shout! I had to sneak out for some peace and quiet on this solitary rock.
eng_Latn I don't care how merry you are at my expense this morning
eng_Latn catching my eye and looking away.
eng_Latn to denote his gentlemanly rank on board.
eng_Latn by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity
eng_Latn but my mother wouldn't let her do it, and made her dine with us.
eng_Latn my mother asked me all about the day I had had, and what they had said and done.
eng_Latn we don't mind how hard the truth is for the neighbors outside our walls.
eng_Latn paused not once for breath
eng_Latn if I am victorious
eng_Latn looked down at the tray of bright green trees.
eng_Latn I've caught the secret.
eng_Latn so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dollars a month.
eng_Latn a farrier's bill!
eng_Latn followed the count into the room
eng_Latn but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me, after I was set on the table
eng_Latn gave orders for a table and chairs to be taken into the garden under the chestnut tree, and lunch to be laid there.
eng_Latn making the odour exhale, and scumming off the saliva.
eng_Latn her face battered and one eye swollen shut.
eng_Latn once more he kisses her hands
eng_Latn tiny and vulnerable.
eng_Latn if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a tolerable sick rat.
eng_Latn including a matronly woman who just came in to pay her bill before going on to pass the disease to her entire bridge club.
eng_Latn now stood thereunable for the moment to think of anything more to say.
eng_Latn What spies? What castle? What about the picnic?
eng_Latn with his mouth close to her ear.
eng_Latn accurately so that there won't be any mistakes as to their time.
eng_Latn are not too much
eng_Latn we've got lots ter do tomorrow,
eng_Latn I glanced at the angry mob, too
eng_Latn I hope we don t have to add them up!
eng_Latn but never will I lean on a staff again.
eng_Latn he roared, and the whole class jumped again.
eng_Latn I appreciate your coming.
eng_Latn especially because her raised hand of an archangelic messenger was moving with the swaying of the cart.
eng_Latn all into this breast transfer their pains
eng_Latn we can get a station wagon, put him in the back, and go on
eng_Latn there I found my mother in good health and spirits.
eng_Latn he should have a run of luck
eng_Latn one apparently contained the two bazookas
eng_Latn flapped the reins.
eng_Latn so I come down the back way.
eng_Latn Hmm hmm
eng_Latn stepping barefooted and straight as an arrow, with braids of raven hair, a thick, haughty profile
eng_Latn till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches.
eng_Latn he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! Let's Wow-bowzer! If weall cry your cry Granny Pug perhaps the Yeti will come out and say hello.
eng_Latn almost horrified him.
eng_Latn but I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.
eng_Latn when, looking up, her eyes met his dull despairing glance
eng_Latn anything but suspense!
eng_Latn but then, she wasn't always like that, either.
eng_Latn Can I spit it out now?
eng_Latn but on the other hand I am very easy to get on with.
eng_Latn It's Angry Monkey Island too!
eng_Latn but if you can't keep up your end, we will stand our loss, of course,
eng_Latn the results have, I fear, been negative.
eng_Latn he set out alone on his fourteen miles' journey
eng_Latn would not she give him her influence in procuring it?
eng_Latn poor scrubby midshipman as I am.
eng_Latn hold our breath
eng_Latn having the other firmly grasped by his companion
eng_Latn out of the war he carried two memories.
eng_Latn humbly answered that I was my master's slave.
eng_Latn she turned on her heel and ran, ran all the way up the corridor and out of sight.
eng_Latn amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
eng_Latn You should try using some brightercolours too. All this blue is a bitblue.
eng_Latn for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her
eng_Latn I heard the music before I was out of the car.
eng_Latn allowed him to proceed, and he continued
eng_Latn he finally managed to say.
eng_Latn stopped to take counsel together.
eng_Latn I've been doing it all day here.
eng_Latn I can look forward to no better happiness than that which would be one with yours.
eng_Latn watch me spit in your eye!
eng_Latn First I will make a blue sky. Oh my!
eng_Latn I hope you enjoy a long, happy, boring life.
eng_Latn whether you would belong there or not.
eng_Latn I trust, however, that the time here has not been passed unpleasantly to you.
eng_Latn Hoh! We appear to have offended someone s pets.
eng_Latn I knew it! Power hungry aliens have taken our electricity to fly their space craft!
eng_Latn A party with balloons, streamers and doggie biscuits!
eng_Latn to see two of the girls in jeans approaching our table.
eng_Latn but had her reasons.
eng_Latn But most of all and worst of all...
eng_Latn I was wide awake every time.
eng_Latn I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles more, was too much for me.
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds!
eng_Latn a bit of love from someone!
eng_Latn forgive me for the deceit I have practised on you!
eng_Latn I must not simply retreat before him
eng_Latn bent his eyes upon me, as if he would have burnt me up with them.
eng_Latn Buckle up boys.
eng_Latn went in the darkness
eng_Latn never pushed his own button which would have brought the nurse running.
eng_Latn took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whaleboat
eng_Latn And I think I never saw my friend so happy as that foggy day when we solved his most baffling case.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book, and it's given me an idea. Bookshop mices! I know a game we can play together.
eng_Latn I can't believe you missed the game last night just to watch somebody sleep
eng_Latn close enough that I felt the heat of her breath on my lips.
eng_Latn but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges
eng_Latn I've got a notion, and I think it's a sound one.
eng_Latn as her father put one of his fat fingers into the hand of the child she was dancing on the counter.
eng_Latn suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand
eng_Latn I'm going to read every book in the bookshop AGAIN!
eng_Latn then he jerked his head around to look again.
eng_Latn snatched up a pair of binoculars, and stepped to the window.
eng_Latn I think it's time we checked youramazing fact Pug.
eng_Latn finally fallen asleep
eng_Latn there is no room for fear on this lighter.
eng_Latn I never rightly liked to hear it since.
eng_Latn I no longer understand anything.
eng_Latn but an opening which made him congratulate himself on his foresight in bringing with him his eighty pounds.
eng_Latn I lied to him and I married him.
eng_Latn the very place in which she had been brought up
eng_Latn imagine that he has completely deceived us.
eng_Latn but I was meanin' anythin' unusual a bit nearer home
eng_Latn Welcome to Big Burger. Home of the Big Burger.
eng_Latn LET S HUNT SNARK!
eng_Latn I got a feelin' I oughta go away an' let 'em be.
eng_Latn he was at liberty to wander about the house.
eng_Latn so that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.
eng_Latn growing confused, and constantly losing the thread of his ideas.
eng_Latn they'll be ready for repotting again
eng_Latn you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket.
eng_Latn he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.
eng_Latn who was less corpulent than his father
eng_Latn when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a MAN along.
eng_Latn I'd stopped writing to after two or three months.
eng_Latn I begged she would not give herself so much trouble.
eng_Latn I shall kill myself, because I loathe everything!
eng_Latn without making any sound at all she kept on shouting inside her head for the glass to go over.
eng_Latn just listen for a moment.
eng_Latn he was compelled to return to his room and make it out there
eng_Latn his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished,was the one condition'fully intelligible now'that her father had attached to their betrothal
eng_Latn when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black
eng_Latn a bottle of wine, and two glasses
eng_Latn I'm going with them.
eng_Latn Yes! Yes! A kite! I see it now. I think.
eng_Latn I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can.
eng_Latn he'll soon detest you as much as I do.
eng_Latn I can help them.
eng_Latn there's the window and the rod
eng_Latn he began to snore.
eng_Latn take the box out of the sea into the ship, and so into the captain's cabin.
eng_Latn than I should be for not wanting a leg or an arm
eng_Latn we both soon slumbered.
eng_Latn except that she was so headstrong.
eng_Latn who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his daughter.
eng_Latn was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so.
eng_Latn by an immediate alteration of the will, should be secured at his death.
eng_Latn my heat has melted thee to anger glow.
eng_Latn This cat is an amazing cook... for cats!
eng_Latn give me a bit more time.
eng_Latn I can answer for its being so on his.
eng_Latn I nodded and opened the container.
eng_Latn there was no longer anything to spare.
eng_Latn he slumped back onto his pillows and fell asleep.
eng_Latn but decided not to.
eng_Latn I do want it.
eng_Latn he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled
eng_Latn I held it out so that he could see it.
eng_Latn for the first time in public, and with an uncontrolled voracity
eng_Latn if the reader puts all his intelligence at our service
eng_Latn I'm very disappointed in you.
eng_Latn but my young way was never the way to age.
eng_Latn yet so well set out was it that it seemed that every part had room to spread itself fittingly
eng_Latn yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest.
eng_Latn it was her way of feeling her sway over it.
eng_Latn I come to a halt as I hear a sound.
eng_Latn he went down that night.
eng_Latn though there seemed no chance
eng_Latn I fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university.
eng_Latn I don't mind going back to the store.
eng_Latn there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear.
eng_Latn I want to know why I'm lying for you.
eng_Latn I tried again.
eng_Latn she hastened from the room.
eng_Latn naturally, I'll see that you're taken care of.
eng_Latn answered that there were a great many of them about there.
eng_Latn Chased by her!
eng_Latn hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.
eng_Latn We ve had an eventful morning here so far. Jack and Jill took a tumble during the cross country race. And Tweedledum and Tweedledee were given a telling off for squabbling in the crowd.
eng_Latn he knew that sooner or later he would step across it
eng_Latn I mustn't beg.
eng_Latn maybe you've heard?
eng_Latn but sadder, without his gentleness.
eng_Latn I should never like to return to it.
eng_Latn our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the first.
eng_Latn I will keep your secret for myself alone.
eng_Latn she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
eng_Latn turned round at the sudden sound of the sash, before she called to him.
eng_Latn Not quite what I planned....
eng_Latn Can you read us home with your book Dog?
eng_Latn they agreed not to touch upon any point connected with knight errantry
eng_Latn he came to me.
eng_Latn out of which there jumped a fat gentleman
eng_Latn we'll set the candle on the stairs.
eng_Latn I wheel round furiously round to face him.
eng_Latn held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison.
eng_Latn he had two undersecretaries.
