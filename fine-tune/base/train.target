eng_Latn they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet.
eng_Latn hand raised in the signal that everything was fine
eng_Latn the marshal of another district, who belonged to their party.
eng_Latn you give her an autographed picture.
eng_Latn taking the grass grown path by which we had come.
eng_Latn for it is a matter of the deepest importance
eng_Latn he must be found
eng_Latn after that there was no doing anything with him.
eng_Latn A book token? A bookmark?
eng_Latn as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend.
eng_Latn for the purpose of truly solving the question of the defendant's guilt or in nocence.
eng_Latn I assured her we were alone.
eng_Latn she wished to bid him adieu
eng_Latn advancing to the bed's head
eng_Latn Puzzle solved. Thank you, Minotaur and Thessie, this has been a wonderful adventure.
eng_Latn but his presence would simplify matters.
eng_Latn but my poor history pervaded it all.
eng_Latn I was tired of doing much the same thing every day.
eng_Latn but the officer assumed the responsibility of letting her have a fifteen minute stay.
eng_Latn was a glad piece of news
eng_Latn threw it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet
eng_Latn he was hunched, as if with age or weakness
eng_Latn I haven't seen it all afternoon.
eng_Latn as he shuts the gate behind him and walks slowly along the street.
eng_Latn his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished.
eng_Latn wounded men, each of whom, still fighting and still resisting, is expending all his blood.
eng_Latn the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed.
eng_Latn came on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story.
eng_Latn I'd rather risk whatever could happen
eng_Latn he and I being close together, near some dwarf apple trees
eng_Latn then quickly tiptoe back towards the front door.
eng_Latn then turned away and paid no more attention to him or his costume.
eng_Latn the others had to take great care to restrain their laughter
eng_Latn but there's a thing that could be the sun.
eng_Latn all equal, each working according to his capacity
eng_Latn so to propitiate the austere spirit of poetry
eng_Latn This is a book about a specialsomething they wear at sea, and it is called...
eng_Latn I swears on this picture of me dearold mum, one day I ll be captain.
eng_Latn more especially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease
eng_Latn after urging him not to strip himself of his property
eng_Latn to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours
eng_Latn I put on my smile again.
eng_Latn our men did what they felt they had to do.
eng_Latn the sight of themselves from which no flame of life will ever leap!
eng_Latn call out the militia.
eng_Latn leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well
eng_Latn This robot is also a waffle maker.
eng_Latn you might be in for it now, if anybody informed against you.
eng_Latn wondered why he didn't feel more scared.
eng_Latn I suppose you angered him somehow?
eng_Latn Just my poor kite.
eng_Latn it turned what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic.
eng_Latn they are none the less TRUE.
eng_Latn they took the spade and the pick there.
eng_Latn I haven't forgotten it and I never shall!
eng_Latn I don't remember everything as it happened.
eng_Latn when he hasn't got a principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by others than of getting his own toes pinched.
eng_Latn I would rather die a hundred times oh, yes, die!
eng_Latn as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.
eng_Latn knocked over his lamp
eng_Latn the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom
eng_Latn that vulture the very creature he creates.
eng_Latn keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties that have been already declared to you.
eng_Latn it was still considered improper for a lady to drive a car.
eng_Latn having evidently reflected and decided how to act
eng_Latn she felt something like bashful timidity before a superior
eng_Latn don't keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an end of bringing them over this twelvemonth.
eng_Latn And I know how to do it.
eng_Latn turning his handsome, good natured face to her.
eng_Latn but ended by agreeing to sell part of her property.
eng_Latn Hahah Can I have another go please?
eng_Latn for which they were both grateful
eng_Latn ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs.
eng_Latn the historian whose pen traces these words trusting that he knows his place
eng_Latn I wouldn't have one in my house.
eng_Latn as long as they didn't fly too high.
eng_Latn that is why you, in your turn, are to die
eng_Latn who had his back towards her at the time.
eng_Latn but suddenly his glance was transferred
eng_Latn course of treachery and deception
eng_Latn because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued.
eng_Latn an eddy of loneliness washed over him.
eng_Latn not because of a juvenile way station along her road.
eng_Latn he'll be my ruin.
eng_Latn before he could mount, he went on his knees before him
eng_Latn with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the person referred to.
eng_Latn I remember they counted backward so they'd do it at the same time.
eng_Latn but perhaps the man who had just gone away.
eng_Latn thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence
eng_Latn knowing the old one wouldnt dry out anyway.
eng_Latn Yip! What s happening Dog?
eng_Latn another third were his intimate chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances.
eng_Latn I'm sure you are fond of each other ' er ' very deep down.
eng_Latn steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother's.
eng_Latn I will do my best.
eng_Latn I am certain that, as soon as ever I 'begin to play for myself' and I still have 120 gulden left, I shall win.
eng_Latn he struggled painfully to his feet
eng_Latn so that the time was propitious for my excursion.
eng_Latn whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be conveyed.
eng_Latn followed by his wife
eng_Latn how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls
eng_Latn found things going on much as he had left them.
eng_Latn but I look upon it as difficult.
eng_Latn I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction to your friends,
eng_Latn you will then need to come here
eng_Latn I haven t got to that bit yet.
eng_Latn I thought this was a ship Granny.
eng_Latn as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only
eng_Latn I like order in everything
eng_Latn Welcome, welcome. My "Mino-Tea Shop" has been open for ages, and you re my first ever visitors. I keep calling for people to come by for a cupcake and cuppa. But you re the only ones who ve ever showed up. Please, help yourselves.
eng_Latn impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.
eng_Latn judgment being always equivalent to an unspecified sum in hard cash.
eng_Latn but let us make haste, and reach my village
eng_Latn I should throw myself into the water.
eng_Latn would not be back before the morning.
eng_Latn she had never seen so large a room as this in her life.
eng_Latn went out of the room with meekly downcast eyes.
eng_Latn there I shall be quiet and unmolested.
eng_Latn the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order
eng_Latn thou must make them thyself, man.
eng_Latn nothing distressed us so much
eng_Latn I'm frightfully busy.
eng_Latn he almost knocked the tray from my hands.
eng_Latn or simply so as not to get out of practice.
eng_Latn I think it will be better if we drop you.
eng_Latn other names are on the wrappers of the pledges
eng_Latn two men were removing paintings from the walls of the drawing room.
eng_Latn so terrifying the neatness of that other death which exists within death
eng_Latn This is a book by...
eng_Latn smelled it again
eng_Latn I have a single wish, and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it.
eng_Latn one of the enemy actually fell
eng_Latn he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended.
eng_Latn beach her quietly there.
eng_Latn Sweet dreams!
eng_Latn but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once.
eng_Latn Yip! Whaaat waaaas thatttt Dogggg?
eng_Latn again overcome with confusion and looking down.
eng_Latn you were quaintly dressed much as you are now.
eng_Latn I heard several bangs or buffets
eng_Latn but pardon me, if I cannot even endeavour to persuade him.
eng_Latn I'll get picked up for indecent exposure.
eng_Latn right they are
eng_Latn so that, in case he was driven to use the dog
eng_Latn graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night.
eng_Latn lost her head and did not know what to do.
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn ten more heads are worth having.
eng_Latn he of course expected me to tell you of it.
eng_Latn tell me what may have passed between you and her conditions which
eng_Latn if it were not enough we were to let her know
eng_Latn as he was certain of being tortured.
eng_Latn it is not my nature.
eng_Latn a clean hair brush and frantic wavings in front of an open fire.
eng_Latn I shouldn't have asked you to stay here on any other condition.
eng_Latn I handed her the photo on her way out.
eng_Latn trying to force him to accept a gold peso for the second visit
eng_Latn where nothing had happened for four centuries
eng_Latn what they were like
eng_Latn then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat.
eng_Latn roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as
eng_Latn Nearly...almost...
eng_Latn I put it just here.
eng_Latn the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.
eng_Latn no one had promised them.
eng_Latn I looked into my still full coffee cup.
eng_Latn also how while still employed at the first of these places he had written his mother .
eng_Latn A round table? I wanted fire and flame, not furniture!
eng_Latn fists clenched, anticipating an attack.
eng_Latn Hello! Hello
eng_Latn I was shown up to a nice little bedroom, with DOLPHIN painted on the door.
eng_Latn but merely bowed.
eng_Latn I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.
eng_Latn And I think these sticks meansomething important. Let us explore more.
eng_Latn but today it has surpassed my expectations.
eng_Latn I thought perhaps you didn't want to be spoken to.
eng_Latn I quitted the chamber.
eng_Latn whom he considered the most honorable man he had ever known
eng_Latn it had quite gone out of her.
eng_Latn but things seemed to have stopped.
eng_Latn I don't mean to submit tamely to insult and robbery.
eng_Latn but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened
eng_Latn I tried to drive him before me and bring him to you
eng_Latn for these too will get faded
eng_Latn except through cowardice,
eng_Latn then he tore into that leg.
eng_Latn Sorry Mr Piccolo.
eng_Latn how sensible the sound was
eng_Latn their ways arose out of the condition of the time.
eng_Latn to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants.
eng_Latn In a certain village in La Mancha,which I shall not name, there lived not long ago
eng_Latn then all the young clerks in town in a body
eng_Latn In perfect peace and...
eng_Latn temperature 45 degrees
eng_Latn confronting the people of their times with their preconceived notions.
eng_Latn were too much interested in themselves to pay much attention to him now.
eng_Latn how she would love him become quite different
eng_Latn I longed vainly.
eng_Latn waking her from her previous stupidity and incurious self absorbed ignorance about her husband's relation to others.
eng_Latn I've been storing things back there
eng_Latn some sudden catastrophe had occurred, and that he was almost the cause of it, because he had read the article aloud.
eng_Latn Helpful bloke-iness is what I do!
eng_Latn like me, has come casually here to be drawn into the events for which his scepticism as well as mine seems to entertain a sort of passive contempt.
eng_Latn something had happened to the ignition.
eng_Latn but needless to say that
eng_Latn or man's countenance is no longer to be relied on.
eng_Latn she felt that clearly.
eng_Latn The End Of The World... The Middle Ages... In The Beginning!
eng_Latn see if you can manage to tell me the truth.
eng_Latn outlined, with considerable exactness, a gibbet laid flat on theground.
eng_Latn I sort of set it free without meaning to
eng_Latn for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him.
eng_Latn I suppressed a sigh.
eng_Latn I was intrigued.
eng_Latn I was gonna go tom cattin''an' here I ain't had time to do none of them things.
eng_Latn WILL YOU STOP FIDGETING!
eng_Latn terror impeded her breathing.
eng_Latn thout any more feeling than if he was a human!
eng_Latn Mr Picasso was going to become oneof the greatest artists in the world but now he wants to give it up and play the squeezebox!
eng_Latn was foolish to be helping anybody else in this way particularly a working man.
eng_Latn I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news immensely.
eng_Latn I am only telling you what it is.
eng_Latn it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners
eng_Latn it's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.
eng_Latn but stood at the toilet table near the window
eng_Latn brought him crashing to the floor.
eng_Latn then almost with one impulse the congregation rose
eng_Latn upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily
eng_Latn let us take leave of the castellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.
eng_Latn to feed'if he could find food
eng_Latn he could not decide which, so elaborately intertwined was the engraved penmanship.
eng_Latn Actually it's quite good.
eng_Latn but it would make him yearn for her all the more.
eng_Latn for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory water he made but one sleep of it, and
eng_Latn I'll get my proof for you all right.
eng_Latn except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked
eng_Latn many of which died at sea
eng_Latn because I wait upon him alone in his room now.
eng_Latn I just have to keep walking and hope that I eventually find my way out by blind luck.
eng_Latn I was caught off guard by the wave of emotion that crashed over me.
eng_Latn then he let him go, and proceeded to fine each of the girls five dollars
eng_Latn I'm going to make a big request of you today, he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, so I thought you ought to know something about me.
eng_Latn but I offered him good wages.
eng_Latn I really think this must be a man!
eng_Latn I could have you arrested for that.
eng_Latn which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.
eng_Latn I was so tense I almost growled the words.
eng_Latn at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe.
eng_Latn yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment.
eng_Latn how long he was in the creature's clutches
eng_Latn I like rudeness a great deal better than flattery.
eng_Latn here capacity and sound judgment come in
eng_Latn my genius for good or evil waited there in humble guise.
eng_Latn There s a lion.
eng_Latn following hard upon the footsteps of our friend.
eng_Latn I suppose you thought you'd keep the money, if I did!
eng_Latn but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.
eng_Latn I'll be your slave now, your slave for the rest of my life.
eng_Latn for, upon some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.
eng_Latn how sparklingly blue was the sky.
eng_Latn somehow or other he saw her now at her worst
eng_Latn calling to my mother.
eng_Latn the smile ended in a tear.
eng_Latn they would remember him.
eng_Latn I 'uz mos' to de foot er de islan' b'fo' I found' a good place.
eng_Latn Come back Dog!
eng_Latn I thought of the convict out upon the bleak, cold, shelterless moor.
eng_Latn I reached out for her free hand, taking it in both of mine.
eng_Latn when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship's side.
eng_Latn an anguished chill at the thought of it affecting him almostobservably.
eng_Latn guilt or innocence merely an academic question.
eng_Latn I wrenched at it more desperately still.
eng_Latn it's better to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all.
eng_Latn that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment
eng_Latn of love from men I don't know and never shall know, for the love of these men here
eng_Latn at last I took the boldness to reach my hand towards his neck with a design to stroke it
eng_Latn till they just fell down an' passed out.
eng_Latn I have been young, you will be old.
eng_Latn Noises like that are never good.
eng_Latn dark like the fallow earth that waits for the good seed
eng_Latn who would like to pass himself off as an idiot, but who will not succeed in so doing
eng_Latn but man, in the ideal, is so noble and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature
eng_Latn holding up the light in his left hand
eng_Latn the old man is as surly as a dog.
eng_Latn vaguely recollecting she had heard some similar saying from someone.
eng_Latn streaked back toward the ground.
eng_Latn then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands.
eng_Latn but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed
eng_Latn he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the lips.
eng_Latn I don't conduct this inquiry for my own amusement.
eng_Latn for I will set it to rights at the first village where there is a blacksmith
eng_Latn came to join the dancers on the terrace.
eng_Latn which I spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.
eng_Latn but, after all, he didn't burn the house
eng_Latn I'm sorry, sorry for that fine fellow.
eng_Latn without another word or waiting for a reply he made off home.
eng_Latn she was very stealthily, drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eyes
eng_Latn when the matter was debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion.
eng_Latn he reminded me, his voice exultant
eng_Latn the smell of fowls, and the inevitable smell of decomposition.
eng_Latn already he had changed his tone.
eng_Latn I just had a dream.
eng_Latn I said to restart the conversation so that I could hear her voice again.
eng_Latn I got a note saying they expected me to come there again to day for dinner sure.
eng_Latn then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny
eng_Latn has left the book in the prison in pawn for two hundred reals.
eng_Latn so that you'll get two reports in the hour
eng_Latn I've seen him.
eng_Latn The Wumpus Pug.
eng_Latn I was not to be assured immortal life.
eng_Latn or some one coming along who hasseen him there.
eng_Latn just so she could know what it said.
eng_Latn not daring to kindle a fire, for fear of being discovered by the natives.
eng_Latn possibly a fox.
eng_Latn I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself
eng_Latn the odor in the house was sufficient proof
eng_Latn but probably unaware of it.
eng_Latn he presently recovered his spirits and good humour
eng_Latn how this affair stood between the two men.
eng_Latn repeating the _hhuun_, _hhuun_, as he did upon the road
eng_Latn think that he may never have known a mother's love, or the comfort of a home
eng_Latn please don't apologize.
eng_Latn I flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him.
eng_Latn but what they grow to be!
eng_Latn when, looking all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's shanty
eng_Latn I'm going to be the first pug at The Pole!
eng_Latn deserted from the front
eng_Latn as showing that even a beadle
eng_Latn I untied my shorts and yanked them on, already running for the house.
eng_Latn if she does when she's talking to me.
eng_Latn but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate companion with him
eng_Latn he was a dairy farmer.
eng_Latn so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom
eng_Latn for she had answered him so angrily and harshly
eng_Latn I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.
eng_Latn looking at her sister in law
eng_Latn then she looked at him
eng_Latn I leaned back against the wall and then slid to the ground.
eng_Latn but I should learn to understand these pictures sooner than yours with the very wide meaning
eng_Latn Uhh. Can t reach. I know!
eng_Latn how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision
eng_Latn when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.
eng_Latn whereof I soon felt the unhappy effect
eng_Latn rsula was the only one who dared disturb his, abstraction.
eng_Latn he answered, frowning.
eng_Latn then the crowd surging out but only towait at the courtroom door in order to glimpse
eng_Latn his body was like a hunted animal fleeing before its captors.
eng_Latn the fourth in six years
eng_Latn at least long enough for the child to mature and bear children of its own.
eng_Latn did they have the opportunity to speak to each other.
eng_Latn assured her that he was not comparing.
eng_Latn now gazed at him, fascinated by his enthusiasms.
eng_Latn Bumpy books...Lumpy books...Books that come with a torch!
eng_Latn to ask him what he had said.
eng_Latn that she was in his confidence that night.
eng_Latn but sat severely silent, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
eng_Latn but it was unintelligible.
eng_Latn but had never used a telephone before.
eng_Latn might not even wish him to address him in any way.
eng_Latn that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion.
eng_Latn a fearful voyage I had with such a monster in the vessel.
eng_Latn There s enough bamboo here for all our friends and family!
eng_Latn but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and in forgiving.
eng_Latn I don't know how I could have slept through it.
eng_Latn so they nearly always win.
eng_Latn but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce.
eng_Latn The sea shell garden was the othermonkeys something special.
eng_Latn I was way behind because I started to read & write so late.
eng_Latn just to annoy her
eng_Latn that he had not yet received her note.
eng_Latn I gave my promise, and here
eng_Latn when I was nearly four that I suddenly realized that we owned a dog.
eng_Latn they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night
eng_Latn but in the morning he came to inquire
eng_Latn No? Hocus Pocus!
eng_Latn everybody one cares for is gone.
eng_Latn the room within the next few days
eng_Latn and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe
eng_Latn Amazing Grace!
eng_Latn not becausehe was one of the three
eng_Latn Aah. Any landing you can walk away from is a good one.
eng_Latn because people might deem him interested in her as a man.
eng_Latn were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation.
eng_Latn that one in my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be willing to surrender it.
eng_Latn for neither could row a boat or swim.
eng_Latn I will not forget this, mother, upon my word.
eng_Latn some poor creeter came a beggin', and your ma went straight off to see what was needed.
eng_Latn but one thing I beg of you, consider me your friend
eng_Latn he was tall and lean and muscular.
eng_Latn locked the gate behind us, and took out the key.
eng_Latn until the time came when neither man had the strength to move another inch.
eng_Latn tapped at his door, and softly called to him.
eng_Latn it is possible that their outlook might have been the same.
eng_Latn waited in silence for him to proceed.
eng_Latn which I did most cordially.
eng_Latn the flesh pads had disappeared
eng_Latn JeanValjean had a complete view of his back.
eng_Latn what could I expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me?
eng_Latn strange as it may appear to you.
eng_Latn Oh no. That s not a bit like Dog.
eng_Latn meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in sitting and shivering by the fire.
eng_Latn I thought it my part to obey.
eng_Latn a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door.
eng_Latn the clouds, now trooping before the wind, were filing off eastward in long, silvered columns.
eng_Latn twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns
eng_Latn he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room.
eng_Latn turning white at the mere suggestion.
eng_Latn she had allowed him to kiss her
eng_Latn turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at.
eng_Latn I don't take no offense 'cept a bust in the nose.
eng_Latn acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her ideas on one subject
eng_Latn This staircase goes into space!
eng_Latn I could sing my new song for you again? Of course Dog.
eng_Latn laid quietly side by side under one slab.
eng_Latn steals over me again
eng_Latn I didn't bother to swipe it away
eng_Latn we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.
eng_Latn she had not slept any more than he during the night.
eng_Latn doors that weren't really doors at all
eng_Latn we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.
eng_Latn I believe then that some faint idea of the truth began to force itself to his conscience
eng_Latn who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses
eng_Latn all of whom were wrapped in thick blankets.
eng_Latn but I feel sure I can pull him through.
eng_Latn Imagining pictures in the sky helped people find the stars they were looking for.
eng_Latn which is only another sort of benevolence.
eng_Latn till at last the whole company broke down
eng_Latn HELLO BOOKSHOP MICE!
eng_Latn there are a good many hours between this and to morrow
eng_Latn in a week I shall have left this country
eng_Latn but I shall lay my head on the pillow at night untroubled by evil thoughts.
eng_Latn as her temporary firmness forsook her
eng_Latn you can't think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shop where we could check it?
eng_Latn after wards something in the man heartening him, wishing that he hadnot.
eng_Latn by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation.
eng_Latn as though it were heavy.
eng_Latn it left me in darkness.
eng_Latn take care you don't get included among the ten victims!
eng_Latn while others live so apart from it
eng_Latn PUT PUG DOWN THOU MONSTER!!!
eng_Latn he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment.
eng_Latn it was the patient work of two years
eng_Latn that he might go out with him and question him as to his success.
eng_Latn where he lay still until they had summoned a patrol wagon to take him away.
eng_Latn for the universal entertainment of the people!
eng_Latn he could perceive something
eng_Latn for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor
eng_Latn but next moment he was master of himself.
eng_Latn asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded.
eng_Latn that one in my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be willing to surrender it.
eng_Latn I have only the supreme illusion of a lover.
eng_Latn power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.
eng_Latn so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
eng_Latn I can marry the person I want, I guess.
eng_Latn I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me!
eng_Latn there are a good many hours between this and to morrow
eng_Latn but because it would also set her at liberty.
eng_Latn but never anyone as famous as you're going to be.
eng_Latn only that mine were all of a colour.
eng_Latn he had never known a woman.
eng_Latn suddenly she knew very well what had frightened her
eng_Latn he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so much discomfort.
eng_Latn looking so earnestly at her father
eng_Latn in a flash of fear and horror I knew that he was right.
eng_Latn I left the owner of the horse to sit in the study all the evening with the lamp lighted.
eng_Latn after casting a hurried glance round the room
eng_Latn while it surprised her, it warmed her heart and pleased her very much.
eng_Latn finally, frightened by my assertions that I would tell papa
eng_Latn to cry for the things he had lost, that he had a right to be in shock if that was what this was.
eng_Latn ...Witch Willow.
eng_Latn who had already risen to take her leave, and went out.
eng_Latn I might meet your husband, and I should kill him on the spot.
eng_Latn the angels shall hold him up lest he fall and bruise himself
eng_Latn for that was the sort of thing he himself had dreamed of, two or three years ago.
eng_Latn but she laid her hand upon his arm.
eng_Latn I get off here at six.
eng_Latn It is good to see again old friend, and just in time to help me solve my most baffling mystery. Where did I put my hat?
eng_Latn she rushed out of the room.
eng_Latn who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling.
eng_Latn then got up and hurried away.
eng_Latn many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair.
eng_Latn the bit of money I'd put aside during the last year of war
eng_Latn it is that there is no one left to give us orders.
eng_Latn I lifted it to my nose to see if it was the same copy.
eng_Latn my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed
eng_Latn before a youth of obviously so much more training and schooling than he possessed
eng_Latn Pug, though it pains me to sayit... chase that cat!
eng_Latn spent the whole day dreaming on their feet.
eng_Latn I did very miserably deceive you
eng_Latn without the added vexation of prayers
eng_Latn you don't talk.
eng_Latn limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast.
eng_Latn none here are loyal to me
eng_Latn for by this time the three horses and the ass had smelt one another out, and were all together.
eng_Latn I voiced my curiosity impulsively, and then the words were out, and it was too late to recall them.
eng_Latn they were sure of themselves.
eng_Latn I just don't know.
eng_Latn you must look life in the face.
eng_Latn I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.
eng_Latn dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
eng_Latn he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries
eng_Latn but the fear of the future was strong upon him
eng_Latn I lowered my head instantly, and became very busy with the emptying of my own teacup, screening myself behind the cosy.
eng_Latn leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit.
eng_Latn I love you all, like children of my own, as you know.
eng_Latn I'm takin' up this here bearing now.
eng_Latn he had to keep swallowing
eng_Latn it was of a white damask which was fashionable in those days.
eng_Latn the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it.
eng_Latn I didn't do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind.
eng_Latn I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before.
eng_Latn she had worn during the first days of their married life
eng_Latn endless erratic shapes dropped and smeared from the door to the kitchen.
eng_Latn not the sort who could set up his own operation starting from scratch.
eng_Latn but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought, no will,
eng_Latn yes nothing more true
eng_Latn he was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.
eng_Latn who had slain him.
eng_Latn which signify malice or stupidity.
eng_Latn I was looking at your face just now.
eng_Latn but they had never been old enough together to know what shyness was.
eng_Latn he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire
eng_Latn he was humiliated by that three thousand on account of his own meanness!
eng_Latn as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without.
eng_Latn to make sure that he was unobserved
eng_Latn eating bread that I had bought for supper.
eng_Latn I was an exact _Yahoo_ in every part
eng_Latn but don't call him so, he will be offended.
eng_Latn it was the smell of gas.
eng_Latn I have had an idea, ever since you have been better, of simply planting her at your bedside
eng_Latn but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it.
eng_Latn delirious with his love half my time for he would
eng_Latn although he had learned nothing really satisfactory
eng_Latn as if the fabric of existence had been torn briskly in two.
eng_Latn a wolf standing in silent grief before me.
eng_Latn whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.
eng_Latn I felt that no words of condolence availed
eng_Latn throwing back her wraps, and showing a thin but well built figure.
eng_Latn there it remained
eng_Latn so we lived,' he said
eng_Latn I've got to get back to him.
eng_Latn I have all the evidence you need right here.
eng_Latn So were those burgers big or smallor huge or tiny Granny?
eng_Latn partly curiosity, perhaps, and partly as a kind of precaution.
eng_Latn unless he can afford one or two strong servants to attend him.
eng_Latn but here she grew impatient with this legal verbiage, and said
eng_Latn I took one last deep breath at the door of the classroom, and then held it in my lungs as I walked into the small, warm space.
eng_Latn I put them both outside my door last night
eng_Latn I do want it.
eng_Latn I grinned at her and touched my forehead.
eng_Latn but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it.
eng_Latn his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet.
eng_Latn my steward transacts all this business for me
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn I see everything through the eyes of the beast.
eng_Latn when I'm not having laurie.
eng_Latn ..I love funny books that really make me...
eng_Latn reminding me that summer was officially over.
eng_Latn then lay on their oars.
eng_Latn I regarded and accepted it as such.
eng_Latn his eyes closed.
eng_Latn was all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice
eng_Latn for she had kept him in charge after learning of his brutalities.
eng_Latn there must be no doubt of victory
eng_Latn but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.
eng_Latn I hope he didn't have an accident coming down that frigging mountain
eng_Latn a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long.
eng_Latn at last he was nearly as well placed here, socially, as any one.
eng_Latn he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all.
eng_Latn the girl won't know where she is
eng_Latn an impudent conductor slammed the door and the latch.
eng_Latn I'll bet he's got the trains running on time and all his ducks in a row.
eng_Latn with a plain elderly gentleman who has been playing whist all night
eng_Latn whose mouth was hanging open.
eng_Latn I care little who has placed us here below to fulfil our duties as citizens and fathers of families
eng_Latn told him that she was beginning to think he was the nicest ever
eng_Latn Unless I want to go swimming.
eng_Latn drop to the ground and straighten up
eng_Latn unattended by anyone except the carter on a mule, and a man sitting in front.
eng_Latn I looked at the photo she had handed me.
eng_Latn it was obvious that the wife broke off all relations with the husband and threw in her lot with the lover.
eng_Latn I seen forty two cars a you fellas go by yesterday.
eng_Latn except, perhaps, under my protection.
eng_Latn the air whistled down my throat, swirling the motes into a vortex.
eng_Latn grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful.
eng_Latn I know your father's turned idiot
eng_Latn she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.
eng_Latn then of course my family has also to be considered
eng_Latn drew her comfortably close and said nothing.
eng_Latn on his neck a chain with a small gold fish.
eng_Latn only I've known it a long while.
eng_Latn as well those that are the king's as those belonging to private individuals
eng_Latn to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour
eng_Latn yeh gotta have the best wand.
eng_Latn till we fell into a profound sleep
eng_Latn it got on his mind and turned his brain
eng_Latn I want those people hiding in holes by next spring.
eng_Latn beat down his guard a
eng_Latn I drew up my canoe as close as I could to the shore
eng_Latn I don't like to lie
eng_Latn if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship.
eng_Latn he knew that sooner or later he would step across it
eng_Latn I could get money enough together to come up there and talkto her some more and
eng_Latn nobody can doubt that.
eng_Latn he did not appear to be very ready with suggestions available ones.
eng_Latn walked out onto the field.
eng_Latn the rest will soon be far from here
eng_Latn a crumpled shako on the back of his head.
eng_Latn for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams
eng_Latn give me a bit more time.
eng_Latn ricocheted, struck something else, and whined off again.
eng_Latn he was deadly cold.
eng_Latn we can't be too careful as to how we move from now on.
eng_Latn she cried aloud in her despair.
eng_Latn The mice do like playing hide and squeak. And Dog? Dog Loves Books.
eng_Latn settled his affairs at home.
eng_Latn I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked of me
eng_Latn This whole room is one big book -and Dog loves Books!
eng_Latn the man, who had entered but a moment before me, and was still unpacking his parcels
eng_Latn that she was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation.
eng_Latn that he should pay her more attention than he had done before.
eng_Latn he was, spoke.
eng_Latn to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose
eng_Latn I want you to cover it.
eng_Latn she saw what a little creature I really was.
eng_Latn ...and Dog...and Pug.
eng_Latn however reluctantly and gloomily
eng_Latn without seeming to recollect where he was
eng_Latn he had boarded the night mail with two minutes to spare.
eng_Latn he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.
eng_Latn as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport.
eng_Latn yet after a few minutes the bird came back.
eng_Latn we arrived at my city
eng_Latn I don't think they's luck or bad luck.
eng_Latn this with greater dexterity than I could at first imagine.
eng_Latn as with one thinking deeply and intensely.
eng_Latn held her hand in his, guiding it
eng_Latn all gladness left him
eng_Latn running a hand down it until he caught just the ends of it between his fingers.
eng_Latn only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely
eng_Latn as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend.
eng_Latn I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.
eng_Latn We need to get them to help us!
eng_Latn not discerning the forms, but expecting the summons.
eng_Latn they were like schoolboys after a few hours in school.
eng_Latn when he laid his hand upon my arm.
eng_Latn ordered footmen to bring the others
eng_Latn Yargh!
eng_Latn Perhaps the solution is under your own nose too Dog...or rather your bottom!
eng_Latn I'd like to talk to the electrician who went out there the day before the fire.
eng_Latn Especially those who guided ships home safely from the sea. The end.
eng_Latn I could take you to the cleaners!
eng_Latn get laughed at.
eng_Latn I rub my face confusedly.
eng_Latn somebody was dead
eng_Latn I am Dog and this is Pug. But I don t think we are who you’re looking for.
eng_Latn Walk this way.
eng_Latn to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour
eng_Latn she began to recall what.
eng_Latn had grown so used to it
eng_Latn poor scrubby midshipman as I am.
eng_Latn of course he might say the thought came to him as an inspiration
eng_Latn I have to find out what he meant by that.
eng_Latn I never heard such delicious music.
eng_Latn That s settled then.
eng_Latn I could see that she was afraid, though.
eng_Latn he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished.
eng_Latn producing a queer sound which immediately broke off.
eng_Latn I don't know.
eng_Latn stopped at once, all.
eng_Latn I told you that it was all about practice.
eng_Latn almost her first resolution, to seek her for that purpose, in the pump room at noon.
eng_Latn the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful
eng_Latn to an observer therefore, perhaps barely there.
eng_Latn don't forget, madam, that we are dealing here with a little viper who put a stinkbomb under my desk
eng_Latn No. Can t hear a thing! Who are they?
eng_Latn if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him, and find him though he were to hide himself in the whale's belly.
eng_Latn he finally managed to say.
eng_Latn for anyone to walk in and be welcomed.
eng_Latn to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school
eng_Latn only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new, different aspect
eng_Latn that year had counted for thirty.
eng_Latn then he speeded up for a moment and listened.
eng_Latn saying, that the farmer had instructed me very well in my lesson
eng_Latn as I have done many a time before
eng_Latn I should ask that I might be permitted to come
eng_Latn but I got some batteries from the hardware store.
eng_Latn I'm LONGING to go back and begin work.
eng_Latn I must go out alone.
eng_Latn then folded them all up again carefully.
eng_Latn so these adventures were carried out.
eng_Latn on which they had stopped a horseman holding a large white envelope in his hand.
eng_Latn Wait Dogstar. Wait!
eng_Latn I think you should write them down for other people to read.
eng_Latn who had perfectly recovered from his accident
eng_Latn knocked over his lamp
eng_Latn gave him a long enumeration of all the indispensable things that had been got on credit.
eng_Latn I thought it best to go back.
eng_Latn I do this for personal reasons.
eng_Latn I should choose this if I might,
eng_Latn but she liked it so much that she took another of the same size
eng_Latn he was to be restrained untilordered retried or executed.
eng_Latn she shoved the pistol down into the upholstery
eng_Latn that, by way of thanks, the prioress
eng_Latn thou must not put a hand to thy sword in my defence
eng_Latn would so like to meet you.
eng_Latn this took him an hour to drink, and then he had another, and another
eng_Latn I need something to be the roof.
eng_Latn I I hope so, sir.
eng_Latn must wait for the unseen antagonist to return it to them.
eng_Latn ever came back to the parish again
eng_Latn said another, who would have dearly liked to take another pie
eng_Latn a breathless look from all towards the door.
eng_Latn under pain of incurring my fierce indignation.
eng_Latn I don't want to freak her out.
eng_Latn but he said he 'lowed to lay for that boy.
eng_Latn must be liked
eng_Latn it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman
eng_Latn which we had entered in the morning.
eng_Latn but it was not enough to place him.
eng_Latn I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.
eng_Latn I think the arm will make up for the sword.
eng_Latn but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.
eng_Latn haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.
eng_Latn to give her the tongue depressor he had used to examine her throat.
eng_Latn the landlord's wife, opening the little half door of the bar, and bending down
eng_Latn they're going to save us all.
eng_Latn it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs.
eng_Latn I examined the food in his lap.
eng_Latn the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours.
eng_Latn A circle...
eng_Latn without reflecting how often he had seen it before
eng_Latn but her husband wasn't with her, and he didn't come in by plane or ferry.
eng_Latn broke his bread with his left hand and drank his soup with his right.
eng_Latn he was more concerned about himself and his own partially explained defection than he was about her.
eng_Latn her daughter should be married there
eng_Latn to increase our terrors, till, to our relief
eng_Latn while he gazed at her wonderingabout the outcome of all this.
eng_Latn so he could not be as expert in distinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in that element.
eng_Latn I'll say that you're thoughtful and kind, and you're not exacting
eng_Latn three changes plus four pairs of socks and shorts.
eng_Latn he gave up thinking about it.
eng_Latn I wrenched myself erect in one quick move.
eng_Latn is a plan in military terms to mount the attack and carry it through.
eng_Latn said the man with the red handkerchief
eng_Latn ran at once to aid them.
eng_Latn I have had an idea, ever since you have been better, of simply planting her at your bedside
eng_Latn which he had so impatiently awaited and to which
eng_Latn or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer
eng_Latn addressed to the wife of the editor of the
eng_Latn without even removing his glasses
eng_Latn I pulled my wallet from my jeans pocket
eng_Latn I felt disgusted at the little wretch's composure
eng_Latn was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
eng_Latn I'd already catalogued this one.
eng_Latn I do not say
eng_Latn how slothful and timid in mind.
eng_Latn they trundled out of the yard
eng_Latn he was always there, ready to give her exactly what she needed
eng_Latn how much time they had left.
eng_Latn or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands!
eng_Latn because we've got to win today
eng_Latn I came down again.
eng_Latn but at last we were allowed to bury her.
eng_Latn tied her cravat
eng_Latn he was contented to take half the usual rate
eng_Latn I'll be safe
eng_Latn put GBP300 on one side for the air fare and expenses the following day
eng_Latn but I fear I am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt
eng_Latn now here it was being used against him.
eng_Latn I meet a bourgeois.
eng_Latn this led up to the trouble in which he presently found himself.
eng_Latn that is why people object to it.
eng_Latn but this impossibility only strengthens my argument.
eng_Latn while she tidied herself before seeing him.
eng_Latn I have told you he was not sympathetic to me
eng_Latn both of us jerked at the sound.
eng_Latn I just love making up stories.
eng_Latn thou will at once engage in this love struggle
eng_Latn his guitar case in one hand, his free thumb in his mouth.
eng_Latn I wadded the gray cord up in the palm of my hand.
eng_Latn rsula visited him in his bedroom.
eng_Latn Now they re micycles!
eng_Latn so, instead of winning him
eng_Latn if you eat it
eng_Latn I tried all day two days.
eng_Latn beaded round with gilt
eng_Latn it will seem to you that they are resting.
eng_Latn flung it at the castle
eng_Latn whether you might be able to fill.
eng_Latn we glared at it, all three
eng_Latn I have told you my wish
eng_Latn still entangled in the crowds of soldiers.
eng_Latn as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.
eng_Latn I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here.
eng_Latn I thought it was high time, now or never
eng_Latn he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant
eng_Latn might be known to none but himself
eng_Latn again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand.
eng_Latn she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw, of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers.
eng_Latn I just hope he doesn't try to fuck up what we're doing now
eng_Latn but then, hereditary rank is abolished
eng_Latn I hope it will cure him.
eng_Latn I am quite at your service.
eng_Latn but characteristic and useful
eng_Latn I'm not a top businesswoman at all.
eng_Latn even then the whipcord breeches weren't altogether out of my mind.
eng_Latn above all after the dishonor of her expulsion
eng_Latn It's arms wide.
eng_Latn I also am a prisoner of the healers.
eng_Latn I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant
eng_Latn if you're interested.
eng_Latn realizing that his dreams of a happy outing this day were fading into nothing.
eng_Latn that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past
eng_Latn for experience will tell thee what mine is.
eng_Latn but I didn't wait to hear any more.
eng_Latn he leaped from his bed
eng_Latn he is not disposed to give his personal attention to the object.
eng_Latn the family is extinct
eng_Latn cat like, with bare feet
eng_Latn your serpent has destroyed you!
eng_Latn I started, or rather was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one and twenty
eng_Latn I think it desirable for him to know nothing more than that he must not overwork himself
eng_Latn I felt a senseless stupid irritation come over me, and I did not know how to prevent myself from turning round and screaming to him to stop.
eng_Latn that was courage.
eng_Latn but he made haste to drive it away.
eng_Latn I do not think you have yet known the want of money.
eng_Latn she added quietly.
eng_Latn wearing a veil to conceal her face.
eng_Latn but granting it true that there is an express law that squires are to fight while their masters are fighting
eng_Latn he had only to reach out his hand to take his pen
eng_Latn That rock is not a rock!
eng_Latn however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency
eng_Latn for I durst not stay to see the issue of the adventure.
eng_Latn I was not to be assured immortal life.
eng_Latn he walked several miles to return a couple of pennies that he had overcharged a woman.
eng_Latn we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of his pocket.
eng_Latn but it's me that ends up arguing from feeling and her from the codes of morality.
eng_Latn who would hem him in from two sides.
eng_Latn This is nice Bookshop Mice.
eng_Latn a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation,
eng_Latn had received and read the then famous rescript of
eng_Latn demanding from him the confirmation of the doctor's words that inhaling iodine worked wonders.
eng_Latn I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.
eng_Latn I haven't seen it all afternoon.
eng_Latn they were seeking an example to confront him with.
eng_Latn even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night
eng_Latn she was beginning, when a footman came into the room with a letter.
eng_Latn When did you last see your socks Pug?
eng_Latn I'm Grace. Ithought you were Father - he s gone ashore because we ve almost run out of oil for this lamp ... but that was hours ago!
eng_Latn though it is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps
eng_Latn asked her how that trunk had come into our hands, and what there was in it.
eng_Latn they took the spade and the pick there.
eng_Latn you'll not encourage my son to further disobedience.
eng_Latn twenty five years too late.
eng_Latn suddenly, with a crunching noise
eng_Latn took the side of the workers.
eng_Latn plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road
eng_Latn I gave myself very good reasons
eng_Latn the chill of that sudden, hurt silence.
eng_Latn Welcome aboard the S.S. Wowbowzer.
eng_Latn I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles more, was too much for me.
eng_Latn afterwards she did not understand how it was that she did not do so.
eng_Latn every day I am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him.
eng_Latn then came a sudden heavy fall of rain that lasted for nearly four days
eng_Latn the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly with the ropes
eng_Latn I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman.
eng_Latn the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.
eng_Latn to contradict this statement
eng_Latn bought herself a complete outfit of such clothes as women then wore
eng_Latn I told you he was plain.
eng_Latn he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and fand him.
eng_Latn this put her at once into good humour.
eng_Latn he slid sideways on his rain drenched broom
eng_Latn then I gave a cry of exultation
eng_Latn I feeltoo upset and uncertain about everything
eng_Latn then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of his departure.
eng_Latn because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her.
eng_Latn you never told me what he did?
eng_Latn I was running before I was out of the house.
eng_Latn without going beyond the known ground.
eng_Latn don't look so silly, now!
eng_Latn whose wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to observe.
eng_Latn because he was a man apart.
eng_Latn suddenly changing his tone
eng_Latn he opened it immediately.
eng_Latn if readers would only take this advice.
eng_Latn an enigma which perhaps is no enigma except for those who seek some meaning in it.
eng_Latn I heard the people stirring around in the house now, and see a light.
eng_Latn the work that she and his father were connectedwith
eng_Latn Perhaps there s a place that s a little less crowded?
eng_Latn she was looking forward to higher initiation in ideas
eng_Latn because of our warm fire.
eng_Latn I noticed nothing about her except that she had a pleasant voice.
eng_Latn I wondered why he didnt bring you around here before.
eng_Latn but for one who has a timid conscience
eng_Latn I heard all kinds of things about the school and all belonging to it.
eng_Latn in case andhere he paused and rested on the phrase
eng_Latn Pug?
eng_Latn while the curate had probably no pretty little children whom she could like, irrespective of principle.
eng_Latn he repeated his threatenings
eng_Latn he caught up a loaf that was near him
eng_Latn strong enough to knock me down and drag me into the woods.
eng_Latn because I consider it wrong to interfere with nature in this way.
eng_Latn he blessed him with his kindly, ironical smile, and
eng_Latn so was saved from a watery doom.
eng_Latn this would cause inquiries
eng_Latn run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen knife, and cut the big chains.
eng_Latn bought herself a pair of espadrilles on the way to the train.
eng_Latn it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this moment
eng_Latn I recognised her,by her wearing the same garments she wore when thou didst point her out to me.
eng_Latn something clutched in his hand.
eng_Latn I got in on my side and started the car.
eng_Latn placed the bone again in the dish erect, as it stood before.
eng_Latn he left two to guard the gate
eng_Latn look at t' poor lad, he's fair choking!
eng_Latn the night about three hours spent
eng_Latn I know, I know.
eng_Latn that had to be ended before it was too late.
eng_Latn not becausehe was one of the three
eng_Latn he had managed to hit it on its fleshy, shell less underside.
eng_Latn slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little crimson covered book.
eng_Latn what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast
eng_Latn whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns
eng_Latn HATs a possibility.
eng_Latn I am afraid I have some bad news Granny Pug. These are our footprints!
eng_Latn for under serious circumstances you may be called before the tribunals in order to enlighten the minds of the magistrates
eng_Latn proposed that he should ride with him along the line.
eng_Latn all of them, cheap and new.
eng_Latn anyone beating him at anything
eng_Latn it's because he's a human being, and he is ill and poor.
eng_Latn there's time enough!
eng_Latn I patted her hand.
eng_Latn in case there was a glass of water somewhere
eng_Latn waiting for the answer.
eng_Latn but there was a grin of triumph on his face.
eng_Latn but it's good natured.
eng_Latn OW - tent pegs!
eng_Latn I wasn't back from the war.
eng_Latn written without his father's knowledge, and that letter persuaded him to return.
eng_Latn gave me out of the window her hand to kiss.
eng_Latn when the garden bell rang.
eng_Latn as he met it with his own, she glanced, I thought, at me.
eng_Latn but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips
eng_Latn I saw his face I could tell.
eng_Latn he had another outbreak of his nights as a solitary hunter
eng_Latn that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger
eng_Latn I should rather refer it to the devil.
eng_Latn married a poor clergyman
eng_Latn Bedtime Baboon and the Moon .
eng_Latn leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag
eng_Latn that after all she wasright and I was wrong that it wouldn't be right
eng_Latn is to find himself in his lifetime in print and in type
eng_Latn rode toward his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper.
eng_Latn Seriously?
eng_Latn covering the ground.
eng_Latn struck him blows.
eng_Latn for although my proper employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship
eng_Latn of which there may be more than two thousand
eng_Latn we're all wearing ours
eng_Latn twisted around to see if it was a dragon
eng_Latn I could not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.
eng_Latn for I thought it below me to cry out.
eng_Latn I'd expose one of his secrets.
eng_Latn I'm a bit stuck for a replacement at the moment.
eng_Latn after some search for a name which should not be out of harmony with her own
eng_Latn This is a book about a great detective who solved all kindsof mysteries, and it is called..
eng_Latn set her up in business' is the correct term, I believe.
eng_Latn I had not very much to say.
eng_Latn she felt that the opportunity was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening.
eng_Latn afterwards I cannot in decency fail attending the club.
eng_Latn he is very unfortunate
eng_Latn in which she told her that she was about to be married.
eng_Latn nor exposed either at the corners of the market places
eng_Latn evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way.
eng_Latn I shall escape, that was settled apart from you
eng_Latn I want him to go away
eng_Latn he was confident that he would make his peace with her.
eng_Latn his hat,which he had flung over the wall, had been found and picked up.
eng_Latn with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!
eng_Latn I am afraid I won t be able to reada book to you today Pug.
eng_Latn let's have a look.
eng_Latn he laughs at your committee because it's the old way and the old ways are his ways
eng_Latn neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast.
eng_Latn we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board
eng_Latn that you jurors must find the prisoner atthe bar guilty of the crime of which he stands indicted.
eng_Latn I knew she didn't love me as I loved her.
eng_Latn was out in the night
eng_Latn I am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.
eng_Latn should have no thought of a second marriage needs no apology to the public
eng_Latn expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces
eng_Latn housewives' dough nuts or oly cooks, when fresh.
eng_Latn I asked for volunteers to come back and find him.
eng_Latn he lived in the house next door to that of her parents
eng_Latn I've been waiting a couple of hours for just that.
eng_Latn drew her comfortably close and said nothing.
eng_Latn yet my gladness was not without admixture.
eng_Latn she discovered overlooked articles which could abide nowhere else
eng_Latn To look af-ter a dog it is best wefirst un-der-stand how a dog works
eng_Latn you can tell all about it at the court martial.
eng_Latn I will do all I can to arrange the match between them.
eng_Latn then darted into the house for help.
eng_Latn like a good brother, she answered demurely.
eng_Latn the house lay before us.
eng_Latn she drove to her daughter's early one morning so as to find her alone.
eng_Latn something so unexpected by all of us and so contrary to the general hope
eng_Latn declared his feeling and tried to persuade her to marry him.
eng_Latn while she toured all the way around him, taking her time and looking.
eng_Latn to squint at what he'd fallen over
eng_Latn then he uttered a high pitched whimper.
eng_Latn My apologies Pug. I moved.
eng_Latn made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock.
eng_Latn could not gallop up to the spot before the party in smock frocks
eng_Latn I'll bring it in.
eng_Latn of all the exquisite things he placed before us, he touched nothing
eng_Latn I most certainly can blame him!
eng_Latn he got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.
eng_Latn on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut, for a repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply the mill
eng_Latn I have advised him to do that.
eng_Latn where the smallest sparrow had fallen
eng_Latn that jugged me for a vagrant.
eng_Latn which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon.
eng_Latn so fiercely they all jumped.
eng_Latn for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.
eng_Latn or it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.
eng_Latn only a house porter and a peasant.
eng_Latn I met him on the road and asked.
eng_Latn he had felt a stirring of tenderness.
eng_Latn he's been off color for ages, he was wasting away.
eng_Latn the power I had.
eng_Latn I will not be interrupted because of that bastard.
eng_Latn tied it to the other side of his collar like reins over his neck
eng_Latn I think the home influence will be very good for her.
eng_Latn Dog, are the stars little holes in the night that mean we should take it back to the shop?
eng_Latn then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been
eng_Latn opening a double eye glass, which hewore attached to a broad black riband
eng_Latn repeated over and over.
eng_Latn with this he went out of the inn.
eng_Latn she had been most anxious that he should spend this last evening with her
eng_Latn or it may drive him to desperate measures at once.
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all..I love stories that are...
eng_Latn I was so softened and forgiving, going through the town
eng_Latn I had the money the day before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!
eng_Latn which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness.
eng_Latn I just took that because it was the only chance I saw of getting up to town.
eng_Latn its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death.
eng_Latn a lesson from time to time, that wouldn't after all be very ruinous.
eng_Latn I got home just after the others had left for school.
eng_Latn but the turmoil within him was too great.
eng_Latn simple earthly accessories put on sale without any fuss by peddlers of everyday reality.
eng_Latn as his father to change his opinion.
eng_Latn Umm How curious.
eng_Latn a few steps farther
eng_Latn Stunning, eh Pug? We re thousandsof leagues under the seaand you re just in time to help me write a new chapter for the next edition of my book.
eng_Latn in which suddenly something gives way beneath you
eng_Latn but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by
eng_Latn then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.
eng_Latn I was part of the reason.
eng_Latn a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.
eng_Latn A Baffling Case for Sherlock Holmes.
eng_Latn but deep inside me, there was a part that held completely still.
eng_Latn it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.
eng_Latn some sort of physical contact absolutely forbidden between any but a married couple.
eng_Latn although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly well.
eng_Latn that at the last moment at the factory a very troublesome report
eng_Latn I dare you to step over that
eng_Latn the corpse placed on it
eng_Latn if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.
eng_Latn the reasons why he had declined them.
eng_Latn dumplings for supper!
eng_Latn I haven't heard a word.
eng_Latn it didn't take too long for the car to become stuffy and hot
eng_Latn I was afraid he would notice that my hand was shaking.
eng_Latn Wait till ye gets a load of this!
eng_Latn I knew it came from behind the panels.
eng_Latn he begged for another week which was granted to hiM
eng_Latn I would have predicted a rock on your finger within six months.
eng_Latn for they had not yet the heart to look further back.
eng_Latn they turned into a dark room they were passing
eng_Latn Oh. It's very colourful. And there s lots of string. What is it exactly?
eng_Latn We brought you something much better Sire.
eng_Latn from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.
eng_Latn no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening
eng_Latn he was seeking a hole inwhich he might hide until
eng_Latn I am Dog and this is Pug, Sire!
eng_Latn I mean, I'd rather take my chances with the monsters.
eng_Latn we are good friends with him
eng_Latn for though the elder was attached to me
eng_Latn stopped under a large baobab tree.
eng_Latn as if she were about to play some abnormal tune on the piano.
eng_Latn he would put it off as long as possible.
eng_Latn the air was fresh and dewy.
eng_Latn I was glad to settle down into one of the chairs.
eng_Latn Don t worry Mrs Berlin, we ll catchhim.
eng_Latn however virtuous he may be.
eng_Latn he was forced to call to his master to wait for him.
eng_Latn I says, that's what you get for narking ME!
eng_Latn But others may love them!
eng_Latn put up her plait, sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path.
eng_Latn I've never moved so quickly in my life.
eng_Latn like a sudden entrance into something new and strange, whose splendour terrified him.
eng_Latn then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket
eng_Latn it was devoted by the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.
eng_Latn I had not discharged myself of any part of it.
eng_Latn it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.
eng_Latn was soon in that eager frame of mind his brother knew so well, which always, with him, followed a brilliant and eager conversation.
eng_Latn I am going to marry.
eng_Latn he'd wrecked something very big this time
eng_Latn I've never seen him actually talk to anyone for more than a word here or there.
eng_Latn but do not meddle with what you do not understand
eng_Latn I gave him a very short relation of my voyage
eng_Latn it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.
eng_Latn covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime flower water
eng_Latn but for his lack of respect for an old man who had not done anyone any harm.
eng_Latn it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were.
eng_Latn nothing as yet.
eng_Latn on both sides the grass was long and violently green.
eng_Latn but couldn't say much more
eng_Latn bowed his head towards her
eng_Latn I think we should have brought those doggy biscuits with us.
eng_Latn it is impossible for anyone to steal a painting from this museum.
eng_Latn I sat up and saw the battle over
eng_Latn I can see her Dog! There s a new shape in the sky.
eng_Latn I have to thank her for this sprain.
eng_Latn when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen's apartments.
eng_Latn a thing unlovely, wearing the aspect of vengeance and hate
eng_Latn I did humbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our valour, or our interest.
eng_Latn then the square cracked
eng_Latn dearer to me than any blood sister could ever be.
eng_Latn that I knocked him down
eng_Latn but fixing her name and address with care in his memory.
eng_Latn the table was covered with tea things
eng_Latn I have no taste for tattle
eng_Latn without strong affection and humanity of heart
eng_Latn she took his arm in a clinging, snuggling embrace and measured her stride to his.
eng_Latn when he showed him the chair so that he could sit down
eng_Latn I can survive on either.
eng_Latn but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent
eng_Latn that they should see each other across the theatre at night
eng_Latn I'm not nervous
eng_Latn has been scientifically tested and measured since the 1980s and,
eng_Latn for never, never will they be able to share between them!
eng_Latn then it gathered greater speed and disappeared.
eng_Latn I felt like a cad just saying the words.
eng_Latn I don't care.
eng_Latn but there the similitude ceases.
eng_Latn I don't know nothing but laundrying.
eng_Latn because he hadn't any aunt.
eng_Latn lie at my full length in the temple.
eng_Latn on peril of his life
eng_Latn above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room.
eng_Latn that was obvious
eng_Latn which was betrayed and, as people expressed it, drowned in blood.
eng_Latn it was six or seven feet in length, and not more than a foot in height.
eng_Latn the ditch a bed of mud.
eng_Latn a strange little voice said hello.
eng_Latn I-it doesn t look very homely Dog.
eng_Latn but she didn't want to show it.
eng_Latn but inside there was a harmony of beauty
eng_Latn see that beneath it there lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it.
eng_Latn I'm going to find a book with at least twenty seven more chases!
eng_Latn blocking her path, he brought his face close to hers.
eng_Latn You re the one I ve been looking for!
eng_Latn I'll scold papa for quarrelling with him.
eng_Latn was soon to tell us why
eng_Latn Granny Pug s Big Book Of Puzzles!
eng_Latn , the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves
eng_Latn yet after a few minutes the bird came back.
eng_Latn it is a powerful signal that they are making a play for one another.
eng_Latn resuming the letter.
eng_Latn but they did not get much satisfaction out of him.
eng_Latn let them meet at a certain house on the morrow and make a test.
eng_Latn We ve come to save you, Granny Pug!
eng_Latn they spoke of playing charades, but in my ignorance I did not understand the term.
eng_Latn see if he won't.
eng_Latn he saw only moonlight and shadows.
eng_Latn she began to recover physically.
eng_Latn or a human being of some new species or unearthly breed.
eng_Latn to feel on the creased pouch of her worn old face the kiss of pity.
eng_Latn take up our time an' then walk out!
eng_Latn I am very anxious that she should get it, without delay, and I shall stay till she does.
eng_Latn the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as possible
eng_Latn to have travelled some distance.
eng_Latn I'd had three vodkas
eng_Latn then we could hear the handle being turned the bolt rattling
eng_Latn he got out heavily and dragged himself to the customs
eng_Latn like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him.
eng_Latn for he had remarked with particular attention the manner in which it had been told
eng_Latn I don't care whether you have one child or twenty
eng_Latn as we have loaves let us not go looking for cakes
eng_Latn I can no more help talking about them
eng_Latn this demand that she should surrender herself up to him entirely
eng_Latn the abbe sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed
eng_Latn ...the hunter.
eng_Latn I may not repay him by doing him harm to day.
eng_Latn he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it.
eng_Latn I hope she caught no cold last night.
eng_Latn in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.
eng_Latn since the boy's illness she had always been anxious.
eng_Latn but he had not thought of hunger nor did he think of it now
eng_Latn I handed her the coffee we'd brought.
eng_Latn but nonetheless sleep crept over him.
eng_Latn in the peasants, nor in music
eng_Latn his eyes went quietly around the circle of faces.
eng_Latn I-I don t think I can do this.
eng_Latn if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?
eng_Latn the village was behind them.
eng_Latn that one must passer par dessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment.
eng_Latn raised it from seventhousand to eighty five hundred
eng_Latn to feel on the creased pouch of her worn old face the kiss of pity.
eng_Latn now it was we who lay uncovered
eng_Latn I'll do that for you.
eng_Latn a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one's rheumatic back.
eng_Latn between eighty five and ninety feet in length
eng_Latn she's simply forgotten my existence.
eng_Latn That s it! We can t play together.You re big, I'm small, we re just too different and it's never going to work out. Hmmph.
eng_Latn I mean compared with before the war,' I said.
eng_Latn I'd take real good care of you.
eng_Latn because they want the same endowments.
eng_Latn all we got to do is to stick to it
eng_Latn I know that it's awful quiet.
eng_Latn but presently recognised him as one of his father's servants
eng_Latn I dont care.
eng_Latn which was circled a number of divans and chairs.
eng_Latn there came a sudden loud screech from behind him
eng_Latn he hasn't once looked out.
eng_Latn I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars.
eng_Latn told how cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them.
eng_Latn not to stop till
eng_Latn I pull a face at her behind her back as she leaves, and start putting on my mascara
eng_Latn my mother liked her very much.
eng_Latn I haven't quite sorted out your stuff yet
eng_Latn I don't like your gown
eng_Latn for the first time in his life alittle condescendingly.
eng_Latn he wrote hastily in the porter's room, so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting place.
eng_Latn I'll have to look elsewhere for allies.
eng_Latn to enjoy his prostration.
eng_Latn I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject
eng_Latn if my husband applies to you for payment for board and lodging
eng_Latn I can't see him anywhere.
eng_Latn they sat a long time talking of their happiness.
eng_Latn I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart.
eng_Latn such as forcing locks or
eng_Latn who had slain him.
eng_Latn took his sister away into a secluded corner of the cricket pitch.
eng_Latn judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.
eng_Latn I don't know.
eng_Latn she hastened from the room.
eng_Latn I speak to you
eng_Latn let him know, I there waited his majesty's command.
eng_Latn they move on again.
eng_Latn these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from.
eng_Latn till this moment I've been afraid to ask you, you, even you.
eng_Latn distrust yourself as well as him.
eng_Latn a tiny little dicky bird told me you just might want it.
eng_Latn but I found out her husband's name, and I made a note of it.
eng_Latn others had gone to the front
eng_Latn for she who has once entrusted to you the defence of her person
eng_Latn it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation.
eng_Latn for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair.
eng_Latn that gave him the look of a man on his deathbed.
eng_Latn intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him.
eng_Latn Hello boys. I was just meditating on when I might see you again - and here you are!
eng_Latn so harshly that the child started up from the floor
eng_Latn I'm not nervous
eng_Latn you would make me weep, if such a thing were possible.
eng_Latn I would never do that.
eng_Latn he did not need to turn around to see her in his imagination.
eng_Latn he said you'd resigned.
eng_Latn I must meet him with a heart at ease, and that quiet conscience
eng_Latn now for the first time had the courage to look at him.
eng_Latn while the mob which, pouring out of the town, had spread itself all along the shore, howled and foamed at the foot of the building in front.
eng_Latn I won't disturb their happiness.
eng_Latn almost with gentleness.
eng_Latn I offered her the key.
eng_Latn I feigned a criminal process
eng_Latn turned the pages without reading it.
eng_Latn her brother volunteered
eng_Latn I will explain everything to you in amoment.
eng_Latn There s number one!
eng_Latn dismay too deep to be uttered in words even to her husband.
eng_Latn for the mystic music seemed so innocuous compared with the state of his soul
eng_Latn I told him that you had been sick, but you were fine now
eng_Latn I could never endure to look in a glass, after mine eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects
eng_Latn he seemed to sense it, and pulled his hand reluctantly away.
eng_Latn she thought, stooping down to look, a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours.
eng_Latn Uh... Pug?
eng_Latn lay down flat on his stomach and crawled alongon top of the wall as far as the cant.
eng_Latn Ferrets...Farmers..Ah..Fairy Tales!
eng_Latn as if my touch brought her to life.
eng_Latn I said 'fisher,' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings.
eng_Latn but she meant to live as she pleased.
eng_Latn when the fugitive husband was captured
eng_Latn which was laid on the ground on purpose for me
eng_Latn especially since he tried to hang himself.
eng_Latn that he had not thought of his father
eng_Latn I am too ill
eng_Latn only it's wasting time.
eng_Latn I wouldn't've been able to stand it.
eng_Latn in law, had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.
eng_Latn there it teetered for a few seconds before finally toppling over and falling with a sharp tinkle on to the desk top.
eng_Latn she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor.
eng_Latn hoped, in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.
eng_Latn but in order to show that he took her levity with the toad in good part
eng_Latn then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity
eng_Latn That must be the dog s brain!
eng_Latn I really do want a little more time being human.
eng_Latn while they too put the helm hard up to let us pass.
eng_Latn the sun was right behind him, and he wasn't wearing _ a hat.
eng_Latn I must show it you some day or other.
eng_Latn though it was a long shot for his small bow.
eng_Latn dressed as a joker with a red and yellow pointy hat.
eng_Latn that they should bear them company as far as his village, he paying them so much a day.
eng_Latn I'll learn you.
eng_Latn closed the door behind him.
eng_Latn no power on earth could have made her do anything to hurt them.
eng_Latn though they lay dying.
eng_Latn but I never liked him.
eng_Latn for I think it will be a good lesson, to put him to shame by catching him with the widow.
eng_Latn play compared to the horrors of school.
eng_Latn yet it was all he could do to help it.
eng_Latn Showing Pablo Piccadilly how tobecome the greatest accordion player in the world!
eng_Latn painfully to the end of his life.
eng_Latn before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice.
eng_Latn without looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner
eng_Latn the father and daughter departed in it.
eng_Latn for he was, I repeat, a boy, when his father ordered him to marry.
eng_Latn he had never known before
eng_Latn I shall expect you every day
eng_Latn he cut his friend's throat like a sheep, and took the watch.
eng_Latn I see by everything that it will often be repeated
eng_Latn a strange little voice said hello.
eng_Latn as the skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax
eng_Latn once more, though, she felt an electric response to his person
eng_Latn applying the glue just as her father was getting up from the breakfast table.
eng_Latn I must pursue general knowledge.
eng_Latn but very attractive, and an infant a few months old.
eng_Latn as well as marriage in the future.
eng_Latn I was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me silence.
eng_Latn conducted her around the premises before the guests arrived.
eng_Latn to that end it were well to begin with a little reading.
eng_Latn pushing a bowl of canned soup into the room.
eng_Latn killed and scalped each other by thousands.
eng_Latn because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued.
eng_Latn I felt my box raised very high in the air
eng_Latn met to enter upon a painful conversation
eng_Latn I've told you why I'm talking of them.
eng_Latn I could see that she was afraid, though.
eng_Latn did just that, divorced her.
eng_Latn he looked at his own naked body and shuddered
eng_Latn I don't quite remember how he described him.
eng_Latn I spared him from his mortification by answering his question.
eng_Latn dwell upon memories of the past.
eng_Latn I chuckled hopefully it was too quiet for her to hear.
eng_Latn Remarkable.
eng_Latn she was leaner and more graceful, her proportions were more even, like an adult's.
eng_Latn involved once more in the patient manipulation of the material
eng_Latn had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard.
eng_Latn but they could not get to sleep
eng_Latn ...tale...narrative...yarn...
eng_Latn but for some reason she found herself instinctively walking past that particular shelf.
eng_Latn but I was not by any means certain that the fellow would have let you go.
eng_Latn than in keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it.
eng_Latn they shook hands again.
eng_Latn it's pretty important.
eng_Latn I don't want anybody else's leavings.
eng_Latn wary, every sense alert.
eng_Latn I have a steady hand and a strong arm
eng_Latn you must stop dat dam racket!
eng_Latn whither my master went as the representative of our district.
eng_Latn but share her husband's efforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible.
eng_Latn but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raise the country and that the mounted coast guard would come at once to see what was the matter
eng_Latn but I leave work half an hour early.
eng_Latn I only popped to the shop Pug.
eng_Latn as she had been enjoying for the last six months.
eng_Latn possibly a fox.
eng_Latn which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly do.
eng_Latn but what they grow to be!
eng_Latn I ask only the right to love now, and next minute, if needs must, to be out of love.
eng_Latn to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you.
eng_Latn Wow Bowser! It's the Lesser SpottedKraken! And it's using the rock as a disguise! It's called camouflage!
eng_Latn I struggled to calm myself without the deep breath this time.
eng_Latn To the wheelie-ladder, Dog?
eng_Latn the only one by which he could descend
eng_Latn the carpenter here can arrange it easily.
eng_Latn now you owe me five.
eng_Latn he would move the captains to take some pity on us.
eng_Latn my mother and sister.
eng_Latn was watching this performance over the rim of her book with some interest.
eng_Latn I won't go without finding out.
eng_Latn there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
eng_Latn she still has her wreath.
eng_Latn Hello looky snail.
eng_Latn so that the insider commanded a complete view forward.
eng_Latn if their appetite too, so much the better!
eng_Latn he said, and he let go my hand because we had reached a bend in the road.
eng_Latn there was an aged goat lying against the open back kitchen door.
eng_Latn when she had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me
eng_Latn everybody got bills at the grocery.
eng_Latn I considered another interesting phenomenon
eng_Latn then the square cracked
eng_Latn I've got no chance with these on
eng_Latn FYI, it's going to be sunny on both sides of the sound this weekend.
eng_Latn it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion.
eng_Latn disappeared with the rest into the wood.
eng_Latn Ah Yaaaay!
eng_Latn was appalled at what he had done.
eng_Latn I suppose he would be about sixty five
eng_Latn but he left, shutting the door with a snap.
eng_Latn cried my mother in another burst of distress, and breaking down again.
eng_Latn I have neither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate.
eng_Latn that is, present in the king's mind, but not uttered
eng_Latn the air was full of the impatient sound of idling engines.
eng_Latn as though thunderstruck.
eng_Latn it was again opened for the count.
eng_Latn like a bomb that might go off at any moment
eng_Latn whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience.
eng_Latn that card and this sealed paper
eng_Latn Yes, a Snark. We’re hunting one.
eng_Latn more especially when they are things which we are not forced or compelled to attempt
eng_Latn in all 62 guns.
eng_Latn that wouldn't do he wanted it with him where he could look at it
eng_Latn the situation of one, and the language of the other, so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty,
eng_Latn to begin the morning's work.
eng_Latn the parlor itself was asalon with a polished wood floor
eng_Latn he returned, and burst into a roar of laughter that shook the chaise.
eng_Latn leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
eng_Latn fathers and husbands had gone tramping.
eng_Latn for I was sure
eng_Latn if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.
eng_Latn I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant
eng_Latn I must speak freely to her
eng_Latn OK then.. Close your eyes.
eng_Latn I love my books to be dust free and spotless.
eng_Latn I thought he meant for missis's sickness, so I answered, yes.
eng_Latn I tried to remember to be gentle with him, but it was hard work to remember anything in the onslaught of sensation, hard to hold on to any coherent thoughts.
eng_Latn I wish to warn him, that he may be on his guard.
eng_Latn but was forced to move with extreme difficulty.
eng_Latn I have already told you answered the abbe that I loathe the idea of shedding blood
eng_Latn but unable to lift her back, she quivered all over and again fell on her side.
eng_Latn seized hiscold chisel and his hammer, and pried up the coffin lid.
eng_Latn proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.
eng_Latn that you shall not even care to sympathize with me.
eng_Latn meaning to imply a demand for a decisive answer.
eng_Latn I have a further thought.
eng_Latn he must promise before they left.
eng_Latn he took from his pocket a handkerchief andbegan to wipe his moist, cold face and hands.
eng_Latn when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said
eng_Latn but it is rather a good thing that he has arrived just at this moment.
eng_Latn frightful old world.
eng_Latn almost crumpling beneath the weight of a disapproval she had never known before.
eng_Latn a male human being without any physical significance for me.
eng_Latn sawed through a piece of meat until it was free of the wire.
eng_Latn an eager and curious spectator,
eng_Latn for the same cause and force that drove me to make you mine
eng_Latn the boy had been one of his students last year.
eng_Latn I passed the barber's shop.
eng_Latn I walked to the window, across the room
eng_Latn I can see a number three!
eng_Latn they held their breath till he was gone.
eng_Latn consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary
eng_Latn indeed, I was glad not to have been a spectator of the havoc they made
eng_Latn with the enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost.
eng_Latn his magical eye swiveled onto the window.
eng_Latn we wish to overturn
eng_Latn only smoke and blackened ruins remained.
eng_Latn we haven't seen him since the first task.
eng_Latn without even attempting to contend with it?
eng_Latn then spiralized downwards, and went eddying again round his head.
eng_Latn considerate than the welcome of the others.
eng_Latn to set off the dignity of the prince, and for the greater glory of the king's majesty.
eng_Latn I hain't ever done you no harm.
eng_Latn which was also not involved.
eng_Latn as a man I found a pleasure in her
eng_Latn he fell asleep with every appearance of excessive weariness.
eng_Latn I leaned back against the wall and then slid to the ground.
eng_Latn under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear
eng_Latn I wish I had not taken that.
eng_Latn she hurled them full in my face.
eng_Latn so that you will not collect for this squandering in the other life.
eng_Latn he lost his enthusiasm for the idea.
eng_Latn the real express sent after him
eng_Latn for that is the name of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery
eng_Latn my heart galloped toward its last beat.
eng_Latn Another dollop of yellow I think.
eng_Latn or he would have been a thief, long ago
eng_Latn he flung it off, and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.
eng_Latn filled it half with hot water and half with cold.
eng_Latn And also fogged the mind of my great friend Sherlock Holmes.
eng_Latn that she could not refuse him
eng_Latn Those naughty meadow birds have pecked the picnic.
eng_Latn to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence.
eng_Latn I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off.
eng_Latn I venture to say there are ten women to every man.
eng_Latn otherwise they are exactly as written
eng_Latn shows himself most plainly when you have need of him.
eng_Latn I went over to tell her a little about the meeting last night
eng_Latn I was going to be sick.
eng_Latn so how can I hope for divine forgiveness?
eng_Latn was folded one over another.
eng_Latn I am less unfit to teach in a school than in a family.
eng_Latn Dog. Dog. I ve invented a new kind of hat with my construction set!
eng_Latn but they were not to be admitted to him.
eng_Latn on his own part to provide him with the means of making his appearance in his own country
eng_Latn this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.
eng_Latn but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!
eng_Latn thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much
eng_Latn but the space was longer and narrower
eng_Latn you running away with the idea that
eng_Latn I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation
eng_Latn he would put it off as long as possible.
eng_Latn I have a business charge to acquit myself of.
eng_Latn so found the cage empty and the bird escaped.
eng_Latn but they can't bury it completely.
eng_Latn I'm able to curl up in my office, a harmless wolf, and wait for the moon to wane again.
eng_Latn And so Don Quixote and Sancho Panza rode off in search of more adventures
eng_Latn I hadn't an idea until about a couple of hours ago that they were going to have this meeting.
eng_Latn I am the Great Splendina No, I'm not the Great Splendina anymore.
eng_Latn it was only today for the first time that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone.
eng_Latn I bowed down to all the suffering of humanity,
eng_Latn I ll save you Dog and Pug!
eng_Latn which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders.
eng_Latn but she had never particularly remarked it
eng_Latn you don't talk.
eng_Latn unless by that clue there's in it, one may draw out the ball of the whole matter.
eng_Latn told the man what had happened
eng_Latn on his last visit this had struck him
eng_Latn Dog... is it me, or is the room spinning round?
eng_Latn which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last disburdened myself.
eng_Latn at least a dozen demons to each of us.
eng_Latn it is not a little matter that puts me out of temper.
eng_Latn if, indeed, such salvation be possible
eng_Latn I take the key from her and look at it in fascination
eng_Latn I thought I'd come and see how you were after last night.
eng_Latn a thread of strong sunshine cut it perpendicularly.
eng_Latn looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again
eng_Latn inother words, the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the manof felicity.
eng_Latn I made up my mind then I'd teach you a lesson, and him too.
eng_Latn it left me in darkness.
eng_Latn but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation
eng_Latn it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.
eng_Latn where they were to sit knitting, knitting
eng_Latn but is very generous to one quite impertinent girl
eng_Latn made her way through the throng of men by the door
eng_Latn he has seen after my simple wants
eng_Latn but I hold him in a reverential respect.
eng_Latn I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point
eng_Latn nobody could be!
eng_Latn like I remembered seeing the nurse do before our rabies shots.
eng_Latn he has closed his eyes to hear it better.
eng_Latn but she was careful about any gesture that might seem to betray her grief.
eng_Latn Leave it to me Dog!
eng_Latn I ain't got a big enough place for that.
eng_Latn I wonder if it's worth while being a second rate painter.
eng_Latn like I'd been crying or something.
eng_Latn where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in my life
eng_Latn I'll not risk my heart a third time.
eng_Latn he has given me the preference
eng_Latn I'd had enough fighting to last me for a while.
eng_Latn he looked anxiously toward his mother for confirmation.
eng_Latn I lost my first when I saw a bull gore one of our darkies and
eng_Latn where they might decently submerge themselves until themisery
eng_Latn I hoped she did.
eng_Latn flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse.
eng_Latn but was really obliged to put an end to it
eng_Latn Our world is divided into twoworlds.
eng_Latn that they would attract more people, and get more credit,
eng_Latn Pug, what are you doing today?
eng_Latn I'm not scared anymore!
eng_Latn I refused staunchly.
eng_Latn for both were idly smiling.
eng_Latn I had a quarrel with him during the siege
eng_Latn at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance.
eng_Latn I'm very glad, anyway, that I persuaded him,' she said
eng_Latn you are quide sure of being well receifed.
eng_Latn something terribleabout one of our own members.
eng_Latn everybody was asleep.
eng_Latn Pyramus is a sweet man.
eng_Latn it took place on that day, on the day of the three temptations.
eng_Latn but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the sofa, and opened his eyes.
eng_Latn made out of a broken backed chair cut down
eng_Latn so they nearly always win.
eng_Latn I've not been simply waiting, but thirsting for you the whole morning.
eng_Latn one day, when she felt better, he tried to take her, leaning on his arm, for a walk round the garden.
eng_Latn I have this unhappy book still!
eng_Latn I'll take it to them, and see what's going on.
eng_Latn at half past twelve o'clock, after he had wasted the night at the meeting and on the street.
eng_Latn but on the 13th we made up for it
eng_Latn but perhaps the man who had just gone away.
eng_Latn when he met me, he knew I was no dog.
eng_Latn I don't know.
eng_Latn but no doubt she had not heard him or had not grasped what he was saying.
eng_Latn that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever.
eng_Latn when,half distracted,he had rushed to the count's house
eng_Latn I'd shoot 'em for dog feed first.
eng_Latn I went into the flower room and washed my hands in the basin to save going upstairs.
eng_Latn a few old gnarled rose
eng_Latn he had succeeded after a hard struggle in throwing off his sorrow like an empty shell.
eng_Latn in a most respectful manner drank to her ladyship's health.
eng_Latn I was surprised when she complied immediately and without objection.
eng_Latn her head turned to watch him walk to the bed
eng_Latn well, you came crawling on your knees to me
eng_Latn ostracized as a chicken thief.
eng_Latn the searing, destroying power of such a thought as that
eng_Latn Hmm How curious. I wonder what they want?
eng_Latn This is rather exciting Pug.
eng_Latn but I think I should rather have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept in cages.
eng_Latn so justly complained of in all ages.
eng_Latn the number was printed on his identification card.
eng_Latn A mission?!
eng_Latn the small glow of another fire.
eng_Latn I never thought I'd meet a third year class who wouldn't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one.
eng_Latn ah, but it had come so sudden, and she hadn't been ready for it!
eng_Latn no servant will be offered you.
eng_Latn We re preparing to perform a play called Of Mice And Men. I am men.
eng_Latn coming to meet one another again, until they arranged by way of countersign, so as to know that it was they and not the ass, to give two brays, one after the other.
eng_Latn pushed her eyeglasses up onto her forehead, a
eng_Latn Perhaps we could help you look?
eng_Latn his adversary seized him by the hair
eng_Latn kissed each of the two large tears.
eng_Latn of the end of the month
eng_Latn on that you told me I was lying, that I was not an honorable man.
eng_Latn take and keep this ring in remembrance of me.
eng_Latn the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay
eng_Latn hearted child and rose up in the morning a woman with her mind made up.
eng_Latn clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.
eng_Latn gesturing him to the ground.
eng_Latn I took a deep breath, pulling in her scent.
eng_Latn on falling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground
eng_Latn I wondered if the bishop's wife saw the flush on my face
eng_Latn Oh Yes Books do make me feel better.
eng_Latn I sat down in my seat in the front.
eng_Latn I'm fat, but I'm strong and healthy.
eng_Latn that he had means
eng_Latn except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
eng_Latn I wish I could see them a lot less closer!
eng_Latn I saw you with someone last night.
eng_Latn found that only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate.
eng_Latn obliged to get my coals by stratagem
eng_Latn he is very unfortunate
eng_Latn edged her chair away from him.
eng_Latn he was about to begin to groan, as a starter,
eng_Latn it seemed a gay little chime after the great bell.
eng_Latn to realize that he had signed his name with his last breath.
eng_Latn until her little daughter was six years old.
eng_Latn went up to the pier glass to see whether she really had done her hair.
eng_Latn every one of them worth an eye of one's head!
eng_Latn not a ruffle disarranged, supporting her small, thickset father.
eng_Latn that means fighting against and having victory over the false deity of the soul.
eng_Latn but the shining spectre of the treasure rose before him
eng_Latn And they ve been eaten by amonster?
eng_Latn so that she could sit down on the end of bed
eng_Latn they're going to buy me a new wand for next year.
eng_Latn some with prayers, and others with tears
eng_Latn seeing as I know what I owes you.
eng_Latn I was beginning to think wed have to send for a fresh pot.
eng_Latn so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
eng_Latn or until she is out of this thing, but thatit can't be helped.
eng_Latn her father had mentioned the telegram
eng_Latn by it I must travel in spite of all the world
eng_Latn screamed again, came down on his right leg once more
eng_Latn I didn't have to look at the screen to know who was calling.
eng_Latn not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears.
eng_Latn he has been a thorough paced little villain, all his life.' 'I never will believe it, sir
eng_Latn I just want to have sex!
eng_Latn to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued.
eng_Latn I wanted to buy a red rose for my mother.
eng_Latn I have nothing particular to tell the court.
eng_Latn I whipped the drawer open, and grabbed ' his.
eng_Latn to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases.
eng_Latn yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.
eng_Latn you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.
eng_Latn religion and agriculture more.
eng_Latn reflection came in as black and confused a flow.
eng_Latn the best way to make sure I am is to have a decent holiday.
eng_Latn yes nothing more true
eng_Latn she was told that she would die without pain, fear, or bitterness at dusk on the day that she finished it.
eng_Latn I passed through, and I came out again alive!
eng_Latn as an equal
eng_Latn I walked to the bathroom to check for myself.
eng_Latn which is only another sort of benevolence.
eng_Latn after as you say you accidentally struck her
eng_Latn I saw hope revive and felt regeneration possible.
eng_Latn he was puzzled as to just what attitude to assume in a situation where obviously something was wrong.
eng_Latn whether you care much and how soon you cease to care
eng_Latn the spurs were not gilt, but lacquered green
eng_Latn I like having you around.
eng_Latn now I have seen you and know you are well and have all you require
eng_Latn this unexpected will need not personally wound you
eng_Latn but was certain that it would be repeated at any moment.
eng_Latn MMorrel did not wait for a second invitation
eng_Latn if haply its author was some sage who is an enemy of mine
eng_Latn we are good friends with him
eng_Latn fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
eng_Latn without taking care of me, number one.
eng_Latn I held my hand out to him, and he took it.
eng_Latn she felt her hands being painfully pressed.
eng_Latn I figured I'd poke my head in, see what was going on, give 'em the green light to go hunting
eng_Latn I'm going to be unladylike.
eng_Latn spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such civilities from a Yahoo.
eng_Latn as we said
eng_Latn as active a creature about everything but his own affairs as ever existed
eng_Latn took a silver key from his pocket
eng_Latn the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip
eng_Latn read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.
eng_Latn Is THIS the kind of place you d like have a holiday?
eng_Latn I have a strong intention of defending my person
eng_Latn had passed now into personal devotion, and tender thought of her lot.
eng_Latn however, but quite another feeling akin to terror had overtaken him.
eng_Latn sidling, through the two principal streets
eng_Latn ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave
eng_Latn but it was unintelligible.
eng_Latn I love books I can sit back and read for a really long...
eng_Latn the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of aninhabitant of the faubourg
eng_Latn I thought he was just, you know, making conversation.
eng_Latn but as soon as he came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high
eng_Latn then you thought of another plan and hoodwinked them once again.
eng_Latn the sun is one of them.
eng_Latn simply by lighting the way for her unselfishness and sympathy.
eng_Latn I'll help ya if ya want,
eng_Latn took with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.
eng_Latn the ceremony had lasted exactly the right amount of time, allowing the sun to set behind the trees.
eng_Latn for there was not one man aboard to mend another.
eng_Latn with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with.
eng_Latn I don't like to lie
eng_Latn I had a mind to speak to him about it
eng_Latn I don't see why you should.
eng_Latn she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure.
eng_Latn to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all without distinction.
eng_Latn I thought I'd just quickly make something up.
eng_Latn if you don't take care.
eng_Latn so it must be a free show again.
eng_Latn you might put a monkey for a margrave, and vice versa
eng_Latn gave him a good blow with the flat side of it
eng_Latn I went looking for you at the bookstore I saw in her head.
eng_Latn that's so dreadful!
eng_Latn lest you should take it into that head of yours
eng_Latn Hmm Mountaineering ... Sheep Shearing. Ahh.. Engineering!
eng_Latn they'll be ready for repotting again
eng_Latn propping her sticks against a bamboo table while the priest sat opposite her with the folds of his soutane falling about him
eng_Latn which are no longer the conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor
eng_Latn but she began again the instant he left the room
eng_Latn to sea again in their shirts.
eng_Latn where he lay at full length until his laugh was over
eng_Latn he was all the more confirmed in this notion
eng_Latn in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart.
eng_Latn I have great pleasure in congratulating you.
eng_Latn because it was not fastened.
eng_Latn I broke with him last night, and am very sorry that I did not do so before.
eng_Latn every notary bears within him the debris of a poet.
eng_Latn who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored
eng_Latn Ah. Hurry back Dog. We don t want these yummy chocolate eclairs to go past their eat by date.
eng_Latn to give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.
eng_Latn if he has not money enough to keep up the property
eng_Latn but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit
eng_Latn but when she came and he realised that he had gone out of her thoughts entirely
eng_Latn I don't like him, she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.
eng_Latn as if all the fertility and amorous activity of a summer's evening were woven web like about his body.
eng_Latn you could never see it.
eng_Latn as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife's room
eng_Latn he carries away the body of my child!
eng_Latn as for all this about your parents
eng_Latn the maiden was placed in an upper chamber
eng_Latn was inclined to think of them certain girls in particular
eng_Latn Oh no you re not.
eng_Latn I'll help ya if ya want,
eng_Latn once a man who had been stabbed, ejected from a moving car with a knife in his back.
eng_Latn the monster in my head agreed.
eng_Latn he he insulted me.
eng_Latn finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet
eng_Latn no one had ever understood you properly
eng_Latn that to compass his ends
eng_Latn he's a state organizer of our party, and one of our best known speakers!
eng_Latn I know, I know.
eng_Latn that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business
eng_Latn even if they can do nothing to him in the end
eng_Latn one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen
eng_Latn I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion
eng_Latn I have another ground of action
eng_Latn Umm Perhaps you can.
eng_Latn always in secret
eng_Latn until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet
eng_Latn I wish for no virtues of that kind.
eng_Latn much distressed and evidently fatigued.
eng_Latn but it didn't say anything about your cousins being over there.
eng_Latn but the blood had stopped forever.
eng_Latn I feel them, and act them.
eng_Latn it was necessary to keep an eye on her so that she would not paint little animals on the walls with a stick daubed in her own excrement.
eng_Latn on condition that he never attempted to see your mother.
eng_Latn but he insisted on speaking to her.
eng_Latn or man's countenance is no longer to be relied on.
eng_Latn I don't think I ever remember her serving a customer.
eng_Latn I may find pearls.
eng_Latn so that she boasted of being the grandmother with the best bed in the city.
eng_Latn as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else
eng_Latn yet lowering his voice in order to give the dreadful subject its proper medium of obscurity
eng_Latn I chiefly wanted to know, to what cause, in art or in nature, it owed its several motions
eng_Latn I hoped heartily we should have peace now.
eng_Latn besides, there is good reason to show that it now wants but little of day.
eng_Latn from that point on he was going to lose control
eng_Latn till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing.
eng_Latn I know the Professor was mean. But he didn t really mean it. He was just being a people. And people can get a bit carried away by something new.
eng_Latn I had the honour of being passed on the road.
eng_Latn he may have upset the case altogether.
eng_Latn I've had enough of it
eng_Latn to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters.
eng_Latn afterwards I cannot in decency fail attending the club.
eng_Latn which we intended to take up our position and begin the action
eng_Latn apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed.
eng_Latn he repeated his threatenings
eng_Latn she went to bed at last with nothing settled
eng_Latn she broke the hinges and divided the case
eng_Latn if you're through with the phone, honey, I'd like to call my lawyer.
eng_Latn was unable to dissuade him.
eng_Latn didn't talk to each other for the whole class.
eng_Latn we stayed to see it covered.
eng_Latn that resembled a half plucked turkey.
eng_Latn for all your smothering yourself under that hot lap robe.
eng_Latn seven hundred roubles down, and the remaining two thousand three hundred to be paid next day in the town.
eng_Latn not having done up her hair or finished dressing and with her old nurse's big shawl wrapped round her.
eng_Latn I need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside.
eng_Latn the lady made me feel it.
eng_Latn but a wife should bring her share and a husband his.
eng_Latn the bearing of his deeds a matter of private vision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the divine purposes.
eng_Latn had one child, this fellow
eng_Latn but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness.
eng_Latn Welcome to the wonderful world...
eng_Latn every day, for two or three hours
eng_Latn I must have taken cold in that nasty damp ride.
eng_Latn I was in the midst of the astonished family
eng_Latn looking nervously about him for hidden trap doors.
eng_Latn I come direct.
eng_Latn which I think you tend to forget.
eng_Latn I dug my nails into the loam and shot myself forward.
eng_Latn That s quite alright, Pug. In factyou ve just given me a most excellent idea.
eng_Latn but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture.
eng_Latn but a loose line was attached to his bridle
eng_Latn he gathered that from her spendthrift habits.
eng_Latn he felt himself at home in a quiet haven.
eng_Latn but the servants are not allowed above half that time
eng_Latn Oh dear. Where can they be?
eng_Latn for I too know what it is to have dreams.
eng_Latn but now I have no time.
eng_Latn I take one last look at myself in the mirror
eng_Latn but then he doesn't care about my fishing tackle.
eng_Latn she could even make a passably good periwig
eng_Latn dark haired, lanky, bent over a book
eng_Latn I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them.
eng_Latn I don't remember now, but I must have stood pale, facing him.
eng_Latn not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal
eng_Latn was master of the workhouse.
eng_Latn tiny and vulnerable.
eng_Latn his nationality would also be given in the answer.
eng_Latn I was looking for a job
eng_Latn with never a word to say for herself, like a woman should be.
eng_Latn when the sailors began chanting
eng_Latn then all cast down their eyes and sat silent.
eng_Latn felt the air behind him.
eng_Latn I could not think what it might be.
eng_Latn that was obvious
eng_Latn I know Dog. But it makes abrilliant funny noise.
eng_Latn glanced back through the pages, and again started his pencil.
eng_Latn I had to run to keep pace with him, catching at my breath, tears very near the surface
eng_Latn or did she lock up within her some secret
eng_Latn this, too, I resolved to state in my letter.
eng_Latn when she discovered that the fire was out.
eng_Latn one so big that your less fortunate friends can comfort themselves by whispering that it's really vulgar to wear such large stones.
eng_Latn was reluctant to give her the large dirty backed ledger.
eng_Latn though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is admirably correct and life like in its general effect.
eng_Latn accident or whatever it was that caused your lameness.
eng_Latn I stood on the balcony and breathed in the cool summer air.
eng_Latn nearly four months lying in her hut, raving like a mad thing at intervals
eng_Latn It's seaweed!
eng_Latn rsula took care of her as if she were her own daughter.
eng_Latn the day had grown dark very suddenly, and now there was thick thunder and the sound of rain had swelled.
eng_Latn he asked me to go and see him.
eng_Latn I got a book, and pretended to read.
eng_Latn still lingered about the same spot.
eng_Latn making a cavalier' s flourish with his top hat
eng_Latn wished she hadn't carried it so far.
eng_Latn That is what people come here tofind out. Let's read on.
eng_Latn as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents.
eng_Latn the one who had the power to release it
eng_Latn Is that you Dog?
eng_Latn ...of Magic!
eng_Latn the girl ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left
eng_Latn now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home
eng_Latn then it were far better to die rather than to sink from greatness.
eng_Latn I walked down street a ways and stopped.
eng_Latn I held my hand out to him, and he took it.
eng_Latn he saw through the window an older woman and a young girl sitting very close together on two chairs
eng_Latn or that the fraction of three witty sayings lasted eighteen thousand two hundred and fifty nights
eng_Latn I've heard about that too, it's dangerous.
eng_Latn I needed was some food and a little rest.
eng_Latn pungent scent of newly threshed wheat and a chaffy dust enveloped the village.
eng_Latn Just dogs... and a puppy!
eng_Latn you shall not have to answer for me.
eng_Latn but flew to him with open arms.
eng_Latn that's so dreadful!
eng_Latn I should prefer something hot today.
eng_Latn driven north eastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and longitude of 143.
eng_Latn the circumstances were not.
eng_Latn represents himself to his employers under a false name.
eng_Latn he observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tall in stature.
eng_Latn whose freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor.
eng_Latn Thank you... but no. I know I'm not very good at balancing, but if I don t keep trying I never will be any good. (HE GULPS) Aaah
eng_Latn I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself
eng_Latn I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.
eng_Latn when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household
eng_Latn I might say that we have paid for freedom.
eng_Latn had chosen it from the others for his place of residence.
eng_Latn thanking him in pothouse phrase for his civility they left him
eng_Latn but she never saw him alone.
eng_Latn beg her, almost formally, to deliver the message to her father.
eng_Latn I declined accepting more than was my due.
eng_Latn she paused in semi mock modesty as did the others.
eng_Latn work my own way
eng_Latn I started to my feet when I heard the name.
eng_Latn from that point on he was going to lose control
eng_Latn for she was incapable of ever loving anyone else in this world
eng_Latn although he seldom had leisure for paying her a visit
eng_Latn shotgun in his hands.
eng_Latn I understood without more explanation than that.
eng_Latn I'll read a bit to encourage you.
eng_Latn I turn to another sheet and feel a pang of excitement.
eng_Latn (chuckling) That it's always above the NorthPole.
eng_Latn I've seen you as a wolf.
eng_Latn then fell swamping back into the deep.
eng_Latn you shall judge for yourself
eng_Latn a wordless plea
eng_Latn but a verdict a trial sir I ask only for a trial
eng_Latn for he never lifted his head as we approached.
eng_Latn so she wouldn't have to touch him to take them.
eng_Latn being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better
eng_Latn Oowho
eng_Latn I want every girl in the class to know the whole lot of them by the end of the term.
eng_Latn her father's firm and equal.
eng_Latn I always hate to hear of anything like that
eng_Latn but no one was able to substantiate the reports.
eng_Latn I dwelt there once, and still I return when I may.
eng_Latn feeling a deep excitement that he couldn't explain.
eng_Latn beat the quarter all that night.
eng_Latn fell all his length upon his side, where he lay dead
eng_Latn We ll never see the stars the same way again.
eng_Latn How do you confuse a Big Bad Wolf?
eng_Latn some whom he had treated with contumely, and who had tried to cheat him,
eng_Latn I stepped forward and touched the end of my fingers to the scar tissue on his neck.
eng_Latn but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed.
eng_Latn I retreated inside to find a coat.
eng_Latn I've been living in the forest ever since
eng_Latn But that s wonderful.
eng_Latn when the sound of a voice, still at some distance
eng_Latn but he's anxious to have the stone.
eng_Latn I think I have a book about kites. Maybe we could take a look and get some ideas.
eng_Latn without seeming to recollect where he was
eng_Latn I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence.
eng_Latn let them now say that drama is unnatural!
eng_Latn Quite correct Dog. And because people wrote them a long time ago we still know their stories today.
eng_Latn I am sure we can find you something that hasn t been done yet.
eng_Latn but she married three times
eng_Latn I moved a little to see it better
eng_Latn it worked at the rain crust in the corn fields.
eng_Latn they're going to save us all.
eng_Latn what wouldnt I give for a coat like that!
eng_Latn his equal incapacity to contribute to her entertainment, were so obvious that she could not conceal her disappointment.
eng_Latn but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal
eng_Latn had he been as clever in preserving his property
eng_Latn Run left everybody!
eng_Latn then strode swiftly across to the table
eng_Latn I am wrong!
eng_Latn I got to tell you, I ain't a preacher no more.
eng_Latn he had to keep swallowing
eng_Latn Once-upon-an-Outback, many rivalracers were gathering to see who was the fastest and the best
eng_Latn Where did he come from?!
eng_Latn observed him at intervals from the adjoining room.
eng_Latn rained down upon him such a shower of fisticuffs
eng_Latn now, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess
eng_Latn for they are weak, vicious, worthless and rebellious.
eng_Latn he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it.
eng_Latn becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser
eng_Latn I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway.
eng_Latn with the old man among them.
eng_Latn she loves me that way, too.
eng_Latn Please... sit and rest!
eng_Latn or my hand will have lost its cunning.
eng_Latn show him how to avert the danger.
eng_Latn I couldn't do half as well anywhere else.
eng_Latn were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.
eng_Latn rising up startled, he listened and looked in the direction the noise came from
eng_Latn as she made her way towards him through the crowd.
eng_Latn but this attitude of silent and open eyed attention had marked him out for a victim.
eng_Latn we went down to the drawing room again, well pleased and gratified.
eng_Latn she observed her father in the same old winter overcoat he had worn for a dozen years
eng_Latn the delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment.
eng_Latn but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.
eng_Latn I shall lose my way.
eng_Latn she had more of them that she might pray for them.
eng_Latn but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed.
eng_Latn I have something difficult to explain, and I'll need you to be open minded until you understand.
eng_Latn I am determined I will not look up.
eng_Latn his blue eyes very kind
eng_Latn soak it in through every pore.
eng_Latn even the recollection that there was another will
eng_Latn we have always some material basis on which to start our speculation.
eng_Latn or I hope you will come to me.
eng_Latn smelling ditches that were not even deep enough to drown a man.
eng_Latn that something had happened, some one had blundered.
eng_Latn in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf.
eng_Latn Please don t be upset.
eng_Latn when things went his way.
eng_Latn though I stood at the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off.
eng_Latn I've been promoted
eng_Latn I must talk to you.
eng_Latn perhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough to make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of exalting.
eng_Latn but I shall come to that at last.
eng_Latn I do appreciate that allowance.
eng_Latn was apprenticed down here, to a coffin maker
eng_Latn could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.
eng_Latn I was left with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble
eng_Latn with an odd mixture of sadness and sweetness.
eng_Latn it was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs
eng_Latn until he could hardly bear it
eng_Latn crept up behind the captain
eng_Latn to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
eng_Latn so that it was palm up
eng_Latn for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival.
eng_Latn These dog biscuits taste of meatychunks.
eng_Latn I shook my head.
eng_Latn than never to have taken it at all.
eng_Latn Oh oh Wait Pug!
eng_Latn when anything might have happened to her!
eng_Latn assisted her into the buggy.
eng_Latn he observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tall in stature.
eng_Latn this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left us cronies.
eng_Latn had denied any knowledge of it
eng_Latn I glanced up in surprise.
eng_Latn That is a very good quest ion Pug.
eng_Latn we must manage as best we can!
eng_Latn had been allotted a free first class railway pass for life.
eng_Latn finally they led him out of his cell onto the square and there was a long horse trough
eng_Latn then sharp and short and dry
eng_Latn proposed that he should ride with him along the line.
eng_Latn show him that physically at least she was worth his time.
eng_Latn I mean studying hard.
eng_Latn he called, and stumped in at the gate.
eng_Latn which she did not do as a rule.
eng_Latn as if well pleased at seeing a danger averted.
eng_Latn recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.
eng_Latn above all, that you are a great poet.
eng_Latn I insulted him on a perfectly extraneous pretext, jeering at his opinion upon an important public event
eng_Latn I shook my head in despair.
eng_Latn all the more as it will be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.
eng_Latn let this serve you as a lesson.
eng_Latn Well, Dog has a head like a dog
eng_Latn he drew her aside.
eng_Latn This is my pointy hat. It's very important to me.
eng_Latn if yer like, yer shall be a lady.
eng_Latn I ordered a stop to flogging at all the mines.
eng_Latn but valiantly facing everything out to the last, literally died at his post.
eng_Latn I understand all by means of this letter, and understand it correctly.
eng_Latn I'd a tender conscience about that pretty young woman.
eng_Latn I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe.
eng_Latn but he had overcome the feeling by severe argument.
eng_Latn he scrawled his name at the bottom
eng_Latn From the time she was ayoung girl Enid Brighton had a very vivid imagination...
eng_Latn she mutely, and with a sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment.
eng_Latn that the table was a round one
eng_Latn it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time worn face
eng_Latn but, ere she had well secured it
eng_Latn it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it a stupid business.
eng_Latn I can substitute some other plans.
eng_Latn replied the man
eng_Latn these noises meant no more than the chiming of a dull clock in the distance, marking the hours of the night.
eng_Latn I am perfectly aware of it.
eng_Latn you was the first that found me!
eng_Latn two others were three and four years old.
eng_Latn I am no young lady on her preferment.
eng_Latn oh, you remember that day!
eng_Latn your second is to club someone with it.
eng_Latn encountered the personage who had received me last night.
eng_Latn I was glad to get her away from the house.
eng_Latn that the dissensions of those brutes in his country were owing to the same cause with ours
eng_Latn it felt good to talk to her about the pack.
eng_Latn he was dressed just as he had been when he first heard the news
eng_Latn I hesitated, trying to think of some way to get a few seconds alone.
eng_Latn all too human creatures.
eng_Latn I felt, for the time, as if the old days were come back.
eng_Latn I want to know how long I'm gonna have to be here.
eng_Latn a very close friendship began to develop between the teacher and the small child.
eng_Latn the sky had turned to a clear, purple tinged gray
eng_Latn now he had lost his fear.
eng_Latn fastened everything that remained to him of his manhood
eng_Latn since he had interested him with a negotiation of life and death with the emperor
eng_Latn I knew her face too,small and oval
eng_Latn or forever endure the eyes and sympathy of their friends!
eng_Latn than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir.
eng_Latn had no presentiment that he had done anything to repel it.
eng_Latn the bastard kicked me out in such a hurry.
eng_Latn you may be wanted again.
eng_Latn I was not so easily abashed as I had been some years earlier.
eng_Latn yet here's this learned chap, who's lived all his life with books
eng_Latn with that little group of great geniuses
eng_Latn More precious than diamonds.
eng_Latn I'm not going to be tried.
eng_Latn sawed through a piece of meat until it was free of the wire.
eng_Latn as I look back on'tnow, it musta been pretty good.
eng_Latn a big green pond full of frogs.
eng_Latn till an answer came from the scared porter, and he disappeared under the gate.
eng_Latn I've been calling on the bishop,' I said
eng_Latn for a shower and got her a change of clothes.
eng_Latn hating for her to think badly of my pack.
eng_Latn Houdini? The most famous magician who ever lived?
eng_Latn because it created and armed them in the first place.
eng_Latn I swallow hard.
eng_Latn looked around the small apartment
eng_Latn but for the last week or two, anxieties of another nature had come up.
eng_Latn that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried
eng_Latn whereupon they stole off unperceived.
eng_Latn this trait is not quite alien to us
eng_Latn stretched his neck to hear who they were.
eng_Latn which will not yield if after careful deliberation youfind you are wrong.
eng_Latn I love baking but Billy Barkerwouldn t give me a chance, so I pretended to be a Puggle-Wuggle.
eng_Latn who now, with his little eyes and his open neck and flowered cravat, was uncommonly ridiculous and tedious,
eng_Latn since everything that could possibly be done toaid him was already being done.
eng_Latn who was commanded to shoot me dead if I attempted my liberty.
eng_Latn I imagine it's the philosophic slang that bothers you, was all he could say.
eng_Latn at four o'clock, the sun was now two hours above the horizon
eng_Latn I think that will do but it must not be any later.
eng_Latn its diameter 7837 yards, or about four miles and a half
eng_Latn I wasn't sure if I could use the dead boy's flesh.
eng_Latn it was, on the contrary, entirely made up of the pettiest details
eng_Latn whoever makes ill returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of mankind.
eng_Latn a dead silence.
eng_Latn with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle.
eng_Latn I never even looked for where they were venting the tank!
eng_Latn I have not a penny.
eng_Latn addressing the letter in a disguised hand.
eng_Latn you're buying a sorrow that can't talk.
eng_Latn to hand a glass of water without looking
eng_Latn stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it.
eng_Latn who had said she would receive them there.
eng_Latn that the captain was much gratified by their good will.
eng_Latn I couldn' manage to k'leck dat money no way
eng_Latn it felt like I'd gone from being tied to the stake as I burned, to gripping that stake to hold myself in the fire.
eng_Latn to tease you and I saw your eyes glow.
eng_Latn it was about fifteen years old
eng_Latn Uh..Pug. Perhaps we have a book in the shopabout writing exciting stories?
eng_Latn , than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave.
eng_Latn I was worried at first and meant to tell you
eng_Latn I pushed the basket of bread toward her.
eng_Latn yet so well set out was it that it seemed that every part had room to spread itself fittingly
eng_Latn his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment.
eng_Latn the sun was right behind him, and he wasn't wearing _ a hat.
eng_Latn let's check how yeh've done!
eng_Latn not wishing to hear more
eng_Latn her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected
eng_Latn I soon forgot storm in music.
eng_Latn or she had returned the pigeon so that he could send it back to her again.
eng_Latn so that none of them could miss a word
eng_Latn his hair in an uproar of love
eng_Latn BOW WOWZER!!
eng_Latn that was his style
eng_Latn We re sorry... we re sorry... we re sorry!
eng_Latn the mirror with necklaces strung over the side
eng_Latn I never saw so many.
eng_Latn I put the phone away in my bag
eng_Latn how he had arranged to hide himself in the closet
eng_Latn continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.
eng_Latn How curious. There s nothing to see here.
eng_Latn yes nothing more true
eng_Latn so we will sober ourselves with a funeral,
eng_Latn what a relief to get out to the street again!
eng_Latn it had sunk last autumn, overladen with apples.
eng_Latn tried to think with her mother's mind about the question.
eng_Latn he did me the honour to raise it gently to my mouth.
eng_Latn but she interrupted him at the first words.
eng_Latn I have answered your first appeal
eng_Latn her bonnet askew
eng_Latn I felt a deep sense of dread as I wondered how close she'd come to the truth.
eng_Latn I said I wished bigger hats were the fashion
eng_Latn it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone
eng_Latn I looked back up from my homework'comforting
eng_Latn almost before he had righted himself in his saddle
eng_Latn I stopped in my tracks, spinning to face him.
eng_Latn he scrawled his name at the bottom
eng_Latn some spoons andforks and knives and salt and pepper sets
eng_Latn I'll only tell you the idea, without details
eng_Latn a cloud of dust boiled up.
eng_Latn my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
eng_Latn with modesty in their countenances and in their eyes, and lightness in their feet, they looked the best dancers in the world.
eng_Latn I trust, however, that the time here has not been passed unpleasantly to you.
eng_Latn for death is in this house
eng_Latn You can if you like Pug. Hold on.
eng_Latn he was very near never returning.
eng_Latn but the first charm was gone out of their enjoyment.
eng_Latn blocking it from shoulder to shoulder.
eng_Latn so inured by now to the landscape that he derived great amusement from their comments.
eng_Latn I've such an idea for a cotillion!
eng_Latn which he showed in his relations with his comrades and superior officers, commanding both fear and respect, and also at cards,
eng_Latn which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine
eng_Latn induces me to hope
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book! Now I know how to hide my recipe book from those naughty bookshop mice!
eng_Latn spent fifteen days in the voyage.
eng_Latn but they had heard only benign comments concerning the serenade by solo piano.
eng_Latn he realized that it was because it had already turned dark outside.
eng_Latn but do not put me off with platitudes and conventions
eng_Latn I was one of the first there.
eng_Latn twice, he went aloft
eng_Latn it was sport for him.
eng_Latn lie at my full length in the temple.
eng_Latn I paced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot.
eng_Latn the flat brown bottle skidded lightly over the dust.
eng_Latn which someone for some reason had to provide for him.
eng_Latn laying sheepskins on the ground
eng_Latn they were wrapped in a red cloak
eng_Latn hoped nothing like that ever happened to her.
eng_Latn as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy
eng_Latn ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book. And it's given me an idea how to finish my castle costume. But first I need something important.
eng_Latn I reminded myself that she had every right to distrust me.
eng_Latn one of the upper teachers
eng_Latn he possessed the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself.
eng_Latn flung it away from her with a gesture that was noble in the extreme.
eng_Latn explode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly as possible.
eng_Latn as persons of station and culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to converse.
eng_Latn better than from the lighthouse
eng_Latn but here she grew impatient with this legal verbiage, and said
eng_Latn I moved a little to see it better
eng_Latn leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run
eng_Latn while science is authority rightly understood.
eng_Latn that he did not dare to challenge her.
eng_Latn about twelve miles in circumference
eng_Latn I put it back in the box again, and shut the drawer
eng_Latn I gave some ease to myself.
eng_Latn had not been in bed since eleven o'clock
eng_Latn that he would think I was not fit to be even a servant to his son, much less wife?
eng_Latn there lay before us, the last things in the chest
eng_Latn I suddenly felt the urgency of what we had before us today.
eng_Latn I made bold to tell her majesty, that I owed no other obligation to my late master
eng_Latn I felt a pang of unease.
eng_Latn now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient.
eng_Latn but queer tempered I should think, difficult to know.
eng_Latn A rainbow.
eng_Latn Oh No. I'm not a sharing pencil. Ionly draw things FOR you.
eng_Latn I started, or rather was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one and twenty
eng_Latn I knew that I couldn't get herinto that.
eng_Latn soon the whale broke water within two ship's lengths of the hunters.
eng_Latn Dog blew his nose.
eng_Latn she fell into its hands as she had never done before.
eng_Latn is to retain his friendship
eng_Latn It looks like a pepperoni pizza because I kept moving.
eng_Latn I was quartered at an old widow's house, a lieutenant's widow of eighty years of age.
eng_Latn to believe that
eng_Latn Even if they re big and in mybasement and I really need to ask them to leave?
eng_Latn hearing something snap in his verist.
eng_Latn I start to shred my paper coaster into little bits.
eng_Latn was folded one over another.
eng_Latn his remarks upon it
eng_Latn because it permitted her to realize the extreme of unhappiness she had reached.
eng_Latn looking me straight in the eyes, and then turned toMaxim.
eng_Latn maintaining myself by any lawful occupation I may choose.
eng_Latn How would you like to meet a famousartist who could give you a few tips on making pictures?
eng_Latn somebody in the landlady way, or lodging letting way'and marry her, against a rainy day.
eng_Latn the entire middle section was a feature on the war.
eng_Latn it seemed, was, after a night's darkness and a day's sail, within touch.
eng_Latn ragged I may be
eng_Latn but to me, the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world.
eng_Latn he had decided that the first thing to do was to put his arm round her waist
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all..
eng_Latn A daisy? ... Like in a garden?
eng_Latn when things went his way.
eng_Latn (CHUCKLING) Of course I can... I have books!
eng_Latn which was the center of the universe.
eng_Latn you'll drive yourself out of your mind
eng_Latn extending his right hand
eng_Latn I have advised him to do that.
eng_Latn if you eat it
eng_Latn was slow in taking in any other person's idea, and particularly partial to his own.
eng_Latn Perhaps we should come back when they ve put in a lift?
eng_Latn I'm saying nothing.
eng_Latn brought them off without any intermediate exasperation.
eng_Latn there will be two hundred thousand of them.
eng_Latn but she did not dare to speak of it.
eng_Latn said the prince, and entered the drawing room
eng_Latn off they go and take the bridge, cross it
eng_Latn as we reached the first stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass
eng_Latn And it was on that day I made my greatest discovery. ...a robot who had taught itself to forgive. The End.
eng_Latn when we got to the village they yawled us ashore.
eng_Latn but he pitched on me to be his servant.
eng_Latn but the necessity irritated him
eng_Latn here is another thing that comes to me, just now to say.
eng_Latn lighting a cigarand looking for some one who would come and play with him and save himfrom thinking.
eng_Latn did her best to fathom the noble art of prose composition as these masters practised it.
eng_Latn he gave her the same dose as the others.
eng_Latn with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire
eng_Latn I was glad our rooms were in the east wing.
eng_Latn NOW are you satisfied?
eng_Latn I really don't know why you bother.
eng_Latn but if I was to be struck helpless
eng_Latn live my way and die my way.
eng_Latn sat smoking cigarettes without making the least sound.
eng_Latn but, like most of her observations
eng_Latn Phew!
eng_Latn to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.
eng_Latn everybody else was on the ground.
eng_Latn more than I could naturally bear.
eng_Latn I'm not saying we go down there and blow their heads off.
eng_Latn I mean to lodge to night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage
eng_Latn while the children are growing up unhappy, badly educated, and penniless.
eng_Latn I don't know and don't care to know who's there and what.
eng_Latn the feeling of hostility persisted dimly and obscurely.
eng_Latn I tried to remember her face
eng_Latn It's luvvverly! But will it be strong enough?
eng_Latn they move on again.
eng_Latn It’s the start of an adventure Pug. Come on!
eng_Latn he tried to raise himself
eng_Latn there is a sun on the coin fire worshipper, depend upon it.
eng_Latn I care for, it is the interior
eng_Latn as an unqualified fact because no one shared her doubts.
eng_Latn he showed his submission
eng_Latn the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two 'to bear him up
eng_Latn I have a throbbing headache, and I feel on the verge of tears.
eng_Latn that they will only become free
eng_Latn BEGONE!
eng_Latn it is essential that you should do it.
eng_Latn I thought you were all dated up.
eng_Latn I was so busy looking for mine I keelhauled it.
eng_Latn leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.
eng_Latn since some work is easy and some hard, and we should have millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners.
eng_Latn lighting the water pipe
eng_Latn And we are working on a clever plan to find more your majesty.
eng_Latn he had never had the opportunity to study the effects of gold cyanide on a cadaver.
eng_Latn all the fishing tackle hung.
eng_Latn ordered footmen to bring the others
eng_Latn I think I'm going to go talk to her before she sees you, I murmured under my breath.
eng_Latn for where there is smoke, must be fire.
eng_Latn that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks.
eng_Latn if they were stationed all around the school
eng_Latn I stole in on tiptoe.
eng_Latn it would be all right, wouldn't it I could go on the seven.
eng_Latn after swearing that he wouldn't use her to send letters to any of his friends
eng_Latn but it was never said whether she received any reply.
eng_Latn that did not make her a bit less lovable.
eng_Latn I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you?
eng_Latn I can t be any taller than I am!
eng_Latn he is right in this as in all things.
eng_Latn I will show it to you
eng_Latn after some kind expostulations, he was pleased to grant.
eng_Latn No, it is I who should be sorry Pug. I can t ask others for peace and quiet, then start shouting myself.
eng_Latn locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.
eng_Latn you must allow me to press these twenty five roubles upon your acceptance, as something to begin with.
eng_Latn Outrageous!
eng_Latn shut her best soul in prison
eng_Latn if I draw out ten millions on the same day
eng_Latn nothing will persuade me to believe in such a thing.
eng_Latn but they were too different to live together.
eng_Latn pointing her to a different direction.
eng_Latn eager at any cost to escape the fate which seemingly had overtaken her.
eng_Latn you and me must stick close, back to back like
eng_Latn I want to help you.
eng_Latn I detested him just then.
eng_Latn I should do it just to teach the stupid idiot a lesson.
eng_Latn he opened up his arms in the middle of the square
eng_Latn I love her more than anyone,
eng_Latn a healthy peasant of thirty and his young wife.
eng_Latn he had not had time to dream anything.
eng_Latn I have all the convenience for young men like you.
eng_Latn From this...
eng_Latn after two unsuccessful attempts had managed to climb on the raft
eng_Latn I would feel much better if you would permit me to buy you a drink.
eng_Latn the great sperm whale now reigneth!
eng_Latn but I want time to consider how much of what I promised is possible.
eng_Latn as manyas thirty nine in one day.
eng_Latn wide eyed, clasping a hand over her mouth.
eng_Latn Witch Willow! Magic is not supposed to be funny!
eng_Latn the other no less passionately stabbed him in the back.
eng_Latn She can only get covered in mud!
eng_Latn Maybe we can help?
eng_Latn that's not what they wanted for you
eng_Latn said the other, not sounding sorry at all.
eng_Latn it was probably because it was the most convenient.
eng_Latn it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.
eng_Latn besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with
eng_Latn for he shook his head by way of disapprobation.
eng_Latn I've never told this to a living soul before.
eng_Latn I can t stooooooppppp!
eng_Latn I like every one
eng_Latn the police had supposed that he had betaken himself toParis.
eng_Latn so they built a waiter trap
eng_Latn in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.
eng_Latn but the food was good, and there was good wine
eng_Latn Surely Eathorne would not refuse his own pastor.
eng_Latn she has to render this flat habitable for the next tenant.
eng_Latn could revive the unpleasant taste of the past in her heart
eng_Latn all anger and gloom removed, not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true knights errant
eng_Latn And I ll never do another magic trick until I ve learned how to undo it first!
eng_Latn the same in every part of our bodies except as to hairiness and colour, which I have already described.
eng_Latn for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful.
eng_Latn then her left and threw herself into the canal.
eng_Latn like the mist had done.
eng_Latn began walking up and down the market square.
eng_Latn one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love
eng_Latn he can't get one of the servants in line.
eng_Latn we heard voices already
eng_Latn I was with him just before he hanged himself.
eng_Latn even though he had gotten used to the way things were.
eng_Latn I agree that I have none, nor yet any dignity I will tell you why.
eng_Latn as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do his majesty some signal service.
eng_Latn I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy
eng_Latn it has made you look pale.
eng_Latn I'm frightfully busy.
eng_Latn except to blow a loud wet raspberry.
eng_Latn have them sent away and don't go out to them.
eng_Latn it is my particular wish to do it in your presence
eng_Latn with drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored.
eng_Latn everything that he knew, he had learned by himself.
eng_Latn I'll be up on the four o'clock.
eng_Latn so that it was dreadfully apparent
eng_Latn I don't want you to do anything you're not sure about.
eng_Latn next, he had much lesswork, since it was shared.
eng_Latn moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper
eng_Latn You re scared...of those? Butthey re not a something. They re a nothing. And you re a brave knight. Aren t you? (The penny drops) Are you just playing Let's pretend ?
eng_Latn as he threw open the door.
eng_Latn I think he s thought of a something he can do.
eng_Latn she could not command her voice.
eng_Latn I warn you that I shall not admit that you don't know how to write.
eng_Latn because they were all hired on a temporary and occasional basis.
eng_Latn she began to control herself.
eng_Latn you can give me the maker's address, and tell him to have it ready for me.
eng_Latn I met the victim this morning in high spirits.
eng_Latn his face was bright scarlet.
eng_Latn but there is an inspector who takes his place.
eng_Latn a lean, hand some soldier of forty
eng_Latn like me, has come casually here to be drawn into the events for which his scepticism as well as mine seems to entertain a sort of passive contempt.
eng_Latn even if they can do nothing to him in the end
eng_Latn that if you should need me
eng_Latn he should fear nothing except for her.
eng_Latn that I bowed down to the ground for that money!
eng_Latn Plasticity ... Domesticity..Ah..Electricity!
eng_Latn I was an exact _Yahoo_ in every part
eng_Latn were still hurrying to get dressed.
eng_Latn my arms frozen to my body.
eng_Latn in reckoning the numbers of our people, by a computation drawn from the several sects among us, in religion and politics.
eng_Latn what is not ready I'll send after you.
eng_Latn so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.
eng_Latn especially after she began to jitter apart like some indifferently made toy.
eng_Latn you would have deserved well of your country,
eng_Latn given to the society of thieves and scapegraces.
eng_Latn he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life
eng_Latn he might have the wherewithal to take her.
eng_Latn she was saying.
eng_Latn now that it is daylight I count upon finding them when I least expect it
eng_Latn held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words.
eng_Latn understand or endure this sudden rift in their wonderful friendship.
eng_Latn it must be as the blind man would help the lame.
eng_Latn but I won't tell him.
eng_Latn but the stranger stillremained in the same place and the same attitude.
eng_Latn they had stopped for lunch and heard weak cries coming from the south side of town.
eng_Latn the stable boy will guide you through the cross roads.
eng_Latn or as if the soul of the warrior, when he has an army
eng_Latn I hope there's something good for lunch
eng_Latn one hundred and eighty degrees from the last time I'd spoken with her.
eng_Latn she was altogether a mistake
eng_Latn now you'd better go!
eng_Latn he was thinking about the merpeople's song again.
eng_Latn but he soon sighed
eng_Latn I supposed, being shy as she seemed to be, attention would seem like a bad thing to her.
eng_Latn which was cured by three days of treatment at home.
eng_Latn but I will no
eng_Latn but I didn't wait to hear any more.
eng_Latn that's as bad to bear.
eng_Latn I confess I have feelings on the other side also.
eng_Latn bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs
eng_Latn but he cursed and made a disturbance to attract a policeman
eng_Latn the hair dripping with water, the dim gaze that told of physical prostration and disordered nerves.
eng_Latn the air filled with obscenity and ribald language,
eng_Latn ..I think I am losing my voice!
eng_Latn So are these burgers big or small?
eng_Latn that the tunnel is of magical origin and can only be closed magically.
eng_Latn I can't wait.
eng_Latn recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.
eng_Latn found a woman near me upon the path.
eng_Latn but also, I suppose, to better himself.
eng_Latn it's supposed to light up and spin.
eng_Latn Do you do seconds?
eng_Latn to prevent her from marrying anybody else.
eng_Latn therefore we should have been mutually guilty in any case.
eng_Latn four had been provided
eng_Latn wherever you go
eng_Latn although she did not look in the least like what he had seen in the mirror.
eng_Latn I decided that I must escape at once, if ever.
eng_Latn found her one of the most beautiful people she had ever known.
eng_Latn Although they are quite smelly.
eng_Latn well, he'd hand 'em something that would surprise 'em.
eng_Latn Please... Help yourself -
eng_Latn we said so because we had nothing to fight for there
eng_Latn if the appearance of listening to deplorable balderdash must form part of the price he had to pay for being left unmolested
eng_Latn I want peace of mind and trust, and I will take the blame on myself.
eng_Latn but I felt disinclined to go and look at them
eng_Latn its flickerings awoke him
eng_Latn I jumped a little at the sound of my new name.
eng_Latn I mean to lodge to night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage
eng_Latn I'd been a little bit too clever and put my foot in it.
eng_Latn then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.
eng_Latn but they have all snub noses,
eng_Latn but that he had it and peace completeand secure.
eng_Latn hard earned savings and indulging in a suit of this kind.
eng_Latn as he jerked back around toward me.
eng_Latn who hastily left the room
eng_Latn I'll have her in my arms again!
eng_Latn I might be able to be of some service.
eng_Latn yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment.
eng_Latn how he had looked when he slipped it on her finger.
eng_Latn I shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace
eng_Latn just because he wasn't invited to come in on it.
eng_Latn the congratulation on their long postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse than usual?
eng_Latn live at home with my wife and children.
eng_Latn I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
eng_Latn a little oil still lay in the wells.
eng_Latn she maneuvered it free
eng_Latn then satisfying herself by her eyes that it was he
eng_Latn the tenderness of corpses whichshould return to embrace the living.
eng_Latn I lose my temper on the slightest provocation, flare up, and then it's all over.
eng_Latn they looked well fed, too, and had whole uniforms.
eng_Latn it recurred several times
eng_Latn holding it as if it were made of glass
eng_Latn but this conversation had taken place in the street.
eng_Latn Bring it over here and we ll share the sandwiches together.
eng_Latn only thinly repressed for the first moment or two
eng_Latn they examined all, talked of everything till to the end of dinner.
eng_Latn to see where love was hurting him
eng_Latn And we get our very special prize?
eng_Latn it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes
eng_Latn such as forcing locks or
eng_Latn this has to happen.
eng_Latn Are you the new balancing act?
eng_Latn one of the upper teachers
eng_Latn ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass.
eng_Latn there seemed to be a lot of cars standing about.
eng_Latn that by the time they had been married for thirty years they were like a single divided being
eng_Latn so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom
eng_Latn a low, mossy swell was my pillow.
eng_Latn I'll be bound he is.
eng_Latn unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.
eng_Latn as if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor.
eng_Latn he told me that he had arranged for his wife to have a private room
eng_Latn I mean, it would have been fine, if ' what I mean is, if you give me another chance, I'll do better.
eng_Latn Forever is a very long time Max.
eng_Latn said a drawling voice from behind them.
eng_Latn but still it was a chance, wasn't it?
eng_Latn I should be very unhappy.
eng_Latn you must think it over.
eng_Latn his energetic mind slumbered
eng_Latn the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.
eng_Latn remember that, wretch,
eng_Latn had courage and leisure for saying it.
eng_Latn a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude.
eng_Latn This is the final puzzle boys – but there s only one minute left!
eng_Latn asking your pardon.
eng_Latn I used to divide my soup and beans with you
eng_Latn it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.
eng_Latn or perhaps and this is more probable this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted
eng_Latn tied her cravat
eng_Latn he could not have been more than thirty
eng_Latn I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,
eng_Latn the ideal man who was in love with her.
eng_Latn no doubt my good father hit the truth in every particular
eng_Latn I have loved my misery.
eng_Latn I was surprised to observe that by the gate there stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms
eng_Latn then I've found him and I want to go to bed with him.
eng_Latn but it doesn't make any real difference
eng_Latn I'll tell you how to find them.
eng_Latn it was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.
eng_Latn I've had a hellish time.
eng_Latn I had to call for my master's assistance in coaxing him out of bed.
eng_Latn I replied that the money had been all my own.
eng_Latn in the feeling she excites in me.
eng_Latn was full of his insular prejudices, and rather distrustful of all aliens
eng_Latn did they have the opportunity to speak to each other.
eng_Latn I was so dreadfully in love with you.
eng_Latn Hear that, Dog? I'm a genius.
eng_Latn but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said.
eng_Latn Now I be the captain you plank-walking plankton. Get the oars and get ready to row. I wants to go water-skiing!
eng_Latn transporting the rest.
eng_Latn with none of the rather wandering attention span typical of a four year old.
eng_Latn soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner.
eng_Latn in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying.
eng_Latn Warning! Lots and lots ofmeteorites are heading your way!
eng_Latn pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves
eng_Latn was very urgent for a favourable answer.
eng_Latn I took up the vessel with much difficulty in both hands.
eng_Latn I HAD led this life about a month
eng_Latn his voice boomed out across the dark water toward the stands.
eng_Latn Not by the hairs on your chinnychin chin!!
eng_Latn afterwards into what was to be the drawing room
eng_Latn you'll have to come ostensibly as my assistant.
eng_Latn when their own skins were in danger
eng_Latn it is such an object of worship with me, and I love it so, that
eng_Latn she could scarcely swallow two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her
eng_Latn I lifted it to my nose to see if it was the same copy.
eng_Latn What a sad story.
eng_Latn one of those men somewhat exceptional
eng_Latn he could find one where he might dwell.
eng_Latn for allowing me to sound you
eng_Latn I had acquired a certain degree of readiness andcorrectness in the language
eng_Latn if you devote yourself to it, you get on.
eng_Latn having behind it the village, and in front of it theslope, which was tolerably steep then.
eng_Latn she went in and began to play the piano.
eng_Latn he might send it in the morning.
eng_Latn until at each step of the camel he bumped down on her hinder quarters with a crash
eng_Latn which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense
eng_Latn at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily.
eng_Latn lie at my full length in the temple.
eng_Latn I have to go and gather my sheep and get going.
eng_Latn Glad to have ye on me side mates.Let's do it!
eng_Latn save me again!
eng_Latn for, after the previous night's experience, he was afraid of losing it.
eng_Latn I'll save him for you!
eng_Latn This is a book about a world whereit's always dark. And it is called...
eng_Latn until she reached the pillar box.
eng_Latn I must think pray.
eng_Latn I folded the paper
eng_Latn with a shock of thick black hair.
eng_Latn but it never entered my head that it was you,
eng_Latn if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.
eng_Latn lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance, folded them across his stomach
eng_Latn I shall not understand you, but I shall listen to you.
eng_Latn to be cuffed and buffeted through the world
eng_Latn having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery, which was decreed for me with costs.
eng_Latn I was going to sell for eighty or more
eng_Latn on his head he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host
eng_Latn I doubt if he'll ever learn.
eng_Latn Allow us to be of assistance.
eng_Latn I was lost to a sea of cold
eng_Latn but well away from the land, at least ten miles out.
eng_Latn I don't think you meant to kill anyone.
eng_Latn Perhaps Pug could try
eng_Latn because it is luminous, and because it is impenetrable.
eng_Latn cracked it over his own head
eng_Latn my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing
eng_Latn with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.
eng_Latn with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.
eng_Latn his deployed squadron rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons.
eng_Latn he had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull his hand off.
eng_Latn fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the first
eng_Latn laid the watch in the palm.
eng_Latn I tried to remember thisto remember painbut I couldn't.
eng_Latn you yourself swear that it waslast in your hands before it reached the water.
eng_Latn visit uninhabited territories
eng_Latn as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for that there were no more charges.
eng_Latn I was sitting by him one night
eng_Latn I would have expected walls stretching the entire length of the boundaries.
eng_Latn I hoped she wasn't so dissatisfied that she would skip the questions I was waiting for.
eng_Latn she had wondered why this particular beast was not so much in evidence these days.
eng_Latn the one pulled up his ass by the halter, the other his hack by the bridle
eng_Latn that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion.
eng_Latn but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism
eng_Latn he had given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction.
eng_Latn from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional
eng_Latn the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me.
eng_Latn as though we ourselves had left but yesterday
eng_Latn for I will set it to rights at the first village where there is a blacksmith
eng_Latn I put the fear of fire on him, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much snivelling and snarling.
eng_Latn now it was that there lurked a something in the old man's eyes
eng_Latn i told him as I should have to take you away.
eng_Latn but I must know exactly where this treasure is,
eng_Latn I think I more or less got the gist.
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and stand up.
eng_Latn I asked it was a relief to say the words out loud at last.
eng_Latn I took the clothes gingerly between my teethughand carried them back to the trees.
eng_Latn I thought it better to tell you, my dear.
eng_Latn if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.
eng_Latn the infliction of her unlovable body which people could not bear to see.
eng_Latn I can give you a ride home
eng_Latn at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right
eng_Latn I'll help you till you can get some work.
eng_Latn which might be regretted even by a philosopher
eng_Latn I was sent down south to a hospital
eng_Latn so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip.
eng_Latn a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave.
eng_Latn You re looking very smart today Dog.
eng_Latn jabbing his wand at the list
eng_Latn as I had ample reason to know
eng_Latn I stayed clear of his head after that.
eng_Latn but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble.
eng_Latn she could then exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she must act.
eng_Latn so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly,
eng_Latn a pair of shoes for embarking and disembarking
eng_Latn not so rare a thing in the theatrical profession
eng_Latn he slept soundly
eng_Latn I have nothing particular.
eng_Latn so now she could not even hire a rig.
eng_Latn even then I could detect in the old lady's tone and manner a great change.
eng_Latn not caring to wait for the notary who had gone for the sword
eng_Latn four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight
eng_Latn pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.
eng_Latn it can go badly wrong if you don't know what you're doing
eng_Latn she assured me she would not complain.
eng_Latn I never doubted some woman might be found
eng_Latn that his brother had a littledaughter whom he would bring with him
eng_Latn she concealed her close scrutiny of him
eng_Latn I must talk with you of a grave and painful subject.
eng_Latn others had thrust themselves into his life and thwarted his purposes.
eng_Latn the bare coffin having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers
eng_Latn nothing to really worry about except for the very old and the very young.
eng_Latn when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise
eng_Latn others, to the betraying of their country or their prince
eng_Latn you may find yourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.
eng_Latn I got up and walked from the room.
eng_Latn following the example of others in the same case
eng_Latn that from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded.
eng_Latn as if he were considering that.
eng_Latn but then I thought that perhaps she despised me too much to feel any resentment against me.
eng_Latn that had never happened before.
eng_Latn he knew and felt it suddenly at the very moment of his ecstasy.
eng_Latn I love you more, better than before,
eng_Latn waiting there, she thought
eng_Latn was lean and stooped somewhat
eng_Latn when I thought I had nearly done enough,
eng_Latn where he was walking about waiting for his guest's departure.
eng_Latn waved it several times in the air.
eng_Latn but I was young and stupid
eng_Latn there must indeed.
eng_Latn this new desk arrived the other day, and she just took it
eng_Latn I ruther starve all over at oncet.
eng_Latn I'll tell the prisoner so.
eng_Latn talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses.
eng_Latn divided by two upright gratings
eng_Latn so these adventures were carried out.
eng_Latn was now so exalted that he could not take it in in his imagination.
eng_Latn he had committed in pursuing and eventually allowing him self to fail into this unhallowed relationship with her
eng_Latn my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.
eng_Latn I informed her that he sent his compliments, and was getting on very well indeed.
eng_Latn I thought all this very pretty and engaging
eng_Latn whose son overlooks and directs everything here.
eng_Latn his daughter had followed him
eng_Latn when a strange trembling seized her
eng_Latn there is bad literature
eng_Latn was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean.
eng_Latn he had better melt it down and make a golden coffin out of it for his starved child
eng_Latn handsome and pale in a silvery mist of white hair and clipped beard
eng_Latn the clouds, now trooping before the wind, were filing off eastward in long, silvered columns.
eng_Latn now you've only to try to do the second half and you are saved.
eng_Latn I know I love you.
eng_Latn he invited him to drive with him to his country villa and to the races.
eng_Latn got his feet upon the form close by, and sat upon the desk.
eng_Latn I scarcely know how we got through that day.
eng_Latn that's why he wanted to marry me!
eng_Latn I don't need to get involved in anything like this, .
eng_Latn too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.
eng_Latn she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den a goblin's cell.
eng_Latn swerved to hit it.
eng_Latn the potion looked like thick, dark mud
eng_Latn where there was no mail and no telegraph
eng_Latn I don't think I could stand it.
eng_Latn but which was borne upon the wind, reached hiM
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shop that might help you see things differently.
eng_Latn make an end of me.
eng_Latn with something of the archangelic manner he told her how he had undertaken to show that
eng_Latn Yes Pug?
eng_Latn or as badly as possible, and would discourage his father.
eng_Latn reversed the gun, gripped it by the barrel, and swung it clubwise.
eng_Latn effacing and unselfish and loving and brave she was good through and through.
eng_Latn I know that, father.
eng_Latn Let's congratulate George instead.
eng_Latn look at yer mum!
eng_Latn I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.
eng_Latn that now she was better and out of serious danger, but still in a nervous, hysterical state.
eng_Latn ten in number leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.
eng_Latn don't blurt it out as you did to me.
eng_Latn I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.
eng_Latn Remarkable Pug. How did you know this would happen?
eng_Latn with a mustard pot in one hand and a vinegar cruet in the other
eng_Latn I took a deep breath, willing myself into composure.
eng_Latn was like a war won against the steely fist
eng_Latn there came a sudden loud screech from behind him
eng_Latn there's nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear, n
eng_Latn I go for all
eng_Latn probably this basket with pink ribbon.
eng_Latn I stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck
eng_Latn steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother's.
eng_Latn as it is of no use complaining to you. I mean to complain to your husband.
eng_Latn that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the night.
eng_Latn he shook his head
eng_Latn I believe you, she said, but in such a manner in the manner of which, at times, she was a mistress
eng_Latn forced by brutal circumstance into a distasteful position, a helpless little lady who would probably starve if customers didn't buy her lumber.
eng_Latn I understand thee still less now
eng_Latn he might jerk the bonnet right off her head and give it to some other girl.
eng_Latn that if he should chance to meet her alone somewhere in the street, he would venture to speak to her.
eng_Latn he is so noble and generous that he has promised it to me ever so many times.
eng_Latn Feeling Good.. Feeling Bad... Aah Feeling Frazzled.
eng_Latn I must know more about it.
eng_Latn who entering the gate of this castle at this moment
eng_Latn my dear this is a great loss for us all
eng_Latn just something he instinctively offered when he saw what lay in the grey eyes.
eng_Latn I am sure there is something the matter.
eng_Latn I assured his honour, that the law was a science in which I had not much conversed
eng_Latn just to show that we don't think any less of him than our friends do.
eng_Latn heard it break someplace else
eng_Latn while I shouted after her once more that the secret should be kept sacred.
eng_Latn I'm not a top businesswoman at all.
eng_Latn a car will be waiting to take you out to the country.
eng_Latn the gentlemen balanced gold mounted canes between their knees.
eng_Latn I'd counted on him to be on my side.
eng_Latn their country and ours were at peace.
eng_Latn your attitude to me.
eng_Latn giving way grudgingly and sifting dirt down onto the basement floor
eng_Latn it would scarcely be fair to accept your education and then go off and not use it.
eng_Latn which became to me from that time forth a place of awe and dread
eng_Latn of speaking to him when no one overheard.
eng_Latn I'll come tomorrow.
eng_Latn he was forced to call to his master to wait for him.
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn I must think of some way to let him know.
eng_Latn I don t!
eng_Latn one single soldier left behind
eng_Latn for which reason the reed delayed its appearance for four days
eng_Latn not pleased at having to justify himself
eng_Latn he was not less contemptuous when the two heads were accepted.
eng_Latn because I know you can tell it better than any one.
eng_Latn but when I get married, it will be forever.
eng_Latn with this booty I made a hasty retreat.
eng_Latn next to the bare expanse of his back.
eng_Latn I literally could not make contact with the ball.
eng_Latn I smell a rat...or a unicorn!
eng_Latn clearly worried about having hurt me.
eng_Latn Now what?
eng_Latn told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two
eng_Latn she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump
eng_Latn there I was ordered to choose half adozen dresses.
eng_Latn I turn away and pretend to be reorganizing my top drawer.
eng_Latn which as well as I remember was three thousand ducatsa piece in cash
eng_Latn but purity, as an attribute of existence, had never entered his mind.
eng_Latn Yes, please Pug - but it's hardwork.
eng_Latn instructed by his cousin and the foreman asto the various rules
eng_Latn I might not even speak to him.
eng_Latn I don't know how he escaped from the morgue.
eng_Latn Very careful Dog.
eng_Latn they heard footsteps outside in the corridor again
eng_Latn If there s a Biggest Digger I don twant to hear it's horn!
eng_Latn I didn't do it against their will.
eng_Latn but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation
eng_Latn These big burgers are big!
eng_Latn seizing the boy by one leg and one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the hall
eng_Latn reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain.
eng_Latn I began to distinguish between tripe and not tripe.
eng_Latn only I didn't wish to mortify you.
eng_Latn evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing
eng_Latn if they were fortunate in choosing their sisters in law!
eng_Latn I was right on him before I could shirk.
eng_Latn but she declined availing herself of it
eng_Latn a giant wave picked him up and shot him toward the beach at the speed of a catapult.
eng_Latn I must try.
eng_Latn feeling for each step, watching as their campfire receded with agonizing slowness.
eng_Latn that for the rest of the trip she took no pleasure in the memory of her earlier trip, as she had longed to do
eng_Latn I have my reputation to protect.
eng_Latn transmute itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation.
eng_Latn yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.
eng_Latn It's the missing jigsaw piece Pug!
eng_Latn began to stir feverishly.
eng_Latn I need not go into details because the whole world will hear about it within the next twenty four hours.
eng_Latn held four roosters and upward of forty hens.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn shall see if I am a man to be frightened by lions.
eng_Latn because it is dried by the sun
eng_Latn I went down right away to the cottage.
eng_Latn one glass wouldn't hurt me.
eng_Latn the necessity of marriage avoided.
eng_Latn but I'll be back next week.
eng_Latn by prayer and repentance it may be removed.
eng_Latn rising with great force, the coffin life buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.
eng_Latn is connected with the person of whom we were speaking
eng_Latn I know the tune for him.
eng_Latn which he mentioned with horror.
eng_Latn so into the kitchen he went.
eng_Latn the right flank too extended, he went on.
eng_Latn I tried to touch them as little as possible.
eng_Latn the dungeon dissolved again.
eng_Latn I want to embrace.
eng_Latn put me down at my door
eng_Latn I was on the verge of dying when you came.
eng_Latn Now, your Majesty, we hide!
eng_Latn for it has nothing else to explain it.
eng_Latn getting off his ass briskly
eng_Latn I am sorry to say I must do so, madame
eng_Latn in which I struggled nakedly to my feet, and rocked moaning in wonder that it was not a dream
eng_Latn but the alchemist helped him out of the tent.
eng_Latn look out for squalls
eng_Latn the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath.
eng_Latn had never had a moment's hesitation about doing what he ought to do.
eng_Latn it is three days now since anything has been seen of him
eng_Latn but for the first time picturing to himself her soul.
eng_Latn so that without hindrance she may run her course freely to attain the desired perfection
eng_Latn The Adventures of Susi Squirrel
eng_Latn raised his eyes, and instantly dropped them again.
eng_Latn if his adversary does not come, on him lies the disgrace
eng_Latn they're wavering enough already.
eng_Latn is connected with the person of whom we were speaking
eng_Latn that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society.
eng_Latn chokingly they had saidthat it might be the last home either of them would ever have.
eng_Latn cupping his hands to the glass in an effort to peer in.
eng_Latn Who will now magically change places. Abracadabra!
eng_Latn with his face turned to the frosted window.
eng_Latn I'm sorry I entertained the thought.
eng_Latn I don t know Dog. The world s firstmaze was built in... I can t remember!
eng_Latn when everyone was just confused and scared?
eng_Latn but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him.
eng_Latn who had slain him.
eng_Latn I'll tell you what I know
eng_Latn I reflected that she might, possibly, have taken it into her head to walk about the garden, for refreshment.
eng_Latn for you look so grown up and unlike yourself
eng_Latn so that I didn't know she was dead till the sister told me.
eng_Latn I be giving it a go!
eng_Latn as white as a sheet
eng_Latn ordered his men to go out and fight in the street.
eng_Latn much to the amusement of his young friends.
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder Dog?
eng_Latn fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.
eng_Latn but I may truly say I came back disappointed.
eng_Latn that is why this movement took place and those are its laws.
eng_Latn but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.
eng_Latn I wanted to come straight back to you.
eng_Latn Wait! It won t hurt you!
eng_Latn I felt ashamed to look him in the face.
eng_Latn whether we remain united, or whether we part.
eng_Latn cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, _Hekinah degul_.
eng_Latn go places and then well, gee
eng_Latn This is rather a dangerous world if you re the size of a mini beast.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn but must have examples that are palpable, easy,
eng_Latn that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.
eng_Latn could mention historical examples before unknown to her.
eng_Latn Now let s make a picture!
eng_Latn will punish traitors
eng_Latn he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ship's bulwarks
eng_Latn I told you that once before and you weren't enough of a gentleman to understand.
eng_Latn a friend told him, with his wife present
eng_Latn a small box of ours under his arm
eng_Latn Time for an adventure!
eng_Latn bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in those gloomy depths.
eng_Latn snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window.
eng_Latn that I had a lazy apprehension of the great deep rising in the night.
eng_Latn I certainly do forget to think of her
eng_Latn blindly stumbled back into his shop, bolting the door behind him.
eng_Latn had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously.
eng_Latn till her wandering gaze came to the group of miniatures
eng_Latn I telephoned to the nurse that we were coming
eng_Latn you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.
eng_Latn I have to take a drug test every six months just to make sure I'm clean
eng_Latn I cant get through all the red tape
eng_Latn several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter
eng_Latn when it was as complete as I could possibly make it
eng_Latn Ah ah ah Hem.. All was quiet in the enchanted forest when suddenly -
eng_Latn in five minutes more she shut it up.
eng_Latn but she could not help admitting that there was a grain of brutal truth in the words.
eng_Latn I'm due back at nineteen thirty.
eng_Latn I would rather have the explanation from someone more central to the story, my friend.
eng_Latn there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child.
eng_Latn I don't think that women ought to sit down at table with men.
eng_Latn I as brought him up porochially
eng_Latn not to let the police know that he is still on the moor.
eng_Latn I observed several splashes of blood about the bark of the tree
eng_Latn just as I heard a massive crack.
eng_Latn but on the contrary have benefited mankind
eng_Latn Pug, Bedtime Baboon should bearound here somewhere.
eng_Latn they would remember him.
eng_Latn he had foolishly drunk all of his water
eng_Latn she did not think it was decent to accept without the consent of her fiance.
eng_Latn lest we were attacked
eng_Latn how she would love him become quite different
eng_Latn to such a degree that seven men were unable to lift him and they had to drag him to the bed.
eng_Latn carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all.
eng_Latn I furnished myself with a light
eng_Latn and the abbe accompanied him to the door
eng_Latn which faded out, with no reply.
eng_Latn but he did not dare ask him a question.
eng_Latn I granted them that and escorted them to the coast myself.
eng_Latn I don't want your advice.
eng_Latn they were bored and cross.
eng_Latn I saw you going up the creek there with him a while ago.
eng_Latn when her husband stood upon his feet
eng_Latn a pity but I am in a situation now where I am forced to sell it.
eng_Latn her spirit always calm and her back unbowed, even in the deaths of her three baby sons.
eng_Latn give to every man that which is his
eng_Latn not that it is bad or ill told
eng_Latn he had faltered in his affectation of amused superiority before that insignificant chit of a school girl.
eng_Latn reads law and all stuff like that.
eng_Latn that ain't any use.
eng_Latn but it had been blocked from view
eng_Latn for in such matters, too, he had gained experience.
eng_Latn I regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us
eng_Latn but his easy patronage soon put that to rights, and made me quite at home.
eng_Latn I take the key from her and look at it in fascination
eng_Latn he says he's lost one eye for good
eng_Latn continue to be my nurse and instructor.
eng_Latn famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided.
eng_Latn fell like stones to the ground.
eng_Latn I was told to put it in the post.
eng_Latn I wouldn't be able to stand being close to her for very long.
eng_Latn in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements.
eng_Latn to perform another lap of honor on their brooms
eng_Latn We re coming Granny Pug!
eng_Latn Perhaps I can find your treasure MrBeards. I am a dog and dogs have noses. What does your something special smell like?
eng_Latn the situation of one, and the language of the other, so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty,
eng_Latn I was chiefly disgusted with modern history.
eng_Latn so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it.
eng_Latn to that poor queen whom I saw pass in the tumbril!
eng_Latn he ordered these words to be repeated.
eng_Latn that he paid the fare thereof ' ere the craft did sail.
eng_Latn knowing that she didnot want to be noticed.
eng_Latn realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it.
eng_Latn as if he were a ragged boy who had stolen turnips.
eng_Latn wedged them into the marrow bone above my waist where I stuck for some time.
eng_Latn I hope went a little deeper than his missile.
eng_Latn he recovered it on a strange dawn and in a room that was completely foreign
eng_Latn I might find somewhere where I can finish my book.
eng_Latn I only want to do what's right.
eng_Latn but not with him.
eng_Latn my little nurse ran to my relief
eng_Latn holding the lamp aloft and went down the first three steps
eng_Latn after breakfast haddock, grilled kidneys, toast and marmalade, and a pot of coffee I felt better.
eng_Latn I can't have that on my conscience.
eng_Latn that no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial building
eng_Latn the sum of my discourse had been interpreted, as before, to the rest of the company
eng_Latn as if she, too, had suffered from that inexplicable feminine obtuseness
eng_Latn she carried a mop and pail in her hands.
eng_Latn in guerdon of this news, as unexpected as it is good
eng_Latn for something very profound had changed in his heart
eng_Latn now they knew why it was forbidden.
eng_Latn but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle.
eng_Latn after searching for his wounds could find none
eng_Latn went out in the middle of a solo and drove home.
eng_Latn had no desire to repeat the experience.
eng_Latn just at that moment came the first news of the attack.
eng_Latn with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which
eng_Latn I did not expect you today
eng_Latn Hoo hoo hoo! Aa aa aa aa!
eng_Latn was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed
eng_Latn it was plain from the first
eng_Latn I most certainly can blame him!
eng_Latn I am dreadfully afraid.
eng_Latn he pointed to a chubby boy with curly hair
eng_Latn particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat
eng_Latn she moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I couldn't sleep.
eng_Latn about 1925 in fact it even crossed my mind that I might have done so.
eng_Latn but they could not get to sleep
eng_Latn struggled through, marbling the clouds with strange prismatic colours as it passed.
eng_Latn he concluded emphatically, and went out of the room.
eng_Latn I don't mean confessing.
eng_Latn a thousand more inventions so ingenious and unusual
eng_Latn had furniture put in, and china.
eng_Latn all my life I had this feeling that something wonderful was about to happen to me.
eng_Latn she hardly seemed to have noticed it.
eng_Latn but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.
eng_Latn Perhaps it goes on forever!
eng_Latn throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring bolt there
eng_Latn I went through the hall and up the great stairs
eng_Latn but the wolf turned its head to face her
eng_Latn Do not worry, Pug and Mice. There sone thing that s certain to help.
eng_Latn she rose out of it with an angry screech
eng_Latn it was dark, hot, and alive with the softly whirring wings of the barnswallows.
eng_Latn she needed this so for what lay before her
eng_Latn in a rush of snot and relief, it emerged.
eng_Latn I stare at the sheet blankly
eng_Latn it is immediately, and by a thunderbolt, that I must repel the flash of lightning which, for a moment, startled me
eng_Latn flinging up his head.
eng_Latn till we start south.
eng_Latn as to set aside all impediments
eng_Latn I don't know.
eng_Latn as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors.
eng_Latn let one of us stay at the gate
eng_Latn I crossed my legs and practiced my blinks.
eng_Latn namely, to find a man who will not fight
eng_Latn he therefore fixed three months
eng_Latn like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him.
eng_Latn I turned back to the front door, which I'd left open
eng_Latn which she did not do as a rule.
eng_Latn a pair of shoes for embarking and disembarking
eng_Latn I hope I shall live to join your hands.
eng_Latn I feel like she's slapped me awake from a dream.
eng_Latn though there's many a common man would say better what he meant.
eng_Latn there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.
eng_Latn to whom she belonged heart and soul.
eng_Latn go and pass the night at the inn instead of stopping at the hermitage, where the cousin would have had them halt.
eng_Latn a marriage between a questionable woman and a young fellow who might be a flunkey.
eng_Latn I got thinking how we was holy when we was one thing
eng_Latn with a double chin and full red lips, entered carrying a large loaded tray.
eng_Latn if we'd caught one of them rascals.
eng_Latn where I saw a very comely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches upon mats of straw
eng_Latn his gold eyes watched me warily.
eng_Latn Let's think about this, Pug. What did we do yesterday?
eng_Latn did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not.
eng_Latn where it must be much nicer than in thefactory here in this weather.
eng_Latn I'm here
eng_Latn thinking about what he had just heard
eng_Latn I didn't know he'd get here this quickly.
eng_Latn as the people above him gasped
eng_Latn with dignity put his hand into the old man's hairy palm.
eng_Latn her father's firm and equal.
eng_Latn a dozen children were propped up at little side tables in the same room
eng_Latn but he said nothing to her about his love.
eng_Latn although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly well.
eng_Latn he flung it off, and muttered, if she did not give over, he would break her neck.
eng_Latn so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites
eng_Latn even if the whole human race favours him.
eng_Latn I can t wait to meet Camille Dog.
eng_Latn but when he reached it he found it was a road.
eng_Latn I'll always be in easy reach.
eng_Latn What drawing have we drawn Dog?
eng_Latn but by the end of the year it was believed that the danger of an epidemic had been averted.
eng_Latn but it was only mingled with other causes in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf
eng_Latn you needn't tell that.
eng_Latn she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each other.
eng_Latn you should be engaged without my knowing it
eng_Latn Rocks have tentacles?!... No!
eng_Latn whether there are bad consequences or not.
eng_Latn two others the doctor and a valet lay on the floor.
eng_Latn I remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers.
eng_Latn she found herself well matched in a partner.
eng_Latn it was only by severity that you could keep him within bounds.
eng_Latn has been so impressed by his mental and business acumen
eng_Latn wherein I was, however, much assisted by his majesty's ship carpenters
eng_Latn I havent got a single skeleton left to hide from you
eng_Latn the violin played for her alone.
eng_Latn I love the smell of them!
eng_Latn when there was no other partner in the room.
eng_Latn so you must go at once and make a bargain with him.
eng_Latn at anymoment might approach and so learn the meaning of his arrest.
eng_Latn if anyone wants to know anything more about me
eng_Latn though the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible facial distortion
eng_Latn there, my master leaning on his lance
eng_Latn a single minute later he was dressed
eng_Latn I could maybe ask him what he thinks
eng_Latn easing his sword in the scabbard
eng_Latn half insane with fears she didn't understand
eng_Latn from there sent the nation a call to general war.
eng_Latn that is to say, had said only just what they were thinking and feeling
eng_Latn she stood a moment to look out .
eng_Latn with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him.
eng_Latn such was her darkness
eng_Latn as she never could have imagined thinking about anyone
eng_Latn door after door flew open along the corridor
eng_Latn he, like a good knight, resolved to add on the name of his
eng_Latn I was like her own father, and she was my child.
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn Thank-you Doris!
eng_Latn this new and amazing social and emotional victory of his.
eng_Latn which she had erected in her thought for a sign of perfect competency in the business of living.
eng_Latn bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.
eng_Latn the countess has only to wish it
eng_Latn I turned to the sound of my name being called
eng_Latn he seemed to become conscious that it was in hers too.
eng_Latn but what's got into your head?
eng_Latn The Big Bad Wolf sounds close. I llnever get this pizza to Grandma s safely.
eng_Latn the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street
eng_Latn but with much more advantage to the captain
eng_Latn that the passage to it is speedy.
eng_Latn I must have him off.
eng_Latn to see that no one was concealed
eng_Latn And so are Tina and me...as a team!
eng_Latn then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute.
eng_Latn back past the long line of men, and past the baggage into the emptiness behind.
eng_Latn made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid across two barrels.
eng_Latn he had sworn never to come near the place again.
eng_Latn she was sent to the infirmary and examined.
eng_Latn took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.
eng_Latn then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat.
eng_Latn or to imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.
eng_Latn gasped for breath, and let out a hoarse shriek.
eng_Latn I am looking for a cat. Have youseen one?
eng_Latn but she wants to be married, and so she's been thinking of getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now she's got it, that is, not a husband but a baby.
eng_Latn with what soever measure ye mete, it will bemeasured unto ye again.
eng_Latn This IS a friendly forest Pug.
eng_Latn playing the piano and writing things which sounded beautiful
eng_Latn I am perfectly aware of it.
eng_Latn but I will not quarrel with YOUR light answer.
eng_Latn fenders battered and hammered back.
eng_Latn There s nobody here except... A penguin and a penguin and apenguin. They don t look cold at all.
eng_Latn then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink
eng_Latn rather flustered by this onslaught.
eng_Latn I said I would inform them when our search was complete.
eng_Latn then came back into the compartment and rolled the door shut.
eng_Latn do not move!
eng_Latn I know nothing about it and won't begin proceedings
eng_Latn holding his camera.
eng_Latn I hoped to save her life before I killed the monster.
eng_Latn he would have found some money.
eng_Latn so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today.
eng_Latn she could not escape.
eng_Latn above the average in height
eng_Latn I am not altogether out of hopes, in some time, to suffer a neighbour _Yahoo_ in my company
eng_Latn for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play
eng_Latn but, except the breathing, there was no sign of life.
eng_Latn I thought he was the villain, not a hero.
eng_Latn then put him back in the wild!
eng_Latn I was so hurt by her coldness and scepticism, that the tears rose to my eyes.
eng_Latn but it was only a second centaur, black haired and bodied
eng_Latn I pulled my hand free so that we could race back.
eng_Latn of my hundred names I need only tell you one, to overwhelm you!
eng_Latn or had deserted her
eng_Latn I don't disagree with you there.
eng_Latn Granny s Book of Records.
eng_Latn he abandoned all self respect.
eng_Latn they were empty, stupid, contented fellows
eng_Latn I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an instrument
eng_Latn so harshly that the child started up from the floor
eng_Latn as some of the others were beginning to depart
eng_Latn until he felt the eyes of a white man upon him.
eng_Latn meaning to breakfast, but succeeded in nothing but in sitting and shivering by the fire.
eng_Latn as the poor are never without that
eng_Latn I hain't ever done you no harm.
eng_Latn there have been some who have suffered more than I have
eng_Latn I am a selfish girl!
eng_Latn but I would have nothing to do with it.
eng_Latn Oh. Just a thing. An anything thing. I was just wondering.
eng_Latn he was a university man, and had been a professor of philosophy
eng_Latn for the train had halted only a few feet beyond where he stood
eng_Latn by adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had
eng_Latn I'd had more happiness than most people ever experienced.
eng_Latn then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache.
eng_Latn if you had one.
eng_Latn but I thought others were fairly dull.
eng_Latn it was like a change below the surface of water which remains smooth.
eng_Latn but I was club champion back in '76 and again in '79, and still pretty good in '86.
eng_Latn his hand, which was always on the butt of the pistol
eng_Latn only a little green showing through the film of dust.
eng_Latn if you are in a position to pay the indemnity stated in the contract.
eng_Latn they have no home, no corner of the earth wherein to house their memories
eng_Latn but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything.
eng_Latn the day had grown dark very suddenly, and now there was thick thunder and the sound of rain had swelled.
eng_Latn I glanced over my shoulder
eng_Latn I never doubted some woman might be found
eng_Latn seemed the very breath of the strident multi coloured and barbaric population.
eng_Latn because shehad said three or four times that if I didn't she would kill her self.
eng_Latn as though that were a disturbing fact.
eng_Latn which was indeed a prodigious leap.
eng_Latn I isn't using wands
eng_Latn woman smiled at the intensity of the handsome young boy.
eng_Latn who of his own free will hath exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee?
eng_Latn I'm finding it hard to concentrate.
eng_Latn I was disappointed when she reached her car before she had to pass me.
eng_Latn I have a throbbing headache, and I feel on the verge of tears.
eng_Latn took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter
eng_Latn then striving again to get loose.
eng_Latn he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs.
eng_Latn seems to me so like him spiritually
eng_Latn shooting up to the height of about two hundred yards.
eng_Latn the well gnawed bones of two or three fowls.
eng_Latn I should have been continually at fault.
eng_Latn by my beard but the grey is a good one.
eng_Latn not a waffle or zigzag pattern but groups of circles and lines
eng_Latn a regular meeting.
eng_Latn I took my hat which I held under my arm out of good manners, and waving it over my head
eng_Latn I don't know, I told him honestly.
eng_Latn he happened to have a wife who was musical and altogether worth calling upon.
eng_Latn some of it had gone the wrong way.
eng_Latn now you should blush to allude to it.
eng_Latn I had the honour to dine with the governor
eng_Latn I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet
eng_Latn I need to take it's photograph, butso far ... not a salty sniff of it.
eng_Latn no barrier to keep back chaos.
eng_Latn forbade me to tell the truth.
eng_Latn I thought perhaps you didn't want to be spoken to.
eng_Latn So have I.
eng_Latn then he too left.
eng_Latn but this time she took proper precautions, for she had no intention of ever getting pregnant again.
eng_Latn something carved into one of the support beams
eng_Latn I turned back and started loping slowly toward the west.
eng_Latn on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his heart.
eng_Latn I have two lists of paintings here.
eng_Latn she is so worn away.
eng_Latn now that I had found the boat
eng_Latn I took advantage of the fire to cook them.
eng_Latn I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak, for inviting that lady and her daughter
eng_Latn I think I can see a Yeti!
eng_Latn so I didn't say anything.
eng_Latn I seen it all happen again.
eng_Latn back to your post to eat it,
eng_Latn but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.
eng_Latn last night he had awakened briefly
eng_Latn four persons and my spouse ill.
eng_Latn I don't know if I tipped him for being very well or for being on duty.
eng_Latn I haven't enough to pay for a passport!
eng_Latn hauled through the panel by something on the other side.
eng_Latn as though he had come this moment , straight out of some green meadow at the other side of the world.
eng_Latn I'll go to town and see how things are.
eng_Latn Like what Dog?
eng_Latn but it could have led to very serious consequences.
eng_Latn under that sky there, every day.
eng_Latn so you actually put this piece of court plaister by for his sake!
eng_Latn which would be a perfect godsend to his enemies for calumny and attacks on his high position in society.
eng_Latn he never was a wild man, but he got dangerous after he lost her.
eng_Latn reduced to such shifts!
eng_Latn finally, only one skrewt was left.
eng_Latn my intention isthat she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives.
eng_Latn she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her heart
eng_Latn no chance to lie down or stretch out.
eng_Latn supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that means
eng_Latn Naughty Arne Saknussemm.
eng_Latn until the sun was well up
eng_Latn I loved only her.
eng_Latn whom he had met by the way
eng_Latn tried to remember the dream he had been having.
eng_Latn but he feared that such a late adhesion would earn but scant gratitude from the victors.
eng_Latn recently occupied and temporarily used.
eng_Latn pushed away the watering pot, and turned her flushed face towards him.
eng_Latn I knowit takes some getting used to.
eng_Latn you shall not leave me in that temper.
eng_Latn a wordless ongoing agreement.
eng_Latn I know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.
eng_Latn then folded them all up again carefully.
eng_Latn dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.
eng_Latn so that you will not collect for this squandering in the other life.
eng_Latn yet keep watch on the light side.
eng_Latn he met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead
eng_Latn I have argued it myself.
eng_Latn I wasn't embarrassed.
eng_Latn I was excited by the encounter, and my fancy worked busily while I sought to concentrate myself on the game I was playing.
eng_Latn I remember a still life of oranges on a plate
eng_Latn then suddenly fell back on her pillow
eng_Latn I know you've been physically faithful to me.
eng_Latn but remember that you are not to strike till I give the signal.
eng_Latn even if the man in question had been married to her for over four years.
eng_Latn in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided
eng_Latn yet lowering his voice in order to give the dreadful subject its proper medium of obscurity
eng_Latn but controlled himself and closed the door softly behind him.
eng_Latn leaning over her at once began to purr.
eng_Latn but directly he was alone on the mound under the oak tree
eng_Latn which would not last a year for a man of his habits.
eng_Latn hammered nails into him and crucified him, and afterwards
eng_Latn we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises.
eng_Latn he said vaguely.
eng_Latn she cut it off with one stroke.
eng_Latn I'd thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me, even in joke!
eng_Latn I lose my temper on the slightest provocation, flare up, and then it's all over.
eng_Latn I passed through, and I came out again alive!
eng_Latn sunrise to sunset.
eng_Latn Hey, who?
eng_Latn occurred a few days before that date.
eng_Latn but the boat I was in, having some start
eng_Latn Hmm. You know what I think?
eng_Latn with such a haughty and dignified accent
eng_Latn I dare not come again.
eng_Latn we walked up and down, for a minute or two, in silence.
eng_Latn doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry
eng_Latn took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.
eng_Latn feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way
eng_Latn but because it was an unbearable burden
eng_Latn a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front
eng_Latn he'd let out an audible gasp.
eng_Latn let's have a look.
eng_Latn see if there wasanything wrong in his understanding of it.
eng_Latn if no other reason will induce you
eng_Latn just as he fetched you another awful clip
eng_Latn but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye cannot see.
eng_Latn running a hand down it until he caught just the ends of it between his fingers.
eng_Latn but the man with the black camera jumped up and cleared his throat.
eng_Latn he said and his face went suddenly quiet and somber.
eng_Latn here came by a pair of tight scarlet trousers
eng_Latn then put him back in the wild!
eng_Latn but he had not time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.
eng_Latn That s not a pepperoni pizza Dog! It's a picture of you. Look, there s your eyes. And that s your nose.
eng_Latn that I should be allowed a l l little chuckle all to myself now.
eng_Latn who jumped in with his riding cane and settled it.
eng_Latn Oh, that s not much help.
eng_Latn I was sent down south to a hospital
eng_Latn it's the same I saw this morning,' he returned.
eng_Latn I think maybe you forgot your medication today mental boy
eng_Latn watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
eng_Latn I didn't hear the rising bell this morning
eng_Latn the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room
eng_Latn but when she entered his figure was gone.
eng_Latn to yield was out of the question.
eng_Latn I rub my face confusedly.
eng_Latn lead to some faint desire on her part to contact him again at some time or other.
eng_Latn I'll tap her loose.
eng_Latn when they saw he was at leisure
eng_Latn patiently waiting for the boys to go home to supper.
eng_Latn I'll be so good to her.
eng_Latn after he has grown rich he will give him his soul
eng_Latn but directly he saw himself noticed, he approached quietly and put his elbow over the door of the landau.
eng_Latn for in that lies all the hope and faith of the saints.
eng_Latn Perhaps we dogs can teach you somenew tricks.
eng_Latn We can t get them to stop!
eng_Latn found myself just in the middle up to my knees.
eng_Latn he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly
eng_Latn money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected.
eng_Latn I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me
eng_Latn by adjusting the annual and diurnal motions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with all accidental turnings of the wind.
eng_Latn are such that they fill me with admiration
eng_Latn are not thereby annulled in their character of determining antecedents.
eng_Latn A treasure chest!
eng_Latn took it into his head that this was a case of adventure
eng_Latn with many more.
eng_Latn he had no opportunity to communicate with her.
eng_Latn except that he had never seen the prisoner on any other occasion
eng_Latn Two salty sea dogs, eh? Say Arrr.
eng_Latn who was less corpulent than his father
eng_Latn holding it erect in the air
eng_Latn it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft, and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor.
eng_Latn a bad bout perhaps every five months or so.
eng_Latn you are beating on my brain
eng_Latn I never particularly desired to avenge myself even
eng_Latn with free access to our royal person, and other marks of our favour.
eng_Latn but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied both with her and with himself.
eng_Latn she's off hunting at the moment.
eng_Latn it was like a continual seduction.
eng_Latn I'd like to see her get around THIS with her rubbage about superstition.
eng_Latn but his thoughts were elsewhere at this particular season of the year, too of all times.
eng_Latn it filled my vision and overwhelmed my mind.
eng_Latn so sunk had she been in thought that she had seen nothing for several days
eng_Latn as if to plunge it into her.
eng_Latn now you owe me five.
eng_Latn in that case allow me to tell you of your brother's highly chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he did give expression to it at the time.
eng_Latn all of them, cheap and new.
eng_Latn Dog! Look what I just found slithering up the wall of my den!
eng_Latn I have even informed him of a circumstance
eng_Latn it will bring bad luck.
eng_Latn which they slurped happily
eng_Latn as this knotty point is still unsettled, and as we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can help it, I think we had better take a little breathing time.
eng_Latn unless he has some one woman to love him dearly.
eng_Latn she had not given a thought to the fact that the price she was paying for the safety of home was permanent exile from it.
eng_Latn that if he complained of his situation
eng_Latn but they don't seem to have built it yet, do they?
eng_Latn I bet they didn't!
eng_Latn if thou wert not my full niece, being daughter of my own sister
eng_Latn fifteen were counted before the library door again opened.
eng_Latn wish he hadn't seen that.
eng_Latn because for many years she had erased him from her life
eng_Latn I'm going to go and ask the driver what's going on
eng_Latn his blue eyes very kind
eng_Latn clutched his arm fearfully.
eng_Latn poked a few wisps back inside the tube with a match end, struck the match and lit up.
eng_Latn that was what had wakened her.
eng_Latn old woman looked at the other side of the road and saw that it was lined with them
eng_Latn I did it with my fingers in one minute.
eng_Latn he walked home, and it was early morning when he arrived.
eng_Latn that it was merely a temporary painful ordeal which would pass over.
eng_Latn That s very good Pug. I do enjoy apepperoni pizza.
eng_Latn then he busted into tears, and so did everybody.
eng_Latn I doubted my father and renounced his name.
eng_Latn I stole in on tiptoe.
eng_Latn I saw what he meant, and for a moment the room swam around me.
eng_Latn he stopped the third division
eng_Latn he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night
eng_Latn he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.
eng_Latn in the ardour of this discovery
eng_Latn caused him to decide that he might be wrong.
eng_Latn that he had means
eng_Latn I knocked at your door but had no answer
eng_Latn I hope Snarks aren’t scary.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug.
eng_Latn Actually, I rather like them.
eng_Latn moving a few steps away from his suite, which waited respectfully
eng_Latn in half an hour she spied me.
eng_Latn answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well.
eng_Latn his small and insecure world tottering.
eng_Latn I was a fool not to expect something like this.
eng_Latn but that her technical as well as emotional plea had failed
eng_Latn delicately frazzled and beautiful as usual.
eng_Latn I can blow out mine.
eng_Latn but she put the folded sheets in her dressing table without reading them
eng_Latn finally, only one skrewt was left.
eng_Latn I feel cross, but not very, that frivolous young man, would you believe it, seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me.
eng_Latn they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two man tents.
eng_Latn was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.
eng_Latn Shall we draw together?
eng_Latn I can lie down under them trees an' sleep for a thousan' years if I want to.
eng_Latn seeing that there was nothing against me
eng_Latn What are they racketing about?
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn I'm tired of sitting at home and I'm not going to do it any longer.
eng_Latn he said there'd be a lot more comtn'.
eng_Latn with his flambeau bearer going on before
eng_Latn he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity.
eng_Latn half hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles.
eng_Latn which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
eng_Latn it probably smelled good to everyone else.
eng_Latn how different it was from shearing.
eng_Latn he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if dropping a poisonous spider.
eng_Latn I asked you as soon as I came into the room
eng_Latn but remember
eng_Latn but not once did he look around or take his eyes from her.
eng_Latn so that the thought of losing her was really terrible to him
eng_Latn she did not think of tears at first
eng_Latn to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again.
eng_Latn shortly entered one on the same plan, but superior in length and breadth.
eng_Latn I got up and walked into the court to seek him.
eng_Latn I pushed the door open
eng_Latn that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him
eng_Latn sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town?
eng_Latn And a one two, one two threefour...
eng_Latn reduced to such shifts!
eng_Latn come and see.
eng_Latn so he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven
eng_Latn she and I were alone.
eng_Latn but was certain that it would be repeated at any moment.
eng_Latn unless she were extremely and foolishly indulgent.
eng_Latn but all through the house
eng_Latn I was sorry, I kissed her as she was going.
eng_Latn Someone who tells me which way togo so I'm not beaten by my rotten rival.
eng_Latn Is it covered in fur?
eng_Latn glanced at his watch.
eng_Latn he would have found some money.
eng_Latn highly uncertain as to whether she would prove of service here or anywhere.
eng_Latn I'd merely been making a pretext to come into the shop.
eng_Latn more contentious and bitter than at any time ever between them.
eng_Latn it cannot be more
eng_Latn the first words I learnt, were to express my desire
eng_Latn until I got my eye above the window sill
eng_Latn it zoomed out of the window and out of sight.
eng_Latn who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure.
eng_Latn in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right.
eng_Latn almost digging his nails into his breast
eng_Latn with grave repentance, and then began to giggle again
eng_Latn it's not everybody who has a house in which to come into the world
eng_Latn pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table.
eng_Latn he was standing
eng_Latn I call it improper pride to let fools' notions hinder you from doing a good action.
eng_Latn Thank goodness you re here! Please hurry!
eng_Latn she, the poorest of the poor, was unable to bring his body home.
eng_Latn I was seized with a sudden desire to laugh, to cry, to do both
eng_Latn or would receive him with a warm heart.
eng_Latn but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering.
eng_Latn so they stopped right before me
eng_Latn struck at its straining head and slashed at its moving feet.
eng_Latn I broke one glass and fouled the tap
eng_Latn I have another business deal to attend to.
eng_Latn about the old days.
eng_Latn as coffee led to a drawing room in which to drink it
eng_Latn now, let me talk to you of something else.
eng_Latn trying to disguise the agitation of her voice and the flush of her face
eng_Latn even if he does have to wear false teeth.
eng_Latn so they had to be content with sharing power in bed.
eng_Latn but the grade here was very steep and smooth.
eng_Latn Was she like this the last time you read her?
eng_Latn he had suddenly felt uneasy.
eng_Latn that he was obliged to behave as if nothing had annoyed him.
eng_Latn you're right, tipsy spirit you're right!
eng_Latn but he saw nothing except the ears and neck of his own mare, the ground racing to meet him,
eng_Latn I ask the court to instruct the witness that he need not answer such a question
eng_Latn on his last visit this had struck him
eng_Latn he said, evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his
eng_Latn Hurray. Well Done
eng_Latn if ye're feared o' muckying yer grand silk cloes, spread yer hankerchir o' t' top on't.
eng_Latn he declared he had no ear for this appeal.
eng_Latn instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done
eng_Latn handed over the sheets of paper, folded small.
eng_Latn the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble.
eng_Latn Job done, Dog.
eng_Latn This is a book about Enid Brighton,who wrote dozens of thrilling stories.
eng_Latn took him by the hand, and spoke to him.
eng_Latn but see no reflection again.
eng_Latn scratched and bruised but otherwise unharmed.
eng_Latn so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dollars a month.
eng_Latn until the crypt in the family mausoleum was sealed.
eng_Latn but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news.
eng_Latn supplied with all her needs, including crew.
eng_Latn so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book.
eng_Latn as wide awake as if he had never slept.
eng_Latn she had the delicious pleasure of vengeance fulfilled.
eng_Latn that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink
eng_Latn I feel so sure of it that I want to give you a little advice.
eng_Latn it was a long time.
eng_Latn but this is all so sudden that I do not know what to say.
eng_Latn I knew it, I could read it 'SUCCESS!
eng_Latn and with that he drove on andleft the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log!
eng_Latn I cranked up the car and got in.
eng_Latn I am The Amazing Pugdini!
eng_Latn I ran some risk for you, you see.
eng_Latn in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.
eng_Latn Treasury island!
eng_Latn but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter
eng_Latn I choked as soon as I could breathe.
eng_Latn I trembled, and turned white.
eng_Latn lit a cigarette, smoked it, and crushed the end on the floor.
eng_Latn Oh Woe. Oh woe.
eng_Latn I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.
eng_Latn I spoke as deliberately as I could.
eng_Latn because he was already carrying something.
eng_Latn when I closed them
eng_Latn I started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.
eng_Latn that he followed and watched you the whole time
eng_Latn but as her rage broke over them.
eng_Latn but here too was the same intolerable silence.
eng_Latn they were all quiet until the lay sister left the room.
eng_Latn Who has done all this wonderfulwork?
eng_Latn let alone a cake
eng_Latn but flat and inadequate in comparison to the real thing.
eng_Latn leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag
eng_Latn not withsufficient force really to injure her, he thought at the time.
eng_Latn he was beside her.
eng_Latn Because books are much better homesfor thoughts and ideas Pug.
eng_Latn sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town?
eng_Latn remember how strong we are in our happiness
eng_Latn so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were tamed upon him, turned to them.
eng_Latn I paced quietly in front of the house.
eng_Latn that he should arrive after all was over.
eng_Latn he considered that it could and should have been defended
eng_Latn I advanced forward
eng_Latn unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him.
eng_Latn I wish your heart were independent.
eng_Latn I shall have something of the greatest importance to communicate to you
eng_Latn I estimate that it requires one more minute.
eng_Latn I bought three anticipating your less than enthusiastic reaction
eng_Latn I made a concerted effort to focus.
eng_Latn I shouldn't think it's worth anything.
eng_Latn what a disgrace upon the house!
eng_Latn quaked again under the inspiration of this remark
eng_Latn whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him
eng_Latn a little noise, very different from that which was causing him so much fear.
eng_Latn bursting at the same time into a flood of tears
eng_Latn I grimaced, throwing myself back in the seat.
eng_Latn should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels
eng_Latn he asked him to stay to dinner.
eng_Latn The bookshop mice really do like a game of hide and squeak. And Dog? Dog Loves Books.
eng_Latn he confined him indoors throughout the whole of the winter, nearly without intermission.
eng_Latn I'm running a fever.
eng_Latn Shuttle craft ready for journey to Earth.
eng_Latn I will in a few words show you the real state of the case.
eng_Latn I darted back into the morning room again, just in time.
eng_Latn so, as you value his existence, let me get at him!
eng_Latn why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy at last
eng_Latn let the daughter have free advent
eng_Latn when she sets herself to press a point
eng_Latn I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep, and we both went up stairs.
eng_Latn I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there
eng_Latn one a beautiful creature of nineteen
eng_Latn for if thou wilt report them to me as they were
eng_Latn There is a hole in the sky that goes straight to your world.
eng_Latn to yield themselves to him in any way that he might dictate.
eng_Latn I forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound.
eng_Latn retired, leaving the door open, that I might avail myself of that permission.
eng_Latn the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major
eng_Latn we cannot be damper, or colder, in the rain than we are here.
eng_Latn has it not been agreed that I should take you with me
eng_Latn he casting back a look that cut my heart she obeyed.
eng_Latn which show from afar that it is plainly madness to attempt them.
eng_Latn the young men self consciously clutching their hats
eng_Latn the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb
eng_Latn then decided that there was but one thing to do lay the bundle aside
eng_Latn Just this very mornin .
eng_Latn when I saw a figure, or large bush, or at least something black ahead of me.
eng_Latn for those who seek adventures don't always find good ones.
eng_Latn to confront her, to argue with her, to cry with her in rage at the loss of paradise
eng_Latn Oh no. They were also the first to make paper, silk, umbrellas, tea and gunpowder.
eng_Latn he had boarded the night mail with two minutes to spare.
eng_Latn anyone beating him at anything
eng_Latn took her hand again.
eng_Latn In Paris, if you have no money, youmust buy things with Art! Here is your blue paint.
eng_Latn each possessed of the anlage of movement.
eng_Latn he was horribly shaken
eng_Latn then words came back to him, and he broke out into a flood of abuse.
eng_Latn that I could save and pay it thatway, maybe.
eng_Latn that the tune comes of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune
eng_Latn forced to fly from the places of their birth on account of their poverty or their crimes.
eng_Latn there were two points on which she was not quite easy.
eng_Latn talk a little business with old friends
eng_Latn We re in training for the cup you know.
eng_Latn I can make a cloud.
eng_Latn I will do it yet.
eng_Latn as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand.
eng_Latn in a great fright gave him a very confused account of what he had seen.
eng_Latn but there was no reason
eng_Latn it won't be borne!
eng_Latn so it was weakness not to enforce the second.
eng_Latn he took my hand in his large firm grasp.
eng_Latn until eventually I became so irritated that I decided to play the boor.
eng_Latn she had the appearance of nolonger daring to breathe.
eng_Latn moving a few steps away from his suite, which waited respectfully
eng_Latn the sea being full in my view
eng_Latn I can't possibly keep them.
eng_Latn I've already ruined this, he whispered.
eng_Latn I am determined to show them the difference.
eng_Latn the father has mourned sufficiently
eng_Latn I stepped in there before going up to the hall.
eng_Latn but that's just the way I feel right now.
eng_Latn and then went away and immediately did the murder.
eng_Latn I don't like to lie
eng_Latn Dog. What exactly IS a Snark ?
eng_Latn above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.
eng_Latn had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.
eng_Latn while I suppose that interest in the common weal is bound to exist in every man of a certain degree of advancement.
eng_Latn I know that the longer he has lived with you the loftier you have been in his eyes.
eng_Latn the daughter who was born four months after their return
eng_Latn I rushed you into it.
eng_Latn looking at him with great complacency from head to foot
eng_Latn it appears that the sum of them is 666
eng_Latn for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.
eng_Latn so intent was she upon the money the mill would bring in.
eng_Latn touched the glass with it
eng_Latn one of the enemy actually fell
eng_Latn the mirror with necklaces strung over the side
eng_Latn your sister thinks so as well as I.
eng_Latn bound to its place with the rope.
eng_Latn assuring them that the judge was his brother.
eng_Latn took a little of the excitement out of me.
eng_Latn only one or two slices had been cut from it.
eng_Latn had succeeded in making him more or less than man.
eng_Latn the fact that success isn't a guarantee
eng_Latn Er... would you read it to me?
eng_Latn he then came and brought his chair to the other side of my table, leaning over it
eng_Latn if you'll let me b'long to the gang
eng_Latn they had come for their tools.
eng_Latn I wasn't going to stand around arguing with the wretch.
eng_Latn a launch sped out, and three hours later returned.
eng_Latn To the wheelie-ladder, Dog?
eng_Latn on my account!
eng_Latn the sole chance for the natural heir is to allow him an opportunity of creating some interest in the creditor's heart, that he may be inclined to deal leniently towards him.
eng_Latn I made his honour my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he was pleased to conceive of me
eng_Latn or you will always be disappointed.
eng_Latn for I'm half bewildered.
eng_Latn I ll do better than that, I ll take you there myself.
eng_Latn when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm.
eng_Latn money is as plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard
eng_Latn I rolled over and wrenched myself into a sitting position.
eng_Latn How did cheese get into our dog biscuit recipe?
eng_Latn had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away
eng_Latn hand raised in the signal that everything was fine
eng_Latn if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise
eng_Latn I don't know what's the matter with you.
eng_Latn hung low over the field of battle on the horizon.
eng_Latn he rushed into the street
eng_Latn I'm committed to do the right thing hereI'm not joining any other coven.
eng_Latn the boys were on the loose and eager to commence their allotted chores around the house and garden.
eng_Latn but on moving towards the whist tables
eng_Latn I was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest timber trees, for oars and masts
eng_Latn went to draw the curtains at his window.
eng_Latn I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it
eng_Latn power these two uprooted existences, differing in age, alike in sorrow.
eng_Latn I shouldn't think it's worth anything.
eng_Latn these moments were but presentiments, as it were, of the one final second
eng_Latn I, too, have a talent for languages.
eng_Latn We must hurry Dog and Pug, it snearly tea time. What do you want me to do?
eng_Latn starved at that, by the powers!
eng_Latn but the other two didn't even look back.
eng_Latn Well, there was a place once...when I was a puppy.
eng_Latn farther than the common answer, that different nations had different customs.
eng_Latn Do not worry Grace. We can stilllight his way with our trusty head torches!
eng_Latn who for armour wears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which
eng_Latn the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke
eng_Latn I have to try to win them round.
eng_Latn suddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room.
eng_Latn he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question.
eng_Latn plunking a large copper basin in front of him.
eng_Latn as well as his high blood relations with his family
eng_Latn but with obvious errors that from every point of view are inexcusable?
eng_Latn indeed, as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier part
eng_Latn I have argued it myself.
eng_Latn you must acknowledge that I am making up for lost time
eng_Latn there was the same lean porter standing at the gate
eng_Latn the fragments stimulated his imagination and made him constructive.
eng_Latn she should see any wide opening where she followed him.
eng_Latn they whispered to one another
eng_Latn a head was put out at the window
eng_Latn he will not be wanted any more.
eng_Latn if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.
eng_Latn hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, and pushed himself forward.
eng_Latn but as you say enchanters persecute you
eng_Latn maybe what seems to us an hour would seem three days and nights there.
eng_Latn he came to fetch his spade, that he had forgotten.
eng_Latn so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards.
eng_Latn so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified
eng_Latn which because of the visitors this morning was unusually late
eng_Latn I don't want to hear it
eng_Latn I was the third of five sons.
eng_Latn forgive me for the deceit I have practised on you!
eng_Latn if we was to squeak
eng_Latn a very poor rate of multiplication when the field is a young gentleman's infinite soul, with all the numerals at command.
eng_Latn the results have, I fear, been negative.
eng_Latn not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on which to land conveniently.
eng_Latn or until she is out of this thing, but thatit can't be helped.
eng_Latn at least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire.
eng_Latn Perhaps you have another book inthe shop that can help?
eng_Latn after dinner I'll come back
eng_Latn suddenly the elevator seemed no more than telephone booth size, then coffin size.
eng_Latn to enjoy excellent health herself.
eng_Latn as though he was making an effort to be civil to the photographer
eng_Latn With these we will hoodwink thatwolf!
eng_Latn then lowered for the charge.
eng_Latn I dab the eye gel on my eyes and force myself to breathe deeply until I'm completely calm again.
eng_Latn you may lay to that!
eng_Latn I think Pug has found a scent.
eng_Latn I lost sixty thoosand of ma acres, and half ma wee sheep.
eng_Latn there's no earthly reason why she should be present at all.
eng_Latn he couldn't stand a decent respectable life in a little country town
eng_Latn they produced no more effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.
eng_Latn I thought of my father's grave in the churchyard, by our house
eng_Latn he had everything to make a good writer but talent.
eng_Latn I doubt it.
eng_Latn Shall we draw together?
eng_Latn I looked round
eng_Latn then spreading them on the table
eng_Latn but now it did not strike him so.
eng_Latn for those who seek adventures don't always find good ones.
eng_Latn I'll open the other side of my heart to you.
eng_Latn Once upon a time there was a river, and over that river there was a bridge
eng_Latn even if they do carry odours about with them
eng_Latn but his cousin put on as sad a countenance as himself, and returned to her father.
eng_Latn it is too warm to hang about your friends.
eng_Latn his hand clenched on his wand.
eng_Latn subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws
eng_Latn Act like a carrot.
eng_Latn either now or an hour hence.
eng_Latn O night with hue so black! O night, alack, alack, alack, alack, alack! I see a voice. (Thisbe) My Pyramus! (Pyramus) My Thisbe (Thisbe) Where is my Pyramus? (Lion) Roar! (Thisbe) Oh, a lion (Lion) Roar! (Thisbe) Oh. Oh a aaaagh
eng_Latn for they had not yet the heart to look further back.
eng_Latn never quite going under completely
eng_Latn I did not positively say so.
eng_Latn with his solitary knee fixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat
eng_Latn the flagship had been among the first to sink
eng_Latn even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it plain.
eng_Latn Ahoy there boys!
eng_Latn but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.
eng_Latn It's beautiful!
eng_Latn but the food was good, and there was good wine
eng_Latn he was deadly cold.
eng_Latn so as to make them happy.
eng_Latn I'll have to be going now, though,
eng_Latn at last he asked him for five pounds.
eng_Latn telling him somehow that this was his brother
eng_Latn Five thousand years before you were born.
eng_Latn I should like to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I haven't the time.
eng_Latn Why is this sound really very cool indeed?
eng_Latn as people usually are who are nearly tired to death.
eng_Latn the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too
eng_Latn she couldn't comb them out.
eng_Latn he attempted to rise, but she seized his hair, and kept him down.
eng_Latn where he had been educated, and had been in the diplomatic service.
eng_Latn left him there alone.
eng_Latn hurried up to the house top.
eng_Latn but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.
eng_Latn was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.
eng_Latn tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy's utmost acuteness.
eng_Latn to shut himself up alone and put all his affairs into definite shape.
eng_Latn but humbly desired his highness to excuse me for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace.
eng_Latn Oh. Where has it gone?
eng_Latn took off her dress, and began arranging her thin hair for the night, she had a great sense of relief.
eng_Latn it is a whole solar system on the march.
eng_Latn that is why you, in your turn, are to die
eng_Latn Can you ever forgive me?
eng_Latn he felt his pettiness, and many a time he wept.
eng_Latn I have been young, you will be old.
eng_Latn she dropped to the cushioned seat with a little cry.
eng_Latn but he would have taken _in petto_ the first dictator who came along and swept away the red spectre.
eng_Latn in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.
eng_Latn the sun still low
eng_Latn This is a story about someone whowanted to be remembered.
eng_Latn Well, Pug looks dependable... andloyal... and very VERY brave.
eng_Latn striking his head against a stone
eng_Latn I am sure I shall not be able to sleep.
eng_Latn put up in the drawing room.
eng_Latn that she was himself.
eng_Latn by this means he rose higher in their estimation.
eng_Latn had remained, through all its travails, a committed supporter.
eng_Latn ready to giggle with relief.
eng_Latn I'm sure it is perfectly safe...asmy friend Pug will demonstrate.
eng_Latn It was all dark. And foresty!
eng_Latn as soon as he felt himself baptized again.
eng_Latn her ruffled skirt raised to keep it from dragging on the floor.
eng_Latn went down with her father, and sat opposite to him at table.
eng_Latn she looked up at the change in her mothers voice.
eng_Latn I am responsible for his fever.
eng_Latn with this mere attempt I shall rest satisfied
eng_Latn they say he's half dead.
eng_Latn it's no use now.
eng_Latn but I strongly advise you to pack him off tomorrow.
eng_Latn had been chiefly his own teacher
eng_Latn coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern
eng_Latn Backwards... Backwards...
eng_Latn I deliberately redirected my thoughts in order to control my emotions.
eng_Latn but there were a dozen different accounts of how he had achieved his vast fortune, some of them not flattering.
eng_Latn unless some one helped him.
eng_Latn already getting ready to change back again.
eng_Latn but through a hollow iron tube full of blood, which he had adroitly fixed at the place
eng_Latn ER...HELLO DORIS.
eng_Latn And more.
eng_Latn with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket
eng_Latn because it puts you in danger of getting bitten
eng_Latn What a wonderful idea Pug!
eng_Latn because you were so much prettier and had so many beaux.
eng_Latn the irony of it was that the rain had brought a dank chill into the air
eng_Latn her jaw dropping as she looked after the carriage with passionate curiosity.
eng_Latn I lurched away from him, my hand tight over my mouth.
eng_Latn An alien invasion?
eng_Latn I will ask what is the matter, I thought
eng_Latn but next day, when he went up to the examination buildings to see the result posted on the door, he was astounded not to find his number among those who had satisfied the examiners.
eng_Latn I can't make you that strong a fighter in a few weeks.
eng_Latn NOW are you satisfied?
eng_Latn confident in the character and behaviour of the girl who never was born.
eng_Latn as he afterwards told me
eng_Latn gripped the wheel so tightly
eng_Latn why we'll fight the ship.
eng_Latn I tought to take a course to be a fingerprint expert.
eng_Latn but it was all confusion.
eng_Latn I can draw anything!
eng_Latn an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men
eng_Latn with fair hair, rather pretty, with wonderful blue eyes.
eng_Latn they had stopped for lunch and heard weak cries coming from the south side of town.
eng_Latn he fell into bed, utterly exhausted, and slept.
eng_Latn I have got fifteen louis d'or in my possession, although I began with fifteen gulden.
eng_Latn after consulting awhile with the inn keeper
eng_Latn the black serpent foundered.
eng_Latn but he felt certain he was not drunk
eng_Latn seal their lids shut so they cant possibly leak or slip off.
eng_Latn in spite of being deprived of the country life to which
eng_Latn but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth.
eng_Latn by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn
eng_Latn he had been continuously under its influence, but only now found full satisfaction for it.
eng_Latn I can't talk business with you if you're going on that way.
eng_Latn These dog biscuits taste of Fetch!
eng_Latn jumping, ducking, and breaking through
eng_Latn He s implausible... impossible... incredible.
eng_Latn now lay in agony
eng_Latn I'm very sorry Dog.
eng_Latn How did you do that Pug?
eng_Latn which took a surprisingly short time.
eng_Latn perhaps I had better go to bed.
eng_Latn This is a yellow page three.
eng_Latn in the shade of willows growing close to a stream
eng_Latn or he may in an unlucky hour hear of it, be angry, and withdraw his favor.
eng_Latn to what headsman each of them belonged.
eng_Latn she suspected and feared that this defendantwould fail her.
eng_Latn which from an humble and lowly shepherd, its founder
eng_Latn cried and then laughed unnaturally.
eng_Latn their histories, if indeed they were not burned
eng_Latn but one can't help complaining sometimes.
eng_Latn Oh, I think I upset him!
eng_Latn but made no sign.
eng_Latn even other monsters didn't want to name it.
eng_Latn of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past
eng_Latn papa is a baron, and we must keep up appearances.
eng_Latn I called for time out!
eng_Latn I felt the little tears as the thorns cut into my skin, but I ignored them.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! Let's read a book about the hottest place in the world. They ll know how to keep cool there. To the wheely ladder Dog.
eng_Latn then he looked again through the keyhole.
eng_Latn that I feel it almost repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation
eng_Latn the desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source, the body.
eng_Latn wiped his hot face and hands.
eng_Latn he liked continuity
eng_Latn taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.
eng_Latn who encircled the lady who had before fainted
eng_Latn but of late my worrys become an obsession.
eng_Latn however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several passages.
eng_Latn It would help if you were a bit taller, Dave.
eng_Latn probably he had just had a beating.
eng_Latn as I sat there huddled on the floor.
eng_Latn who will yield up his life on this barren strand if thou dost leave him.
eng_Latn for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly
eng_Latn their respective dreams without injury to each other.
eng_Latn you children have broken my heart between you.
eng_Latn like a shiver running down his spine.
eng_Latn let coherent thought gradually return.
eng_Latn looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows
eng_Latn that he had scarcely time to collect his wits well, yousee I wasn't absolutely sure.
eng_Latn A round table? (think) Easy peasy! Round-inious Tab-linious!
eng_Latn if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
eng_Latn let us go and look for some place to shelter ourselves in to night.
eng_Latn argued in the defence of it
eng_Latn for we must make haste to the place where we are to feed them.
eng_Latn he heard the gate clash again, and all was quiet.
eng_Latn as though there were something in this impression that demanded his special attention.
eng_Latn but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight.
eng_Latn knowing your admirable tenacity
eng_Latn Acorns from the oak tree Pug.
eng_Latn made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor
eng_Latn a golden afternoon
eng_Latn yielding in time a grateful harvest of good.
eng_Latn if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship.
eng_Latn the purpose being to gain intelligence about what's really going on over there
eng_Latn I'm afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time,
eng_Latn took up her knitting.
eng_Latn leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.
eng_Latn for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
eng_Latn how much a guy can remember.
eng_Latn like the transparent, half jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth
eng_Latn Hours!
eng_Latn the thirst of agormandizer with the discretion of a judge.
eng_Latn which by some mistake
eng_Latn Hopping mad Max!
eng_Latn as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the street on a bright sunny day.
eng_Latn but I shall refuse.
eng_Latn Ah, that was what that was.
eng_Latn for now he had his mother all to himself.
eng_Latn that the rude peasants here don't wish to let the mistress leave the estate
eng_Latn crowded around the huge, oak front door.
eng_Latn my master had not quitted his apartment, and remained ignorant of our prolonged absence.
eng_Latn then she looked at him with a new understanding and some amazement.
eng_Latn had been allowed to exist, was a miracle.
eng_Latn I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him.
eng_Latn it seemed to him that he had not taken the affair seriously enough.
eng_Latn the other's that cub that
eng_Latn I want your help in something urgent.
eng_Latn that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!
eng_Latn he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first.
eng_Latn but it didn't stir, and I knew it was dead.
eng_Latn taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
eng_Latn I want you to drive to the mill with me.
eng_Latn always in secret
eng_Latn that gate stopped the flow of the excitement.
eng_Latn half concealed in this queer tenement
eng_Latn so that there was no knowing to which to reply.
eng_Latn but as he moved faster, so did his quarry.
eng_Latn I could earn a dollar and a half a day, common labor
eng_Latn I went in and the door closed behind me.
eng_Latn he walked several miles to return a couple of pennies that he had overcharged a woman.
eng_Latn nobody else in the history of the world has been able to compel an object to move without touching it or blowing on it or using any outside help at all.
eng_Latn the scared, bad part of all of us.
eng_Latn I could let him go, but it's the principle of the thing.
eng_Latn I wish he hadn't.
eng_Latn yet not without a little of outwardly suppressed surprise when she saw the name.
eng_Latn but the house was at least fifty paces away.
eng_Latn I was wrong.
eng_Latn the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected.
eng_Latn I could imagine that maybe I would be able to see it that way, too, in a few years.
eng_Latn That wasn t very nice Tina.
eng_Latn I can t wait to meet the hero whois going to ask Dog the Wise and Pug the Pointy to join them on their quest.
eng_Latn I sat down and waited
eng_Latn resuming the letter.
eng_Latn he had never seen anything so dazzling as the quality of her skin
eng_Latn then dropped his headquickly.
eng_Latn although the two facts were quite unconnected.
eng_Latn he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered
eng_Latn he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.
eng_Latn that is, if you want to run with people who have.
eng_Latn that you've been in a wrong position altogether
eng_Latn even if he doesn't love me.
eng_Latn so they went on all together.
eng_Latn answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well.
eng_Latn by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts
eng_Latn the principal of this establishment, and your employer.
eng_Latn talking to himself in a way that shows plainly he is out of his senses.
eng_Latn took us for ghosts or devils
eng_Latn but when he found himself face to face with the people, he was impotent to do anything, in spite of his good will.
eng_Latn arriving at the point, he fastenedthe rope which
eng_Latn do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd
eng_Latn he at once began to execute complicated figures with the rest of his comrades
eng_Latn I had to talk over a very important matter with him.
eng_Latn This is a book about a legendaryhero and it is called...
eng_Latn I never was whipped in school.
eng_Latn how I laughed and laughed!
eng_Latn instead of one child, he shall have two
eng_Latn let each one mind his own business, and he will be doing enough.
eng_Latn he was himself as one dead.
eng_Latn I guessed that I had been asked to come at just that time not without intention.
eng_Latn being uncommonly shaggy and thick
eng_Latn I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber.
eng_Latn is willing to dine where he may see her again.
eng_Latn And it showed us how to keep warm.
eng_Latn how to broach the so much more important matter that had brought him here.
eng_Latn one bent to the left and the other to the right.
eng_Latn he can't get inside your head any more than I can.
eng_Latn doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his cry
eng_Latn my fingers ached from holding to the ledge.
eng_Latn he has seen after my simple wants
eng_Latn I reached out for her free hand, taking it in both of mine.
eng_Latn the daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and that she, won by his high bred bearing, had fallen in love with him
eng_Latn the discovery that he did so delighted them.
eng_Latn orgot to smoke in their surprise and interest.
eng_Latn that is, some one to worship, some one to keep his conscience
eng_Latn a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp lit room.
eng_Latn they haven't any feeling of poetryand beauty.
eng_Latn that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him.
eng_Latn but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded
eng_Latn that if I should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be
eng_Latn And I'm Professor Asimov. How nice of you to visit me. I didn t see your ship.
eng_Latn I'd never been strong enough to deal with the things outside my control, to attack the enemies or outrun them.
eng_Latn as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it
eng_Latn I woke up last night in a cold sweat and I just thought to myself, if this is true, the world doesn't make sense any more.
eng_Latn brooding over a dull, smoky fire.
eng_Latn he should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself
eng_Latn but with its last strength the carp again plunged into the depths.
eng_Latn I had turned quite cold all over at the sight of her, and at first I could not find my voice.
eng_Latn were already declaring that when the opportunity offered, they were going to learn.
eng_Latn pushed it behind his head and shifted her closer in to his side, sighing softly.
eng_Latn made for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared.
eng_Latn you have still on your brow your master's blood!
eng_Latn the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination
eng_Latn perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company
eng_Latn who had his back towards her at the time.
eng_Latn reached the brim like a well filled bushel of barley.
eng_Latn I held my smile in place with a bit of effort.
eng_Latn Are you certain that amazing fact IS an amazing fact Pug?
eng_Latn I havent any time to talk to you now.
eng_Latn out of the house without being seen.
eng_Latn one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days the golden age of modern literature.
eng_Latn no oneknows who has been there or will be there.
eng_Latn I was always with the house elf.
eng_Latn as long as he knows how to move her to passion each time.
eng_Latn I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting.
eng_Latn found myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.
eng_Latn maybe he's even had to indulge in a purge of the fainthearted.
eng_Latn I was in the kitchen when I heard the sound of gunfire.
eng_Latn I think the railway has done pretty well by its friends without compromising itself hopelessly.
eng_Latn I had no time to try my other pistol
eng_Latn hand raised in the signal that everything was fine
eng_Latn you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.
eng_Latn I'd been away from it too long.
eng_Latn I supposed he didn't need to check.
eng_Latn among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle.
eng_Latn his head done up in a blue scarf.
eng_Latn I speak to you
eng_Latn Well, it's not down here.
eng_Latn I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening
eng_Latn on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week.
eng_Latn with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.
eng_Latn he met only the short growth of wiry bristles,low on his forehead
eng_Latn I told him all my secrets.
eng_Latn I went across the hall and into the dining room once more.
eng_Latn his voice echoing in the dark passage.
eng_Latn I am Dog, and this is Pug ...
eng_Latn brilliant in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk.
eng_Latn a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been able to get it out again.
eng_Latn at last he exploded.
eng_Latn I have never heard of him before.
eng_Latn was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.
eng_Latn I shall kill myself, but first of all that cur.
eng_Latn however I got many birds' eggs
eng_Latn it is a whole solar system on the march.
eng_Latn but your father was not allowed to fall.
eng_Latn Dog, there s a man in the shop!
eng_Latn but he moved to the room planned as the conjugal bedroom on the upper floor.
eng_Latn thinking he should burn it knowing he never could
eng_Latn spread it out on a table
eng_Latn we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity
eng_Latn I should like to help you as far as lies in my power.
eng_Latn but those I love, I love so that I would give my life for them, and the others I'd throttle if they stood in my way.
eng_Latn some one who knows something about life.
eng_Latn which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not possibly do.
eng_Latn my mother asked me all about the day I had had, and what they had said and done.
eng_Latn pushed open the front door.
eng_Latn Now ye be pirates too!
eng_Latn managed very cleverly to give him the support of her arm he really needed.
eng_Latn ...what s on the other side of the something?
eng_Latn lovely boy though she must have been
eng_Latn the names BECKY & TOM had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle smoke
eng_Latn because night overtook me while I was there, and day came
eng_Latn I hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.
eng_Latn I don't have any photos that really show what's going on,
eng_Latn he rather shrieked than said.
eng_Latn I've lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me.
eng_Latn it was already too late for things to return to their former state.
eng_Latn I agreed to risk it.
eng_Latn but I certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and wishes
eng_Latn soldiers ordered to remain where they were
eng_Latn that he attributed to the half glass of brandy at the final toast.
eng_Latn that the street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room
eng_Latn nobody said anything
eng_Latn Oh dear!
eng_Latn her little gentle breathing will do me good.
eng_Latn Greetings Dog and Pug
eng_Latn something of the notary had lingered in him.
eng_Latn An excellent idea, Pug. I will go this way.
eng_Latn except, perhaps, under my protection.
eng_Latn we have scarcely been able to keep alive.
eng_Latn but she did not take her eyes off him, watching how he would take it.
eng_Latn I looked into his eyes and he looked into mine
eng_Latn It's like I ve never been away.
eng_Latn or to ascertain beforehand whether, when he had made himself known, his brother, seeing him so poor, would be ashamed of him
eng_Latn desire most to punish with my own hands
eng_Latn I am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm.
eng_Latn if you'll only pull ahead, and let me heave you the headline
eng_Latn seeing everybody busy about finding out what it was the four men wanted
eng_Latn I waded with what haste I could
eng_Latn where tea was laid ready.
eng_Latn it would be difficult to say
eng_Latn it is really impossible to express how he twisted this ejaculation out of himself
eng_Latn all hands were turned to
eng_Latn as I was not in a condition to resent injuries
eng_Latn her father had changed so much that
eng_Latn I cut the engine and listened to the quiet.
eng_Latn but there would not be a question of discussing each other's business together.
eng_Latn but it didn't work anyway.
eng_Latn when just above his head he heard several voices shouting
eng_Latn I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale line.
eng_Latn ...I love rereading books I ve read before.
eng_Latn I know I love you.
eng_Latn but not yet. I would not accost him yet.
eng_Latn something stood athwart the road
eng_Latn that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.
eng_Latn but I licked you!
eng_Latn no one doubted that he came from far away
eng_Latn sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven.
eng_Latn he walked into something very large and solid
eng_Latn in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.
eng_Latn sharply as they were bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door.
eng_Latn then went into the shed and found an old crate and a can of paint.
eng_Latn but only if we accept this and act fast.
eng_Latn but only two large bubbles came out.
eng_Latn when he laid his hand upon my arm.
eng_Latn they were quiet, staring into the fire.
eng_Latn suffering from that flu that probably hadn't really been a flu.
eng_Latn he wanted to see his own acres stretching green before his eyes.
eng_Latn today the mere thought of it was painful.
eng_Latn apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk
eng_Latn then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.
eng_Latn Really? Mum said it was Gladys.
eng_Latn but it was so odd that it was not quite ugly.
eng_Latn it is their fate to be governed by mad kings.
eng_Latn I started walking to the house, and he followed.
eng_Latn but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly.
eng_Latn I set down one time back in the woods
eng_Latn for, as he shows, he accepts it as a certainty
eng_Latn she is so very unreasonable.
eng_Latn only that mine were all of a colour.
eng_Latn it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world.
eng_Latn lend a hand in fixing up the house.
eng_Latn I can't say that I'd rather die than be this way.
eng_Latn promises that when times were better she would hire free darkies.
eng_Latn I stood crying till the housekeeper reappeared.
eng_Latn Thank you, Dog and Pug!
eng_Latn I got under the table and raised the blanket, and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out big enough to let me through.
eng_Latn And you have one of those every Friday. Be brave.
eng_Latn with nothing to do except stare out the window at the clouds, and think.
eng_Latn but she interrupted him to ask something of her mother.
eng_Latn turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that animal
eng_Latn it says that, withdrawing a little from the others
eng_Latn shuddering against me as he buried his face in my hair.
eng_Latn without any relaxation of anger, or any material digression of thought.
eng_Latn richly as he merited such a fate by her hand.
eng_Latn our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal.
eng_Latn I do not understand you
eng_Latn I hope there is some one else.
eng_Latn According to ALL these books, miceonly like cheese...and you cannot argue with books.
eng_Latn giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings
eng_Latn which had done him no more harm than raising a couple of rather large lumps
eng_Latn because nobody has any money.
eng_Latn even as the woods had done.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite b...oh, am I too late Dog?
eng_Latn I had a notion of that myself at one time.
eng_Latn that the tunnel is of magical origin and can only be closed magically.
eng_Latn blanching with fright.
eng_Latn for ever since he had conversed with the priest
eng_Latn I might if people need cheering up.
eng_Latn I have been waiting in the upper cave for many days, incapable of contacting you.
eng_Latn I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind.
eng_Latn when she turned round at the parlour door, in the dusk
eng_Latn I knew it was you when I looked out the window.
eng_Latn I pulled off my shoes and stockings
eng_Latn nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.
eng_Latn hanging his head in confusion
eng_Latn but I saw that his thoughts were constantly with his wife.
eng_Latn deserted from the front
eng_Latn I don't want to live, because I loathe everything!
eng_Latn I advanced forward
eng_Latn the black thing lay on its back, and its back was arched like a great bow so that it bent upward in the middle.
eng_Latn I'd draw attention to myself.
eng_Latn running for the bush but still dangerous.
eng_Latn total, $31 and 85 cents
eng_Latn I had to smile at her enthusiasm.
eng_Latn she was going away.
eng_Latn I get closer to him for a moment.
eng_Latn ...I love helping books on with their jackets, after the bookshop mice have given them a clean!
eng_Latn he confessed, it is true, that he had confided his idea to some of his friends
eng_Latn a look she had noticed but had not troubled to analyze.
eng_Latn leant against an old ash tree
eng_Latn she had insisted he read it before he buried her
eng_Latn by which they distinguish themselves.
eng_Latn that she was instinctively aware of this
eng_Latn only saved himself by the skin of his teeth.
eng_Latn from the seat to the rack, to the exasperation of his fellow passengers, against whom he knocked
eng_Latn Splashdown!
eng_Latn we on our part will make the best of it
eng_Latn perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
eng_Latn when I awoke it was broad day.
eng_Latn but a few minutes before she had been wishing
eng_Latn with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he had gained in having established his wife's purity
eng_Latn the searing, destroying power of such a thought as that
eng_Latn but impaled his wife on a pitchfork
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn held her and rocked her as if she were a baby.
eng_Latn he gave his brush another gentle sweep
eng_Latn was enough to make it all come rushing mightily up before his gaze.
eng_Latn I d better leave this. It's a dead give away.
eng_Latn you should be engaged without my knowing it
eng_Latn is a work of great erudition and research
eng_Latn perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey.
eng_Latn yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?
eng_Latn he met the introduction halfway.
eng_Latn I was so totally mortified
eng_Latn but protested that all was well.
eng_Latn though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me conveying no meaning.
eng_Latn I may be away abroad.
eng_Latn was so careless as to let a huge frog not perceiving it slip out of his pail.
eng_Latn almostimmediately the lonely dawn light crept over the land.
eng_Latn a most eminent person.
eng_Latn I was hoping that the woman with fair hair would come in
eng_Latn who they say killed herself without having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him on whom the guilt of her misfortune lay.
eng_Latn but no one is above gratitude.
eng_Latn before bending forward with a strained attention.
eng_Latn one of their eyes turned inward, and the other directly up to the zenith.
eng_Latn he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.
eng_Latn I found him in his study, apparently preparing to go out again
eng_Latn she had deceived him was something
eng_Latn they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species.
eng_Latn horizontally suspended the sail needle by its middle, over one of the compass cards.
eng_Latn then I strangled a newborn agony
eng_Latn but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly thought it was thunder.
eng_Latn I had no idea you were ill.
eng_Latn you may have felt the cold in coming here
eng_Latn the moment the water was about him, his thirst was gone.
eng_Latn I flung myself on my face.
eng_Latn which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon.
eng_Latn hoarse from so much roaring
eng_Latn Hey diddle diddle, the cow on the griddle? No. Hey diddle diddle the dog did a... No, that s not right either!
eng_Latn but had yielded them up at last, after many years
eng_Latn to turn your love into rage
eng_Latn And just a joke
eng_Latn if it were only because they are mine
eng_Latn it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!
eng_Latn OR perhaps we have another thing to find...like numbers in the right order!
eng_Latn the power you have over me
eng_Latn think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!
eng_Latn yes, it is indeed he who has so long
eng_Latn but if you take a bad one you will find it hard work to mend her
eng_Latn you are beating on my brain
eng_Latn When you want to clean, it reallyworks a dream...
eng_Latn it is from that house yonder that we must fire.
eng_Latn the music closed with it.
eng_Latn how different it was from shearing.
eng_Latn Camille and Leon danced the night away together. That is how Camille and new friend Leon overcame their shyness and came out into the light.
eng_Latn yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?
eng_Latn in about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language.
eng_Latn that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people
eng_Latn we were forbidden to go near it.
eng_Latn more by token it was sheep's milk cheese.
eng_Latn he saw soldiers drawn up on the embankment
eng_Latn I shall look after them without that.
eng_Latn as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn her control over clyde to all those others
eng_Latn I hated knowing that I could be losing my chance.
eng_Latn I-I am just remembered, I left myspecial giant fighting...hat back at the village. I ll go get it!
eng_Latn he could only say that the end had come.
eng_Latn there are none, except myself.
eng_Latn Bah. This music is wet!
eng_Latn then of course my family has also to be considered
eng_Latn his majesty resolving, if possible, to spare your life
eng_Latn She can t lift high or dig deep.
eng_Latn behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality.
eng_Latn making a bad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum.
eng_Latn never had he worked so hard.
eng_Latn that had never happened before.
eng_Latn I have a puggy feeling we ve metthem before Dog.
eng_Latn swooped in ever increasing circles outward from the beach, searching.
eng_Latn I may be able to ship off my black vassals
eng_Latn placed the summum bonum was in the gifts of nature
eng_Latn I do like playing hide and seek butI'm not very good at the hiding bit.
eng_Latn as I shall raise none
eng_Latn so here I am.
eng_Latn No.
eng_Latn I think Pug really likes playing in plays.
eng_Latn by what accident I came to be set adrift, in that monstrous wooden chest.
eng_Latn it is to be so strongly for, as to be against.
eng_Latn she fell back onto the bed, waiting for the pain to recede.
eng_Latn the other is that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks.
eng_Latn saw that it was nearly eleven hundred
eng_Latn I do not attach any exaggerated importance to my poetical works.
eng_Latn he shunned my eye.
eng_Latn a prime, well fed beast such as takes medals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,
eng_Latn amusing himself by relating transactions which have nothing to do with the sequence of a true history.
eng_Latn I gaze at him, discomfited.
eng_Latn Sorry Dog. We d better start again.
eng_Latn in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin.
eng_Latn the grand mother dropped dead by the stable door.
eng_Latn but it was enough.
eng_Latn I leaned forward, meeting her gaze as if I were staring deeply into her depthless, small brown eyes.
eng_Latn posters of seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes
eng_Latn one of whom knew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few seconds
eng_Latn I hope that's okay by you
eng_Latn knew with a sinking heart that the peace and calm following confession could never be hers.
eng_Latn that is that thou didst ill describe her beauty to me
eng_Latn I jerked, hearing my name.
eng_Latn so as to give to each one what belongs to him and is due to him.
eng_Latn but you'll need it to become a better pencil.
eng_Latn that he had abandoned everything and not left the city
eng_Latn who had contrived a new method for building houses
eng_Latn an old man with theatrical looking white hair.
eng_Latn but it was the last house at the bottom of a narrow street
eng_Latn who had cured an old woman of a malady similar to my own cured her merely with a little hayseed.
eng_Latn she looked admiringly at her daughter.
eng_Latn I wondered if she was making a fool of me.
eng_Latn I haven't heard a word.
eng_Latn Here comes their conductor.
eng_Latn Big Questions ... SimpleAnswers ..Aah. The Unexplained!
eng_Latn since this gentleman has forewarned you
eng_Latn but he felt it necessary to assert himself.
eng_Latn as he had thrown the glass.
eng_Latn That doesn t seem very fair.
eng_Latn looked on without speaking.
eng_Latn he had already seen it when it was teeming with life, and he would never forget it.
eng_Latn so we took a gray view of the place.
eng_Latn I thought you looked so sad when you came up stairs.
eng_Latn splitting rails and nursing sick old animals that they had forgotten such things as balls and pleasant flirtations ever existed.
eng_Latn if you are not the second person in the history
eng_Latn with a promise that he should have his work presently.
eng_Latn so that at first I was not quite sure
eng_Latn I seem to have feathers under my head.
eng_Latn setting sail for some other harbor.
eng_Latn he washed the lettuce, heopened the olive bottle.
eng_Latn there was another loud rap on the door.
eng_Latn it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable, condemned heads.
eng_Latn war are the same thing
eng_Latn but they were not the breeches.
eng_Latn for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect
eng_Latn I've never spoken like that in my life, I say.
eng_Latn she made her stay in bed for five days and
eng_Latn reminding me that summer was officially over.
eng_Latn the little church had been so full before.
eng_Latn there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear.
eng_Latn that is why people object to it.
eng_Latn or if he had merely trifled with her affections and then forgotten her.
eng_Latn therefore any evil that affects or shall affect me should give thee pain
eng_Latn Pug, are you and the Bookshop Mice having fun too?
eng_Latn How do you feel?
eng_Latn sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.
eng_Latn I've been here for an hour
eng_Latn so naively brazen as to disarm the hate of a man courageous enough not to be afraid of its irresponsible potency to ruin everything it touched.
eng_Latn I command you to paint my royalportrait!
eng_Latn secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso
eng_Latn but scarcely cared enough to do it well.
eng_Latn this step he had taken since the preceding evening.
eng_Latn but certainly to take pleasure in talking to them.
eng_Latn but perceiving that the music had now turned to sobs and heart rending moans
eng_Latn but even in the original it was striking enough.
eng_Latn there is no one with whom to treat for their ransom, even though they may have the means.
eng_Latn but she made him pay for her services so strictly
eng_Latn as if toil were life itself
eng_Latn then took it out
eng_Latn Excuse me for a moment.
eng_Latn replied the stranger with a slight hesitation, and blushing
eng_Latn you will lose the one as readily as you will the other.
eng_Latn it was impossible to pick them out.
eng_Latn beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad
eng_Latn had to stop.
eng_Latn I wondered if there was a way to take his hand without admitting my fear.
eng_Latn I was glad for the poor fellow, and went home.
eng_Latn It must have been raining where they went too.
eng_Latn I wondered if she would guess immediately who I was as well.
eng_Latn if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
eng_Latn with anything short of an entire retractation
eng_Latn if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?
eng_Latn Dog, your nose is sleeping and I think the rest of you is too.
eng_Latn And so are my friends Dog and Pug.
eng_Latn I want to know how long I'm gonna have to be here.
eng_Latn polishing the brass on deck.
eng_Latn waiting for the room to clear.
eng_Latn promising to return the next morning.
eng_Latn but to make sure she had gotten the money for which she had been so desperate.
eng_Latn all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love.
eng_Latn I didn't foresee that she would be so good for him.
eng_Latn I saw what he meant, and for a moment the room swam around me.
eng_Latn that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him
eng_Latn I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera.
eng_Latn I couldn't hold back a small snarl of my own.
eng_Latn I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it
eng_Latn she paused in semi mock modesty as did the others.
eng_Latn it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it
eng_Latn how we had a dispute about it.
eng_Latn like your father did.
eng_Latn for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just like them.
eng_Latn it left me in darkness.
eng_Latn to enter on the subject as you wish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.
eng_Latn he set out alone on his fourteen miles' journey
eng_Latn We are our own size Princess.
eng_Latn has done for you he gave you health
eng_Latn but she chose to keep their relationship on an impersonal, business level.
eng_Latn until now that he was come to the brink of it, and saw her on the other side.
eng_Latn the materials bought, and the slippers begun.
eng_Latn how we had a dispute about it.
eng_Latn though her heart knew him at once.
eng_Latn I have a paper here for you to sign, the attorney announced.
eng_Latn even goes a couple of bowshots beyond the greatest.
eng_Latn to check their things for the next day.
eng_Latn but I think the sight of me alarmed you.
eng_Latn west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe
eng_Latn I was so unprepared.
eng_Latn a most important personage!
eng_Latn making peace before it could turn into a fight.
eng_Latn up to this moment she had scarcely given her sex a thought.
eng_Latn the fourteen players rose toward the leaden sky
eng_Latn Mrs Honey Bunny!
eng_Latn who had trafficked through the region for half his life
eng_Latn I had several men who died in my ship of calentures
eng_Latn it seemed to him that either
eng_Latn that angel resembles the one I have lost.
eng_Latn resolved to get rid of their names
eng_Latn with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face.
eng_Latn your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.
eng_Latn to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters.
eng_Latn until the crypt in the family mausoleum was sealed.
eng_Latn two guns smashed, and no supports at all.
eng_Latn Puzzle number three.
eng_Latn I shall be glad to have him away from my eyes
eng_Latn I tiptoed down the path
eng_Latn I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!
eng_Latn held the vessel to his lips
eng_Latn the man he was convinced he had silenced with money.
eng_Latn on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
eng_Latn told them of the stores we had left
eng_Latn I should sue the shop for fraud.
eng_Latn because my body had a different covering from others of my kind.
eng_Latn removed her spectacles and began to polish the lenses with a piece of tissue.
eng_Latn And the penguin who felt the cold never felt the cold again. Because feeling warmer was always a run up and down a hill away.
eng_Latn as showing that even a beadle
eng_Latn even carried her deference so far as to ask for a recipe for pickling gherkins.
eng_Latn I shall be on the king's left and as I am the chief person threatened, remain at the coach door to the left.
eng_Latn And the dish ran away with the spoon.
eng_Latn she was too much upset to think of singing again.
eng_Latn I ordered a large coffee and a couple of frankfurters.
eng_Latn THE IDEA OF FATHERHOOD unleashed a swirl of emotions in me.
eng_Latn in fact, the mere vision of it arising before his mind in the still watches of the night had the power to exasperate him into hours of hot and agitated insomnia.
eng_Latn here is another thing that comes to me, just now to say.
eng_Latn I had the honour of being passed on the road.
eng_Latn though he had many friends who would willingly have done so
eng_Latn the priest, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them
eng_Latn I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.
eng_Latn And miss our bedtime doggy biscuits!
eng_Latn all those palfreys, and damsels errant, and serpents
eng_Latn from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl ' a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl ' a long quill, and a roll of parchment.
eng_Latn so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home.
eng_Latn his lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout
eng_Latn so profound was the sensation that
eng_Latn I ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed.
eng_Latn Thank you, Pug. You re a hero.
eng_Latn but she firmly believed that something would very soon turn up now.
eng_Latn you will only have to look at night
eng_Latn I smiled at the way he said my name
eng_Latn I'm the man who speaks for the latter age
eng_Latn that is the TrunchbulPs great secret.
eng_Latn who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers.
eng_Latn but the great safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions were not acted on.
eng_Latn I never see money hauled in by the wagon load like that before.
eng_Latn he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house.
eng_Latn he had withstood this temptation.
eng_Latn I shall regret and repent it till I die!
eng_Latn I thought you mightn't like me to have my meals with you.
eng_Latn but weakly, unconvincingly.
eng_Latn for he was the main cause of all this thrashing.
eng_Latn he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming.
eng_Latn being not much out of his course
eng_Latn extolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant, gentle and simple
eng_Latn in order that there might be no misunderstanding or painful sense of doubt and mystery between them.
eng_Latn I have encountered manymischievous beasts and learnt much about their peculiar ways in my study of animal behaviour, but none so unique as the creature I met one afternoon at Buckingham Palace.
eng_Latn I might make something out of this if I handled it properly.
eng_Latn so that I didn't know she was dead till the sister told me.
eng_Latn I saw that the table next to ours, left vacant for three days, was to be occupied once more.
eng_Latn will you restore him to us cured of his melancholy?
eng_Latn he shook his head
eng_Latn the sailor would have been stifled before he could draw his cutlass.
eng_Latn but the tack tack tack came through the window again.
eng_Latn he asked me the meaning of what his servant had reported
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn but not to one who does not
eng_Latn I must run to rehearsal.
eng_Latn I stare out of the window
eng_Latn I hope you wont make us go before she comes.
eng_Latn wearing a jacket and tie.
eng_Latn I seen it was that way.
eng_Latn wide eyed, clasping a hand over her mouth.
eng_Latn Come back here and taste zapper…
eng_Latn he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone's expectation.
eng_Latn I am so sorry. I had no idea...
eng_Latn her eye glancing on her sweetheart, who is near me.
eng_Latn then went into the shed and found an old crate and a can of paint.
eng_Latn it is not wise, at any rate this moist season.
eng_Latn my whole body wanted a fence against heat and cold
eng_Latn that had not always been hers but had become hers more than anyone' s.
eng_Latn he had another outbreak of his nights as a solitary hunter
eng_Latn directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.
eng_Latn because it has awakened and has begun to beat again
eng_Latn who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution
eng_Latn You won t be in my book.
eng_Latn was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight
eng_Latn but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on,
eng_Latn I went out of the room like the coward
eng_Latn I had not deceived him, though, not for a moment.
eng_Latn but nothing else, she feared, would cure her.
eng_Latn I ain't got nothing on under my trousers.
eng_Latn suggest visiting a car show.
eng_Latn which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island to the other.
eng_Latn then almost with one impulse the congregation rose
eng_Latn I didn't take it!
eng_Latn but to each of us he has given the responsibility of NAVIGATION.
eng_Latn Granny Pug s Guide to AmazingCampsites of The World.
eng_Latn because he knew from the names of their skippers they must have suspect backgrounds.
eng_Latn he considered the alternatives, the mysterious balance of light and darkness.
eng_Latn her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.
eng_Latn besides, it was impossible for me to do
eng_Latn but she declined availing herself of it
eng_Latn that he might not be known by his gossip when they met
eng_Latn till he could find a seat by her, would not sit at all.
eng_Latn so deeply was the revery of the one absorbed and sunk in the revery of the other.
eng_Latn felt that the peasants heard nothing but the sound of his voice,
eng_Latn he had to choose between me and his people.
eng_Latn seized each other's hands, kissing them and pulling them away
eng_Latn this standing still
eng_Latn see how sorry she is for you!
eng_Latn with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.
eng_Latn Are you having trouble saying things today Dog?
eng_Latn There now appears to be more of them.
eng_Latn Pug? Have you found anything magical yet?
eng_Latn turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance
eng_Latn but was strangely harassed by a queer, half witted man
eng_Latn in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit.
eng_Latn which they could see through the branches of the large trees, and which diverted them greatly.
eng_Latn to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea.
eng_Latn it had turned white during the hour he had sat there.
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all I love a book that is full of...
eng_Latn I do want it.
eng_Latn but as I had sworn that he should speak first, I continued to lie still and the more willingly
eng_Latn even decent boys need reminding sometimes.
eng_Latn her hair frizzy on one side and flat against her head on the other
eng_Latn I feared a reverse for him
eng_Latn I fell down a hole and hit my head
eng_Latn but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.
eng_Latn he took notice of my gown.
eng_Latn if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive tomorrow with the child
eng_Latn I went through the library to the little room beyond.
eng_Latn which being completely deserted and having neither soldiers nor revenue officers
eng_Latn but he did not like to be questioned while he was reading
eng_Latn for after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play
eng_Latn usage by him but for fear of causing him to sin.
eng_Latn we might go for a canter sometime.
eng_Latn deny me not the happiness thou canst give me by such good news.
eng_Latn convinced that they could pass fairly and impartially on thefacts presented to them.
eng_Latn as if it were destined to endure for ever.
eng_Latn he seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.
eng_Latn Umm But we re going to need more Earthdust and some baboons...
eng_Latn who looked at him with doubtful surprise.
eng_Latn I ran away from home when I was fourteen and joined a carnival.
eng_Latn she raised one hand as if in protest.
eng_Latn but at first he thought it was empty.
eng_Latn she had watched beside a couple.
eng_Latn I love dearly to hear people describe their travels.
eng_Latn had to seek other pastimes for his idle hours.
eng_Latn though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.
eng_Latn I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting spell on the door.
eng_Latn grief and disappointment are hastening his death.
eng_Latn it was in pursuit of this aim that she had gone to town and run about the world
eng_Latn how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home
eng_Latn a task which she seldom found difficult.
eng_Latn stay, for not by my fault, but my horse's, am I stretched here
eng_Latn where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of boats on the lake
eng_Latn at the same time producing four pocket handkerchiefs.
eng_Latn I could be back here in as little as two days with a suitable person
eng_Latn I think he entered the service
eng_Latn she had neither engaged herself in her usual work, nor had she read to him.
eng_Latn I tried to reason through it.
eng_Latn no snap or go in him and his fellows.
eng_Latn she was unable to give the full invitation she wished
eng_Latn I didn t know it were yer treasure.
eng_Latn desired my permission to explain to the company what I had spoke.
eng_Latn took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.
eng_Latn while their mothers sat under the trees with their baskets of butter and eggs.
eng_Latn as come back and leave the house unvisited.
eng_Latn he looked more like a quarterback than a doctor.
eng_Latn he said mournfully.
eng_Latn added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.
eng_Latn or it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.
eng_Latn turn thine eyes and look, and thou wilt see stretched there a knight errant
eng_Latn a wordless plea
eng_Latn but she did not show it.
eng_Latn I did not expect you today
eng_Latn That s why the lighthouse lamp isso important. It warns boats that there are rocks nearby. It must shine brightly all through the night or...
eng_Latn I have not taken the time to dress myself
eng_Latn while indistinguishable figures descended from a wagon.
eng_Latn I'll tell you from the beginning.
eng_Latn if he had admired them.
eng_Latn Giant, I hath defeated you!
eng_Latn And I'm more grown-down. Pleaseread it to me.
eng_Latn she wanted now, at once, to embrace the man she loved
eng_Latn I made an awful mistake the first day.
eng_Latn so the entire afternoon went by without a single opportunity.
eng_Latn for he desired this, and even that the door should be locked.
eng_Latn all those hours in the library.
eng_Latn of whose recovery they despaired
eng_Latn for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water.
eng_Latn he had met so many idiots in the course of his life!
eng_Latn again forced himself into the little chair
eng_Latn we cried, both of us, the whole time I stayed
eng_Latn Not only is my smileremarkable...the rest of me is too!
eng_Latn but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness.
eng_Latn this time there was no homework to finish or egg to eat.
eng_Latn to be my second self, and best earthly companion.
eng_Latn she cried aloud in her despair.
eng_Latn but immensely matter of fact.
eng_Latn trying to get him out of bed and into trouble.
eng_Latn he must undress and get into bed before I did.
eng_Latn I anticipate very little trouble between us on that score.
eng_Latn but on commercial speculations.
eng_Latn I got up and offered her my seat in the arm chair.
eng_Latn I shall bid you do it, or else renounce me.
eng_Latn I won't let you go on playing.
eng_Latn but there were no more hits.
eng_Latn it was a very serious charge
eng_Latn it returned to the stammer of acharter.
eng_Latn I prayed for courage in a blind despairing way
eng_Latn I've noticed that people men in particular are crabbier when they're hungry.
eng_Latn I led the way into my sitting room and asked him to sit down.
eng_Latn that credit at present was dead and buried.
eng_Latn I am wrong!
eng_Latn he learned that there had been a great battle that evening.
eng_Latn that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
eng_Latn like when you escaped from the demon tree.
eng_Latn she is allowed to speak her mind now, but she won't do it.
eng_Latn the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn
eng_Latn bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused.
eng_Latn a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
eng_Latn That means we sleep in the day andgo out at night. And we re not the only ones.
eng_Latn until her little daughter was six years old.
eng_Latn which was indeed a prodigious leap.
eng_Latn hoping to make something good enough to print.
eng_Latn surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs.
eng_Latn I helped her, , to the edge of the bank
eng_Latn it was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs
eng_Latn than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now.
eng_Latn that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open
eng_Latn because I think it is nice to be engaged.
eng_Latn at an age where they deserve it
eng_Latn in short, he drew her portrait in his imagination with the same features and in the same style as that
eng_Latn pushed her eyeglasses up onto her forehead, a
eng_Latn knocked the doctor's musket into bits.
eng_Latn he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.
eng_Latn till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight.
eng_Latn I think I began to muse about something altogether different.
eng_Latn you ought to get into a hot bath till it was all over.
eng_Latn returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.
eng_Latn balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.
eng_Latn Five pairs of pairs Dog!
eng_Latn were carried down and dumped in the courtyard at the back.
eng_Latn a dead silence.
eng_Latn Boys I think it's time to leave the past alone.
eng_Latn I shall go at once, but it may be too late.
eng_Latn consented to comply with his wishes
eng_Latn went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard.
eng_Latn I ran down to the ruins to see what the mine had done.
eng_Latn which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them.
eng_Latn I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people
eng_Latn I want seventy five cents more.
eng_Latn without a position for our left flank
eng_Latn to get out of here, lose myself in the desert and die on my own world.
eng_Latn I met her somewhere last night.
eng_Latn besides, they advised me not to come that they did not need me.
eng_Latn so I come down the back way.
eng_Latn she must recognize the change in his position.
eng_Latn I woke up last night in a cold sweat and I just thought to myself, if this is true, the world doesn't make sense any more.
eng_Latn just as the door handle turned.
eng_Latn had been sleeping for several months in its bed of manure.
eng_Latn I'd never met any vampires less civilized.
eng_Latn took it up, and examined it very attentively.
eng_Latn with such strength that the light creaked like a fishing boat.
eng_Latn Baboons Dog?
eng_Latn knitting away assiduously.
eng_Latn u, I decidedly refused him
eng_Latn for all you had in me is gone.
eng_Latn but thanks to a certain strange circumstance which had perhaps no connection whatever with the matter at issue.
eng_Latn I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither!
eng_Latn but it didn't stir, and I knew it was dead.
eng_Latn of which there may be more than two thousand
eng_Latn how dear and comforting they could be
eng_Latn when he too lay here there would be nothing left living to mark the fact.
eng_Latn I have narrated all this as best I could
eng_Latn moreover he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper
eng_Latn only that he had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised.
eng_Latn but I won't tell him.
eng_Latn she had never seen anybody so splendidly do justice to her talent.
eng_Latn if he himself had said that
eng_Latn do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.
eng_Latn will show the thread of her coarse homespun stuff.
eng_Latn but she had given her word that she would return that same evening.
eng_Latn see if you can manage to tell me the truth.
eng_Latn as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first
eng_Latn twenty six battalions rode to meettwenty six battalions.
eng_Latn as if tea had the restorative powers of brandy.
eng_Latn I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything
eng_Latn he reverted to the bewitched sleep version of events.
eng_Latn You don t understand! You ve got to let me go - I need to find a special BUTTERFLY! A very rare BUTTERFLY!
eng_Latn that's all I hear of his making.
eng_Latn I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.
eng_Latn I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.
eng_Latn I s must be very popular.
eng_Latn I tendered my hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.
eng_Latn he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.
eng_Latn he had revealed to her duty and the beauty of action.
eng_Latn so that you can feel like everything's in its place again.
eng_Latn as if the burden sat askew, would not distribute itself so she could bear it properly.
eng_Latn who told me he had not a drop of vinegar in his camp.
eng_Latn whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.
eng_Latn I hastily pull it out and press green.
eng_Latn he slept soundly
eng_Latn I'll stake my reputation on that.
eng_Latn you would have been taken in
eng_Latn he could not decide which, so elaborately intertwined was the engraved penmanship.
eng_Latn they squirmed and jumped about as well, shouting
eng_Latn I wish you a good day.
eng_Latn but some dark doubt or care sits on him.
eng_Latn suspended the use of red armbands
eng_Latn he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself upon it
eng_Latn though I confess I don't think I shall.
eng_Latn turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village
eng_Latn locked her up in her bedroom.
eng_Latn he then heard a noise of something falling
eng_Latn but I've been called to the studio on an emergency.
eng_Latn then he found himself before the mangle
eng_Latn Let's never fall out again.
eng_Latn but now I found it in vain to do so any longer.
eng_Latn And your reward for helping me today is...
eng_Latn but I will not tolerate your behavior!
eng_Latn finding it to exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one.
eng_Latn so you may as well sit down.
eng_Latn having done this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness.
eng_Latn I said to restart the conversation so that I could hear her voice again.
eng_Latn I would not turn away from it till I had drained it!
eng_Latn Now you ve rubbed out Pug!
eng_Latn Dog kennels... Dogtanian... DogBiscuits!
eng_Latn I just read this over before sealing it.
eng_Latn I'm sorry you wasted the trip.
eng_Latn I bucked like a colt.
eng_Latn waited for the portrait hole to open.
eng_Latn Good point. You can bat instead.Here!
eng_Latn he ran away, near a month ago, from his parents
eng_Latn Dog! Hey. No nibbling there.
eng_Latn I like to pay my debts
eng_Latn she boldly snatched up her green flowered skirts
eng_Latn but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.
eng_Latn And... he loves books!
eng_Latn he could not stop himself flinching, suppress the exclamation of pain.
eng_Latn but had flatly refused to return.
eng_Latn he poured too many drops into the glass.
eng_Latn but setting here resting or sleeping on the ground
eng_Latn I tried to erase the anger from my system entirely
eng_Latn as where there were many children
eng_Latn perhaps, because his wife disliked him.
eng_Latn that I still waited for him, and that still he did not come out, and lay down again.
eng_Latn bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.
eng_Latn even 'rsula perceived it in her dark corner
eng_Latn I for one love it.
eng_Latn perhaps he exaggerated.
eng_Latn I was here when you were lying ill in bed
eng_Latn mention his having an ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
eng_Latn That s because it's having some exercise!
eng_Latn I reckon tailors is your trade.
eng_Latn continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle
eng_Latn but I despise you just the same.
eng_Latn I told him mine, which was down that street there
eng_Latn the obligation of uttering balderdash personally was by no means included in the bargain.
eng_Latn he paused, than to have a good sleep.
eng_Latn her life was shortened by trouble.
eng_Latn everybody was asleep.
eng_Latn she fired both barrels of a shotgun at her husband
eng_Latn till the vessel swung only by two.
eng_Latn gave instructions in the kitchen for supper, and went to the bedroom.
eng_Latn my voice came out higher than usual because the word took me so by surprise.
eng_Latn better get under cover before the cyclone hits town!
eng_Latn I then conjectured might relate to me
eng_Latn an ordinary stockman, stealing her from under their noses!
eng_Latn I just waved the magic wand and now I don t know how to stop them.
eng_Latn the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
eng_Latn Pug said it was the best part of the day and it took us all the way to
eng_Latn he'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.
eng_Latn if when I read you all that about the 'poor knight,' I wished to to praise you for one thing
eng_Latn she did not think it was decent to accept without the consent of her fiance .
eng_Latn I thought about ducking out
eng_Latn listening to their footsteps dying away.
eng_Latn he turned out the overhead light, using the switch next to the door
eng_Latn there were scarcely six months between them.
eng_Latn Much hattier.
eng_Latn then the horror of utter darkness reigned!
eng_Latn the father has mourned sufficiently
eng_Latn Was it something I said? Dog, I keep upsetting mini-beasts today!
eng_Latn I ground my teeth together.
eng_Latn that will take her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety?
eng_Latn being not much out of his course
eng_Latn then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing.
eng_Latn trying at the same time to put an air of gallantry into his attitude.
eng_Latn pulled on his cloak for warmth
eng_Latn Granny!
eng_Latn It doesn t say that in the diary Pug.
eng_Latn I left the dinghy on the buoy
eng_Latn Maybe that s why I had a red feather behind my ear. Maybe I flapped it up and down and flew us to safety.
eng_Latn Just a spot of research for the next edition of Granny s Book of Records.
eng_Latn her uncle had some special reason for delivering this opinion
eng_Latn I crept close to my mother's side according to my old custom, broken now a long time
eng_Latn for any new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.
eng_Latn unless they previously produced their papers.
eng_Latn we are as well informed as you
eng_Latn but the truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used.
eng_Latn then ushered her in too soon.
eng_Latn you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
eng_Latn No, there s only spare rope andspecial shoes for walking on the snow.
eng_Latn you do not realize how profound is your thought, nor how true.
eng_Latn dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was his own property.
eng_Latn I didn't altogether see why it was of course
eng_Latn an empty chair stood against the wall
eng_Latn I told you that it was all about practice.
eng_Latn I know your father's turned idiot
eng_Latn she would carry the memory of it all her life.
eng_Latn or a plate of bread and cheese and a glass of beer
eng_Latn still sat holding his letters in his hand and looking on the ground meditatively
eng_Latn not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.
eng_Latn I will look after your interests, and went still faster along the passage.
eng_Latn whether they troubled to entertain him socially or not.
eng_Latn you've no need to be.
eng_Latn suddenly changing his tone
eng_Latn I heard him say so.
eng_Latn Oh. I'm very sorry, Dish and Spoon. But your race can t begin until the high jump is over. So far Jack Be Nimble has only managed to jump over a candlestick so the bar has been set, literally, pretty low.
eng_Latn as the vision of waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the water which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue.
eng_Latn I'm not your assistant and I never will be.
eng_Latn that was the place where he first saw her.
eng_Latn but I guess it's a bit late for warnings like that.
eng_Latn she promised to explain matters, and I departed.
eng_Latn in thee to desire to take that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer
eng_Latn requested her to remove her veil.
eng_Latn but your father died in your arms
eng_Latn he wretched that she should considerhim old.
eng_Latn for the first time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men.
eng_Latn brought me within three yards of his eyes.
eng_Latn indispensable to hostesses.
eng_Latn was glad at heart to receive this intelligence.
eng_Latn who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him.
eng_Latn he finally disappeared, extinguished by paralysis.
eng_Latn change the course, or delay in it' for any reason' and no life can possibly be saved
eng_Latn I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair.
eng_Latn it had all come upon me so suddenly.
eng_Latn just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge
eng_Latn We like your new style!
eng_Latn another to enter deliberately on the necessity of falsehood.
eng_Latn No. First we have to make our way up the rocky hillside path, and rescue Uncle Quentin from the old crumbling castle.
eng_Latn he will do him all the good that lies in his power.
eng_Latn I'm ashamed of you for crying.
eng_Latn his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times this same arm of his
eng_Latn presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it
eng_Latn crossed his legs
eng_Latn I pulled myself up on my elbow so that I could see his face better.
eng_Latn I'm sorry Dog.
eng_Latn I was afraid you'd take it like this!
eng_Latn one would almost think you didn't want visitors.
eng_Latn I need it from you, and from nobody else in the world.
eng_Latn her needle in her right
eng_Latn casting one glance towards the young man
eng_Latn I can't tell why we should stay.
eng_Latn he had been the candle and not the some one.
eng_Latn that one must passer par dessus toutes ces finesses de sentiment.
eng_Latn I was an exact _Yahoo_ in every part
eng_Latn I mean not having anything to do with any of the girls.
eng_Latn My poor paws. They can barely turn the pages of my book.
eng_Latn dearer to me than any blood sister could ever be.
eng_Latn I was looking forward to watching you mature.
eng_Latn one of the big girls has justtold me that I have only nine years and ten months longer to remainhere.
eng_Latn I deleted it.
eng_Latn have the chance of getting a bit of the country into good fettle, as they say
eng_Latn then I called him a beggar.
eng_Latn I confess I do not want to.
eng_Latn there were three times as many people employed as were necessary
eng_Latn since it is only about a year ago that she herself proposed entering a convent
eng_Latn hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside.
eng_Latn unless the purchase is less than 10 per cent of the company's stock
eng_Latn I say this because, if I mistake not
eng_Latn felt a pang
eng_Latn I was right to come here.
eng_Latn now relegated forgotten to the bedroom.
eng_Latn your only thought is not to let him get away!
eng_Latn rest assured that it is to woe itself and affliction itself you come.
eng_Latn impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship.
eng_Latn And now we can.....
eng_Latn but that is no name either for man or beast,
eng_Latn but were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen
eng_Latn for no one had died up till then
eng_Latn not that it is bad or ill told
eng_Latn there was already three feet of water
eng_Latn inhabited by the door keeper of the cemetery.
eng_Latn to remember that I have some power in this world
eng_Latn those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she did not let it out of her hands.
eng_Latn Now there s no way to read us home.
eng_Latn his bearers listened with breathless interest.
eng_Latn but the certain knowledge that in an hour, then in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now this very INSTANT
eng_Latn flung it full at that young gentleman.
eng_Latn if he prints it again
eng_Latn yet not so high as to appear haughty.
eng_Latn that on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside the city
eng_Latn I'm saying nothing.
eng_Latn an anguished chill at the thought of it affecting him almostobservably.
eng_Latn I hope to find good reason for confiding the new hospital to his management.
eng_Latn That would be very educational.
eng_Latn dark haired, lanky, bent over a book
eng_Latn wiping his mouth on his sleeve
eng_Latn had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future.
eng_Latn has been again struck by the same hand
eng_Latn but I don't know in what street.
eng_Latn who looked stonily back.
eng_Latn then I became a thief
eng_Latn as the people above him gasped
eng_Latn A billabong is a water hole Pug,but this water is more like mud, and quickly drying in the sun!
eng_Latn was stunned and outraged
eng_Latn I have nothing for you to do.
eng_Latn I believe I shall not live there any more.
eng_Latn I almost married a little kyke who'd been after me for years.
eng_Latn then we knew that we were indeed very close.
eng_Latn I accept the calamity as an accomplished fact, and am doing my best to help both her and you,
eng_Latn I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it
eng_Latn fourteen brooms rose into the air.
eng_Latn the old servant who was holding the count's hand got up and said something to the ladies.
eng_Latn then we will go to bed.
eng_Latn was slowly, distinctly read, the fearful, the unbelieving, &. shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone
eng_Latn here indeed there might be secrets not capable of explanation to a woman's reason.
eng_Latn I know a lotta girls dont like him.
eng_Latn it was already ankle deep about his boots.
eng_Latn not that I blamed her or anyone else for wanting him.
eng_Latn the courtyard was full of carriages
eng_Latn Let us sit here and enjoy it. Be in the moment.
eng_Latn she should see any wide opening where she followed him.
eng_Latn in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman
eng_Latn Ooh They are still chasing us?
eng_Latn since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much as letters
eng_Latn but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness
eng_Latn We followed her doggy pawprints in the sand .
eng_Latn Actually that s two words.
eng_Latn it is virtually our own judgment
eng_Latn it was certain that he would rise to the greatest heights of his profession.
eng_Latn for it was full of amiability and sweetness, and there was a simplicity in it,
eng_Latn I saw a piece of news and began to read it.
eng_Latn his lips were smiling.
eng_Latn was lying two feet away from where it had started.
eng_Latn I am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients!
eng_Latn glanced at his watch.
eng_Latn I thought'well, I thought maybe we could all go in town
eng_Latn I was wearing the blue suit I had on when I came down here.
eng_Latn with the next destination and the day you have to arrive.
eng_Latn he looked up and his fingers stilled.
eng_Latn bring it back with him to restore the fallen grandeur of his line.
eng_Latn I mean he made it seem like good weather.
eng_Latn he would exclaim as he said this
eng_Latn the best of them all.
eng_Latn he hastened to cleave his way through them to see if he had not lost his strength
eng_Latn I think you might come and make my acquaintance
eng_Latn flicked through the blank pages
eng_Latn if he disliked his choice
eng_Latn Certainly Dog...How about this one?
eng_Latn he tried demolition charge to blow the door
eng_Latn if there can be force in a boiler
eng_Latn I might find somewhere where I can finish my book.
eng_Latn I only know what other men have done.
eng_Latn a glimmering of light in chaos.
eng_Latn I spun, ducking my head to look under the table.
eng_Latn his kind, strong mouth said thoughtfully and deliberately
eng_Latn I sailed and paddled together to the south
eng_Latn I feared my brain was disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes.
eng_Latn Aah! She s happy. All that running has warmed her up -and me too.
eng_Latn his face white in the moonlight
eng_Latn the monkey was seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building.
eng_Latn I'll scold papa for quarrelling with him.
eng_Latn I might not even speak to him.
eng_Latn Give that to me!
eng_Latn on peril of his life
eng_Latn I tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master's house
eng_Latn I went upstairs to take off my things.
eng_Latn but I think it will be difficult for your worship to speak with her or see her
eng_Latn And now it is time for a treat of our own.
eng_Latn The hat for giving orders has gone to his head!
eng_Latn I said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer, and made of two widths.
eng_Latn but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods,
eng_Latn which I had fallen into through the common imbecility of human nature
eng_Latn just after his father went out.
eng_Latn for he had never yet liked to mention the subject
eng_Latn there in the centre lay the unhappy maid
eng_Latn take all knowledge as mere nourishment to his moral pathology and therapeutics.
eng_Latn now tell me, which is the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?
eng_Latn determined as he was to venture all upon a single blow.
eng_Latn I don’t really want to... Excuse me madam, but have you seen a Snark?
eng_Latn even though he had not believed in it till then.
eng_Latn I don't take no offense 'cept a bust in the nose.
eng_Latn never knowing he suffered.
eng_Latn I lost this here leg and this here eye.
eng_Latn I was set on shore on this coast
eng_Latn so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could.
eng_Latn I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated a little bungler.
eng_Latn but the fighting was too petty for that call.
eng_Latn when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm
eng_Latn while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his right
eng_Latn I stick out my hand and hail a taxi
eng_Latn both my fear and my hope proved ill founded.
eng_Latn I and my life are like a young man and his betrothed.
eng_Latn And it made me want to ask lots of questions too!
eng_Latn I've taken care of myself since I was eleven that's when my mother died.
eng_Latn but I cannot write the words of our conversation.
eng_Latn but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past
eng_Latn I haven t found the CheshireCat, but I did have a funny feeling while I was looking.
eng_Latn I'm going with them.
eng_Latn being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way.
eng_Latn for the service he rendered me is still fresh.
eng_Latn he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.
eng_Latn Except I'm really hot now!
eng_Latn ‘Just the place for a Snark the Bellman cried as he landed his crew with care.’
eng_Latn they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than by comparison.
eng_Latn You brought me back safe and sound!
eng_Latn because in the dreams he can talk.
eng_Latn he much regretted what had occurred
eng_Latn it is your place to seek the assassin.
eng_Latn I never heard of a demon being summoned that way.
eng_Latn I beseech you to let me bring him here.
eng_Latn though he prided himself on keeping up with whatever was the latest fad.
eng_Latn why should she who is loved for her beauty part
eng_Latn That rock is alive!
eng_Latn begging me to attend the opera.
eng_Latn somebody was dead
eng_Latn the bastard kicked me out in such a hurry.
eng_Latn I've never yet wanted a woman bad enough to marry her.
eng_Latn mingled anguish and humiliation overcame him completely.
eng_Latn without order or discipline.
eng_Latn looked into an empty field
eng_Latn I want him to go away
eng_Latn then he looked at the thin blue skin, the wasting of her little arms
eng_Latn I can drill a dime at fifty yards.
eng_Latn without paying any more attention to him.
eng_Latn or I'll be having another kind of talk with you.
eng_Latn his only weakness being a good and very fast car.
eng_Latn I actually started wandering along the bank in that direction, and then when I'd gone about ten yards I turned back.
eng_Latn they will be friends
eng_Latn he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt.
eng_Latn I'll eat this whale in one mouthful.
eng_Latn who could help her husband out with reasons
eng_Latn he'll be of use here if he's a brave officer
eng_Latn his officers should be commanded to let me pass
eng_Latn set the emerald on the desk in front of him, and dialed a number.
eng_Latn strode quickly from the room.
eng_Latn but reflecting perhaps, that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it
eng_Latn but he left, shutting the door with a snap.
eng_Latn but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour.
eng_Latn but the professor assured us, that if it were dexterously performed, the cure would be infallible.
eng_Latn loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway.
eng_Latn bring his heart to its final pause.
eng_Latn would you have tears for him?
eng_Latn saw once more my native country, after an absence of five years and six months complete.
eng_Latn on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat.
eng_Latn not a pickle eater.
eng_Latn I am afraid mine would not carry me even to the pitch of doing well what has been done already
eng_Latn I don't like cages, I never did.
eng_Latn I'll let you have it with the certificate.
eng_Latn cause those talons hurt.
eng_Latn I have made it my business to keep this very hope up.
eng_Latn however disagreeable to her his going.
eng_Latn recently occupied and temporarily used.
eng_Latn that of a whale ship at sea.
eng_Latn said only that he had never been sick in his life.
eng_Latn though they had been there a long time.
eng_Latn but he advanced his own position a good deal.
eng_Latn the eyes round and bright and she was sitting there speechless
eng_Latn You can polish our hooves.
eng_Latn I knew once but I've half forgotten.
eng_Latn set to work at the petition
eng_Latn but this loving despot
eng_Latn I went into the flower room and washed my hands in the basin to save going upstairs.
eng_Latn made him fly across the fields towards the village where they were going to hold their festival.
eng_Latn so that small amounts of food could be pushed inside three times a day.
eng_Latn Heh Time for another story...
eng_Latn you must regard me as a plotting profligate
eng_Latn I had soon told my story
eng_Latn Dad was supposed to be putting on a play for the King and Queen but none of his friends have turned up.
eng_Latn instead of standing up made a guttural interrogative sound and pointed up in the air.
eng_Latn Even another Magic Pencil?
eng_Latn he crushed his impulse to turn away.
eng_Latn was bitterly unhappy.
eng_Latn some in their own happiness
eng_Latn Good news, Pug. I think the wind is dropping.
eng_Latn but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible.
eng_Latn I had soon told my story
eng_Latn a mole's track, whose branchings are untraceable.
eng_Latn They re very bookish Pug, but I'm not sure they re a hat.
eng_Latn because I meant what I wrote.
eng_Latn I requested of the hostess, handing her the money.
eng_Latn to which the holder of the warrant replied that
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn what the mistletoe is to the oak, what the wart isto the human body.
eng_Latn then he saw something to make his heart stand still.
eng_Latn each with a granite panther jumping across it
eng_Latn he added, with difficulty articulating the words.
eng_Latn do not seek to tempt fortune a second time.
eng_Latn he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill
eng_Latn I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits
eng_Latn I shut the door again.
eng_Latn I sort of set it free without meaning to
eng_Latn but when we hadn't had a bite since morning
eng_Latn And from the icing at the side of your mouth I also deduce that today is your birthday.
eng_Latn I won't go without finding out.
eng_Latn what drove her like a mad woman.
eng_Latn he was wasting his time.
eng_Latn I have rarely been so distressed.
eng_Latn there now existed but onerallying point, the centre.
eng_Latn he said anxiously.
eng_Latn I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way.
eng_Latn then the horror of utter darkness reigned!
eng_Latn not come into my study?
eng_Latn otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view.
eng_Latn withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy
eng_Latn here another self came in.
eng_Latn it was five minutes to eight
eng_Latn until she proceeded most familiarly to address her family.
eng_Latn at any moment I thought they would burst it open.
eng_Latn folding her gently and protectingly
eng_Latn what quarrel I had with the dress or looks of his domestics?
eng_Latn then was anxious to be delivered that she might know what it was to be a mother.
eng_Latn the father shouted.
eng_Latn you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.
eng_Latn I've still got four hundred and twenty two pages to read!
eng_Latn not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings.
eng_Latn Yaaaay! Amazing! Bravo Well done!
eng_Latn I had something to do.
eng_Latn I took a chance and made my leap early, trying to use my extra strength to win.
eng_Latn he went down that night.
eng_Latn she cleared the back of the saddle in one jump
eng_Latn setting up a humanitarian regime that would take the best from each doctrine.
eng_Latn You see, living here on my ownisn t so bad.
eng_Latn these noises meant no more than the chiming of a dull clock in the distance, marking the hours of the night.
eng_Latn not above forty feet high
eng_Latn I'm saying nothing.
eng_Latn he might have the wherewithal to take her.
eng_Latn for him to punish him for breach of discipline.
eng_Latn but he could no longer do it.
eng_Latn with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully.
eng_Latn No, that s a horse.
eng_Latn felt a pang
eng_Latn throwing it over my head like a collar.
eng_Latn I isn't using wands
eng_Latn I am not trying to egg you on.
eng_Latn I'm afraid there is nothing to find out.
eng_Latn she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep
eng_Latn which I had postponed taking.
eng_Latn he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
eng_Latn take the child in his arms, and flee far, far away.
eng_Latn All your wheels are much too mighty to make tracks like these.
eng_Latn have a telescope at each eye
eng_Latn who perhaps had the least title to either.
eng_Latn he at last arrived at a competent knowledge of what human nature
eng_Latn I induced him to take two of my three thousand ducats
eng_Latn he had doubtless given you the plan of this house
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book... although I liked the one about cavemen pirates in space too.
eng_Latn I called for a directory and looked out the bakers.
eng_Latn therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it.
eng_Latn that's so dreadful!
eng_Latn but when I am in need of that, I hope some one will tell me so
eng_Latn I wonder what he thought when he saw you sitting at the dining room table for the first time.
eng_Latn lemme hug you!
eng_Latn the old woman coming into the room
eng_Latn that there was a puddle in the middle of the street
eng_Latn if I married him, I'd change all that!
eng_Latn send him into the garret till dinner is over.
eng_Latn Sorry, Enid but The Terrific Two have to be heading home now.
eng_Latn that it seemed as if she had done so not for love
eng_Latn I paid better attention later.
eng_Latn the water was a flat calm.
eng_Latn talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right.
eng_Latn introduced him into society
eng_Latn I knew they wouldn't stop running for a very long time.
eng_Latn That rock is very rocky.
eng_Latn no trace of the shreds of humanity I'd managed to cloak myself in remained.
eng_Latn on which he hastened to join him and help him if it were needful,
eng_Latn Wakey-Pug.
eng_Latn took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter
eng_Latn am I no longer at liberty
eng_Latn after which the armies fell into line
eng_Latn I told him they were out of sight, so he come aboard.
eng_Latn but of fortitude and courage they cannot.
eng_Latn I trust that the wearing of a necklace will not interfere with my prayers.
eng_Latn I ended up in the kitchen and decided that maybe comfort food was what I needed.
eng_Latn he had avoided reality in order not to cry.
eng_Latn I look up blearily.
eng_Latn I had nothing to fear, that I should neither be seen nor heard
eng_Latn that you consider him an agreeable person!
eng_Latn you'll say, 'I sure do, mister.
eng_Latn I remarked laughingly on the change in his present circumstances from those when we had both been medical students.
eng_Latn then gazed out of the window again.
eng_Latn I was timidly following her
eng_Latn now thoroughly roused.
eng_Latn I have nothing for you to do.
eng_Latn as for parrots we've seen quite a number ofthem around here in the last few weeks
eng_Latn I ve even tried fanning it with my Napkin.
eng_Latn I hated that she had this unconscious power over me.
eng_Latn All contestants get ready for thegold cup race!
eng_Latn riddled with pain
eng_Latn they merely want to slump into middle age as quickly as possible.
eng_Latn where he had been educated, and had been in the diplomatic service.
eng_Latn whom I had never seen till yesterday.
eng_Latn induces me to hope
eng_Latn he was himself as one dead.
eng_Latn where a muslin curtain partly undrawn in the middle
eng_Latn In the winter it was bare but stood strong against the wind.
eng_Latn perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it.
eng_Latn Whoa! Three little pigs, building ahouse out of sticks.
eng_Latn pecked him for the first time in her life.
eng_Latn I don't want to go with you.
eng_Latn she died three days later, poisoned by her own blood, with a pair of twins crossed in her stomach.
eng_Latn the assertion of our station, in these days, might cause us real inconvenience.
eng_Latn she asks, voice high and fake innocent.
eng_Latn just slid the lid along as soft as mush, and screwed it down tight and fast.
eng_Latn Longer than ten minutes?
eng_Latn somehow it all came together as a nearly perfect friendship
eng_Latn dressed in black
eng_Latn but it now carried her captive.
eng_Latn I've turned his life around!
eng_Latn the case has now been so entirely cleared up
eng_Latn came jogging into the paddock behind the creatures.
eng_Latn which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator.
eng_Latn to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river bank.
eng_Latn as if the self confidence of the gathering had been staggered by a blow.
eng_Latn I mean real fighting.
eng_Latn I'm so surprised to see you.
eng_Latn I don't remember the exact words, but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or working!
eng_Latn I just thought we might have a talk.
eng_Latn but the last link in it was that her husband, in exalting his brother and abasing himself, was not quite sincere.
eng_Latn this is the kitchen
eng_Latn where the enemy was, the long drawn shouts of thousands of voices.
eng_Latn so called apparently by way of sarcasm
eng_Latn with this the worthy fellow brought his story to a close.
eng_Latn abandoned her to her fate.
eng_Latn but as a child I expressed my idea in the naive way recorded.
eng_Latn the same as entre chien et loup between dog and wolf signifies the evening.
eng_Latn Amazing.
eng_Latn he stopped short, his hackles rising.
eng_Latn which will give you fresh courage
eng_Latn I turned to run
eng_Latn thenshe slowly retreated
eng_Latn I'm very sorry about it.
eng_Latn to find some one quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill fated creature is born.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom.
eng_Latn show him how to avert the danger.
eng_Latn scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite.
eng_Latn I might be really good at it, unless I'm not.
eng_Latn someone was sponging his forehead in the dark
eng_Latn I must tell you something.
eng_Latn bracing herself and catching firm hold of one of the bedposts.
eng_Latn she bargained with him and bought me off for thirty thousand silver pieces
eng_Latn with a long oil ladle in one hand, and a still longer whaling lance in the other.
eng_Latn making a bad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum.
eng_Latn because of my yellow passport, which I had shown at the town hall.
eng_Latn when anything might have happened to her!
eng_Latn the sun, away at sea, just breaking through the heavy mist
eng_Latn he traded his book for one that was thicker,
eng_Latn But I'm scared of lots of things.
eng_Latn but in this we may well be wrong.
eng_Latn It's another Fairy Tale Pug. Andthe Big Bad Wolf is in this one too. If we can get him to huff and puff and try to blow the house down he will leave Granny s pizza alone!
eng_Latn waiting for the cold to shake her into another form.
eng_Latn nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir
eng_Latn this time acting a werewolf.
eng_Latn when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night.
eng_Latn I got out of the car and walked.
eng_Latn he looked at her, her clean and shining face.
eng_Latn feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.
eng_Latn Perhaps if you fixed the bridge, it wouldn t fall apart when anyone tries to cross.
eng_Latn but I meant self command.
eng_Latn or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion.
eng_Latn the gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse by some tenacious illness.
eng_Latn caught up a bowl of soap suds
eng_Latn not for any reasons of merit in connection with himself.
eng_Latn that the latter answered him as if he had spoken.
eng_Latn tempers were running high.
eng_Latn because swelling had disfigured her legs
eng_Latn which enabled him to see into the adjoining rooM
eng_Latn on his face and a shamefaced smile.
eng_Latn how he had looked when he slipped it on her finger.
eng_Latn I stopped in my tracks, spinning to face him.
eng_Latn about the old days.
eng_Latn when she had gone through her figures like the others
eng_Latn that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself.
eng_Latn we stood there, each at his post
eng_Latn but they kissed tremblingly, and then they moved apart.
eng_Latn Pug you must distract them while Hugh Deanie and I sneak away.
eng_Latn There be no free rides on MY ship.They must work or walk the plank!
eng_Latn that is, if you want to run with people who have.
eng_Latn you would make me weep, if such a thing were possible.
eng_Latn Well I'm sorry Pug. But you could be the first Pug at the North Pole to do something special.
eng_Latn upon which, they all three faced about
eng_Latn she recognized him immediately.
eng_Latn Dog loved books so much he decided to open his own bookshop.
eng_Latn adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers.
eng_Latn squeaky?
eng_Latn if you speak a word when you're out o'doors with me
eng_Latn I took out, scabbard and all.
eng_Latn I made an awful mistake the first day.
eng_Latn I know a lotta girls dont like him.
eng_Latn with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom.
eng_Latn which was not very difficult to carry
eng_Latn when I remember the promise I made.
eng_Latn though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.
eng_Latn that unless my affection for her were deceiving me
eng_Latn she offered him the flowerpot.
eng_Latn I know my hair is straight, but it isn't as straight as that.
eng_Latn bent over the body.
eng_Latn who was still looking very disgruntled that he'd been using sign language all day for nothing.
eng_Latn as he is now pretty well, is in a hurry to get home.
eng_Latn I have nothing for you to do.
eng_Latn perhaps it saw dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.
eng_Latn his conviction that the bachelor was not the bachelor
eng_Latn I was as hungry as a hawk
eng_Latn I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people
eng_Latn And who is Pyramus. A hero or a villain? I'm quite good at sounding angry. Grrr.(He s not.)
eng_Latn from the earliest days of the revolt he had careully worked
eng_Latn she broke off and burst into sobs.
eng_Latn an eager and curious spectator,
eng_Latn but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.
eng_Latn was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court.
eng_Latn how the gout had left his left leg and gone to his right
eng_Latn I couldn't even say exactly where it used to stand.
eng_Latn though I held him at arm's length
eng_Latn I have loved my misery.
eng_Latn then held it on his knee
eng_Latn I am his son.
eng_Latn Well, off you go!
eng_Latn but he quitted the room directly.
eng_Latn who was apparently on his deathbed
eng_Latn I sat down and asked you to sit down
eng_Latn but another officer was by her side quickly.
eng_Latn had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story.
eng_Latn though he is strange, and grim at times.
eng_Latn we stayed to see it covered.
eng_Latn but I went home with my faith shaken
eng_Latn even if it was only for two minutes.
eng_Latn looking up at him in the shadow, her desire to obtain some slight satisfaction
eng_Latn I can't move in with you.
eng_Latn that the merchant had for his own advantage kept it secret.
eng_Latn that when the knife struck home
eng_Latn he had thrown it into the river
eng_Latn used it wisely or foolishly, according to our natures.
eng_Latn because the house was locked and dark
eng_Latn especially when the lover is in the possession of the object of his love, and
eng_Latn in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that milk and bread.
eng_Latn for, in spite of you and your ass
eng_Latn I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good.
eng_Latn when my crew conspired against me
eng_Latn which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object.
eng_Latn I think we should find out more.
eng_Latn Let's get our wheels buffed instead.
eng_Latn besides, there is good reason to show that it now wants but little of day.
eng_Latn a token so I was too slow to offer her my help.
eng_Latn without demanding honorable reparation
eng_Latn Excellent work Pug. Would you likeme to read your story?
eng_Latn I'm not doing this for you.
eng_Latn I didn't quite hear.
eng_Latn it was worth it.
eng_Latn I don't want to talk about it.
eng_Latn you have your petticoats all damp above and below.
eng_Latn where the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach.
eng_Latn I saw him''she lowered her voice and leaned toward me''change.
eng_Latn Err. I wish to offer an intergalatic apology.
eng_Latn shovelled together, already half forgotten
eng_Latn as where there were many children
eng_Latn defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.
eng_Latn to hide the star at his neck and the garter at his knee.
eng_Latn we heard voices already
eng_Latn let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own.
eng_Latn but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely
eng_Latn a creeping resignation that it was all over.
eng_Latn I knew it came from behind the panels.
eng_Latn because she imagined it contained some further favorable word about the afternoon.
eng_Latn then she slipped down for a knife.
eng_Latn I've got something to tell you, my dear
eng_Latn And finding the way out - look!
eng_Latn he had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.
eng_Latn I would recommend you not to ask for it.
eng_Latn SurelyEathorne would not refuse his own pastor.
eng_Latn came to consult me once
eng_Latn show him in here and then leave me.
eng_Latn an open space, about twenty yards across, with a low parapet.
eng_Latn I congratulate you.
eng_Latn I brought him a mug
eng_Latn I should be miserable all night, and I won't be miserable for you!
eng_Latn Three! Two! One! GO!
eng_Latn I cannot understand why I did not desert.
eng_Latn let us take hold of hands and run.
eng_Latn but this was easily healed, and after a day the old chief was as much with us as ever, and as kind and difficult.
eng_Latn I won't stand here and be insulted.
eng_Latn raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly
eng_Latn the barber executed a full receipt
eng_Latn I glanced at the slide.
eng_Latn so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door.
eng_Latn who first brought the pox into a noble house
eng_Latn my mother and I were well taken care of.
eng_Latn unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff
eng_Latn is that you shall dub me knight to morrow morning
eng_Latn but in this she made a woeful mistake.
eng_Latn Exactly as a planned Dog (BEAT) What did I plan?
eng_Latn waiting for him to get it clear in his head, so he can explain it to me in simple terms.
eng_Latn with his uncle's aid, immediately started in a prominent position in the service
eng_Latn I have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand francs
eng_Latn a tricky operation she would entrust to no one else
eng_Latn he opened the trunk
eng_Latn I am so sorry. It really was all his fault!
eng_Latn at least a dozen demons to each of us.
eng_Latn that the merchant had for his own advantage kept it secret.
eng_Latn but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top
eng_Latn he could not take his eyes off the marvelous portrait.
eng_Latn you might take your own time to speak, or let me speak.
eng_Latn I'm yours for ever
eng_Latn crush a man or two below.
eng_Latn but that's not enough, for you didn't believe me.
eng_Latn you deprived me of liberty, of love, and happiness.
eng_Latn I wish he got a pot of hominy in his pocket.
eng_Latn he stood head and shoulders above the rest.
eng_Latn might quit its abode whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed
eng_Latn The game is afoot!
eng_Latn as to conceive the idea of improving on his method
eng_Latn that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with the daughter.
eng_Latn but that he finally decided against it.
eng_Latn King Arthur and his Knights Of The Long Table.
eng_Latn least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen
eng_Latn as a heavy fire had been opened on him
eng_Latn met the baronet at the bottom.
eng_Latn Unfortunately not Pug. I left itback at the beginning of the story.
eng_Latn Keep ...going ... Pug –
eng_Latn I will demand that her money should be invested in her own name.
eng_Latn And here comes a big mug of tea to wash it down!
eng_Latn but she thrashed again
eng_Latn if it does come, while we live to see it triumph
eng_Latn Then you shall play.. Pyramus.
eng_Latn there is nothing which I shall hold back.
eng_Latn you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to morrow!
eng_Latn never able to get rid of the sour taste of doubt in your mouth
eng_Latn it'll be on your side
eng_Latn Building shelves... FindingElves ..Aah. Seeing ourselves.
eng_Latn or earth nourishment.
eng_Latn belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman
eng_Latn hear me out!
eng_Latn hich within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.
eng_Latn for a light was burning there.
eng_Latn because they were friends.
eng_Latn in order to make room for a tuft of hair, after the style of 1829.
eng_Latn This one Pug.
eng_Latn but he was totally unprepared for the fury of the seething maelstrom they faced.
eng_Latn so much blood gushed forth from him
eng_Latn That was awesome hiding.Can youteach me how to be like you?
eng_Latn We may be able to help you there.
eng_Latn It's a picture of me mum.
eng_Latn after which I saw the sacristan make a low bow to the visitor, and then another bow as the visitor took his leave.
eng_Latn never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
eng_Latn gleamed red along the edge of the pavement.
eng_Latn I must do something.
eng_Latn the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end,
eng_Latn I just thought you'd like some elbow room while you ate.
eng_Latn you have lost nearly 1,700,000 francs this month
eng_Latn was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way.
eng_Latn with one hand leaning on the back of the chair
eng_Latn for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him.
eng_Latn a look of fear came into his eyes.
eng_Latn I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human feet, and some of cows
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer, a magic top hat!
eng_Latn I am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth.
eng_Latn I called you to tell you I fixed it.
eng_Latn wherein all their laws are written
eng_Latn but pushed the thought to the back of his mind.
eng_Latn the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head
eng_Latn then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe.
eng_Latn I didn't know it was like that.
eng_Latn there's something up there that 'll help them think so
eng_Latn sneezed over the first puff, and then began to cough herself.
eng_Latn soaping himself furiously from head to foot.
eng_Latn That is... very different.
eng_Latn he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private person.
eng_Latn but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party
eng_Latn I walked round to the other side of a large bed
eng_Latn the garrison received orders to resist to the end.
eng_Latn the father said, greyer than ever now.
eng_Latn summoned his valet to his own bedroom.
eng_Latn it hung in midair, unsupported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it.
eng_Latn either to speak or be silent just as you please
eng_Latn That s a very good question Pug.
eng_Latn could earn enough to rent a room for the three of them
eng_Latn even to gratify a pretty woman, which is
eng_Latn I lifted my head and kissed him with a passion that might possibly set the forest on fire.
eng_Latn not to be behind the rest
eng_Latn he said and left the room.
eng_Latn but I followed the scent through the house.
eng_Latn naturally, I'll see that you're taken care of.
eng_Latn somehow made her usually soft voice heard above the tumult.
eng_Latn there's enough of that sort of talk.
eng_Latn shook off his hand, and began to walk about again.
eng_Latn always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.
eng_Latn I have a strong intention of defending my person
eng_Latn I will not forbid him the house.
eng_Latn putting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came near to where he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and drew hers through his arm.
eng_Latn he stood on a chair to get them down.
eng_Latn an officer's saber with a sword knot.
eng_Latn And make our shiny paintwork dirty?
eng_Latn I set up and looked around, a little scared.
eng_Latn the police had supposed that he had betaken himself toParis.
eng_Latn for it was an age when magic was feared by common people
eng_Latn I suppose you thought you'd keep the money, if I did!
eng_Latn I am no man's servant!
eng_Latn then a dull, heavy thud.
eng_Latn so that he had no time or did not dare to write anything longer or plainer.
eng_Latn so shall you drink, my boy.
eng_Latn but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men
eng_Latn I was trying to be good enough for her.
eng_Latn This is a book about a place so cold the sun keeps as far away from it as possible. And It's called BRRRRRRRRR! At the bottom of the world thereis a land so cold that water is hardly ever water there at all.
eng_Latn An Arctic expedition will be freezing but fun. This way Pug!
eng_Latn he said and left the room.
eng_Latn I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her from it.
eng_Latn And slowwwwww. I just slap it onfast.
eng_Latn This is a story about some food that was too hot and too cold. And it's called The Big Book of Fairy Tales .
eng_Latn during a party game
eng_Latn but he was engaged with a woman
eng_Latn she slipped her hand into her breast
eng_Latn the general is busy now, but the secretary is sure to come out.
eng_Latn only to wrestle and throw the bar
eng_Latn saw her in that brooding abstraction which made her pose remarkable.
eng_Latn promises that when times were better she would hire free darkies.
eng_Latn I got a han'bill says they need men.
eng_Latn then she lit a cigarette
eng_Latn I ran out of his office and came straight here.
eng_Latn but he went on smoking his cigarette.
eng_Latn Here is where we always are.
eng_Latn the two scourges are one and the same .
eng_Latn not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on which to land conveniently.
eng_Latn night had settled upon the moor.
eng_Latn but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small needle.
eng_Latn which he had adopted as his personal motto.
eng_Latn you don't need to be a genius to tell which one's the better flier!
eng_Latn presently died wholly away.
eng_Latn but the truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used.
eng_Latn Yip! You didn t tell me this was a scary story!
eng_Latn I'm going to get him back.
eng_Latn I should die raving mad if I believed a word of it.
eng_Latn wishing that her parents would stop quarreling.
eng_Latn but there are people whom to have near one is a blessing at such times.
eng_Latn he removed his bed
eng_Latn was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved.
eng_Latn if they stop here we may say gaudeamus
eng_Latn first warning the people below to stand out of the way
eng_Latn I was saying that of course you will break the news to her.
eng_Latn had bent to ask her pardon for the violence of his language
eng_Latn I fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.
eng_Latn to do the master a mischief.
eng_Latn its nurse, and her maid
eng_Latn I'll make the arrangements with customs.
eng_Latn no matter what party was in power
eng_Latn he told of the with drawal of the 28th regiment from the front
eng_Latn but do not fill or empty mine
eng_Latn it is the student's good fortune
eng_Latn unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are enchanters
eng_Latn Grab my paw!
eng_Latn the fat man and the little girl lay awake in silence.
eng_Latn wondering what could be the result of such an infatuation as this.
eng_Latn I found it!
eng_Latn it will seem to you that they are resting.
eng_Latn but she could not find her either in the garden or in her own room.
eng_Latn said the count, bowing
eng_Latn I'll eat my head if he is not a bad one
eng_Latn I can't stand out there that long.
eng_Latn I can give you his address if you want it, and directions.
eng_Latn before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane
eng_Latn but the short flick of yellowish flame in the dusk was powerless against the muffled up mysteriousness of the dark figure with an invisible face concealed by a great sombrero.
eng_Latn stared at the person who had addressed him
eng_Latn that even if that happened and your worship found some such sword
eng_Latn there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites.
eng_Latn but resolutely refused to meddle with him.
eng_Latn every other thought was effaced, and he felt only a profound and unheard of joy.
eng_Latn instead of standing up made a guttural interrogative sound and pointed up in the air.
eng_Latn It's very hot and sunny Dog. Can wego back in?
eng_Latn he felt cold sweat on his face.
eng_Latn I have no idea of that sort of thing.
eng_Latn Oh! Aah! (panting) Aah!
eng_Latn assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done
eng_Latn that a man of character should devote his energies to plotting and intrigues
eng_Latn if you like him to try experiments on your hospital patients
eng_Latn We can all be a bit barking now andthen Dog. But together we will find a wonderful world where your worries will melt away. Sit beside me.
eng_Latn I was surprised no one had hit him yet.
eng_Latn were besmeared with azure and decked with fleurs delys.
eng_Latn to prove it she ran up a long column of figures in her head and gave him an estimate then and there.
eng_Latn doctors disliked and hesitated to even trifle with them.
eng_Latn let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after the bucket.
eng_Latn not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me.
eng_Latn why not fourteen hundred?
eng_Latn he might feel perhaps annoyed
eng_Latn And yukky.
eng_Latn I could think of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting spell on the door.
eng_Latn assured her that he had and didread it.
eng_Latn but for one single instant show thyself,
eng_Latn is it not better to be feared than loved
eng_Latn this fan awakened a recollection
eng_Latn was so terrified at the sight of him
eng_Latn an uncommon beauty who needed only a beard to be hired by a circus.
eng_Latn Now THAT S more like it!
eng_Latn Biscuits on wheels!
eng_Latn sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face.
eng_Latn amid the tears and lamentations of the whole household
eng_Latn how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision
eng_Latn thereupon repeated several times the word _Yahoo_.
eng_Latn ordered them to tow my chest, as they called it, toward the ship.
eng_Latn And this is my recipe room where wecook up amazing new flavours.
eng_Latn the heat of the day, you know'I drifted off for a moment
eng_Latn she hastened from the room.
eng_Latn I went for it, cautious and slow.
eng_Latn Sorry Dog.
eng_Latn I found her crying, on her knees by the bedside.
eng_Latn was a stoutly built fellow of about five and thirty
eng_Latn he set up, with violence, a manly, healthy pessimism.
eng_Latn besides she kept all the keys.
eng_Latn this being combined with the data of a now social economy
eng_Latn but when he put his hand back to reach for the matches I saw an enormous revolver strapped to his waist.
eng_Latn for the orders had all been given and were now being executed.
eng_Latn Well That, and it being in the middle of a very confusing maze.
eng_Latn I explained that I wanted two thousand of them.
eng_Latn it won't be my fault!
eng_Latn as though she hadn't heard him
eng_Latn had therefore leisure to look around
eng_Latn I ain't ever going to shake them any more.
eng_Latn except the captive, and the ladies, who supped by themselves in their own room.
eng_Latn though, naturally, they mustnot interfere with the reasonable profits of stockholders.
eng_Latn but the servants are not allowed above half that time
eng_Latn when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail
eng_Latn Abracadabra!
eng_Latn nothing was said for some time.
eng_Latn but the police proved that it had been there
eng_Latn what they were like
eng_Latn at an age when everything had seemed complete.
eng_Latn had come home.
eng_Latn how is it that it has escaped
eng_Latn all those who took part in the first resurrection
eng_Latn I, of course, threw it all on my destiny
eng_Latn clutching his wrist
eng_Latn but the cowherd would not have her.
eng_Latn the conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent sparring between the brothers in law at a vestry meeting.
eng_Latn the first and last friends that he ever had in his life.
eng_Latn bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it.
eng_Latn his glance wandered away with the stream
eng_Latn the man, who had entered but a moment before me, and was still unpacking his parcels
eng_Latn I realized the stillness meant that it was over.
eng_Latn Famous Faces ... Double Basses ...Secret Places!
eng_Latn feeling cold sweat trickling down behind his glasses.
eng_Latn it is in no way interesting to you to know that.
eng_Latn I think so, because she beckoned to me to climb up, with quite a new and motherly expression in her face, and put her arm round my neck, and gave me just such a kiss as she might have given to her own boy.
eng_Latn eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war canoe of the savages
eng_Latn I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father's wish?
eng_Latn I am the lineal descendant of that infant
eng_Latn at the second he reminded her that he loved her
eng_Latn so now you know.
eng_Latn but make no treaty you understand me?
eng_Latn he recollected the prayers his mother had taught him
eng_Latn suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him.
eng_Latn Is there anything scarier than a monster Pug?
eng_Latn but the priest who was standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him
eng_Latn found that it came to sixty three reals
eng_Latn he has been in contact with decent, respectable, andeven able and distinguished people.
eng_Latn he had lost his only weapon.
eng_Latn Bow-wow-wow-wow-woow...
eng_Latn we feel you're losing your touch.
eng_Latn with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.
eng_Latn he pointed to the door of his office, and stepped aside to let him pass.
eng_Latn I must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.
eng_Latn as he stood there dumbfoundered and moody
eng_Latn I have one here. It's been entertaining some new ideas.
eng_Latn but to tell you the truth, what happened back at the office scared the wits out of me.
eng_Latn or rather, though of different minds, they concurred in action.
eng_Latn I've been promoted
eng_Latn her control came back, and her hand dropped.
eng_Latn rather admiring their own boldness
eng_Latn that a large number of people were assembled on his verandah, which was brilliantly lighted up.
eng_Latn that he meant to take also a very good ass he had
eng_Latn with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a chair.
eng_Latn if the members are obliged to feel the suffering of the head
eng_Latn he was cheerful in thefamiliar simplicities of his office.
eng_Latn I recognized you at once, that first evening.
eng_Latn he obeyed her shout and was silent.
eng_Latn it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding.
eng_Latn but he simply turned his head the other way
eng_Latn you must think it over.
eng_Latn I thought I spat on the ground and left him in disgust.
eng_Latn he must be found
eng_Latn she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure.
eng_Latn in those of fortune, in having many friends, and many and good children.
eng_Latn that always will be so in whatever circumstances I may be placed.
eng_Latn You couldn t see me then Dog.
eng_Latn And it is called Granny Pug sGuide to Thinking About Thinking.
eng_Latn I rest all my hopes on you, and, of course, my whole life is in your hands.
eng_Latn I sort of belonged here.
eng_Latn you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.
eng_Latn turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides
eng_Latn but you'll shoot my dear friend 'rsula in an attempt to pacify your conscience.
eng_Latn I let my head roll back around toward the fresh air and closed my eyes.
eng_Latn Oops. Sorry Dog. I'm doing my magictrick backwards.
eng_Latn you shall not have to reproach me with weakness.
eng_Latn took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.
eng_Latn A balancing book.
eng_Latn I am in a hurry to begin
eng_Latn he ran into the road and waited.
eng_Latn returned to announce that all was quiet.
eng_Latn I don't recall that love was prominent in your other two ventures.
eng_Latn what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind.
eng_Latn doan nobody but bad womens use dat stuff.
eng_Latn without waiting for any sound of trumpet or other signal to direct them
eng_Latn for half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.
eng_Latn that might embarrass me
eng_Latn his neck was almost completely severed.
eng_Latn I turned my eyes from him, fixed them on the fire
eng_Latn but they were frightened to go inside.
eng_Latn I won't keep you long, I won't even take off my coat.
eng_Latn Well... maybe I could teach yourfriend how to paint a portrait.
eng_Latn started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy.
eng_Latn its diameter 7837 yards, or about four miles and a half
eng_Latn in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone.
eng_Latn placed the lamp on the table, and took his gun down from the wall.
eng_Latn all her efforts were directed towards preserving the peace of her last months.
eng_Latn any glimmering of these can only come from a scientific culture
eng_Latn you can tell all about it at the court martial.
eng_Latn cried the young girl
eng_Latn but he had not time to formulate it to himself before he went into the nursery.
eng_Latn because she made his mother cry.
eng_Latn then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals.
eng_Latn I hope to be able to solve that.
eng_Latn under sail we ran more than eight miles an hour without any fear
eng_Latn I believe he is a free mason.
eng_Latn which, after great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity.
eng_Latn instantly she put upon him the compulsion which he hated.
eng_Latn unless some one helped him.
eng_Latn but he saw in her eyes a constraint that boded him no good.
eng_Latn she might almost think that nothing had changed.
eng_Latn I could let him go, but it's the principle of the thing.
eng_Latn partly curiosity, perhaps, and partly as a kind of precaution.
eng_Latn but there is the other one in the background for a journalist of my ability.
eng_Latn the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty three years ago.
eng_Latn attempts to write poetry.
eng_Latn looked out under them.
eng_Latn his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women.
eng_Latn was in a way an early sign of death in the person of his father.
eng_Latn I can t find the brakes!
eng_Latn he was full of vivacious conversation as we went along.
eng_Latn but he had them taken down
eng_Latn And now we re stuck in this mudforever!
eng_Latn but I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman.
eng_Latn as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her
eng_Latn I mean real fighting.
eng_Latn the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women.
eng_Latn I need your help to stop this.
eng_Latn I had waited patiently for the opportunity
eng_Latn who waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall.
eng_Latn didn't have to think or feel anymore.
eng_Latn showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house.
eng_Latn the master called to me to see what was the matter
eng_Latn I dream of him, how he's lookin for us even now
eng_Latn I just don't seem to be able tocontrol myself these days like I once could.
eng_Latn cat like, with bare feet
eng_Latn I just remembered that today's my birthday.
eng_Latn had very little to do with reality.
eng_Latn even the parish registers were in a muddle and so on and so on, ad infinitum.
eng_Latn should be alive
eng_Latn the wedding cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up.
eng_Latn or man's countenance is no longer to be relied on.
eng_Latn Aha! Here they are!
eng_Latn especially since he tried to hang himself.
eng_Latn ready to unload its cargo of death.
eng_Latn Hoooph. Thanks for the ride, birds. Enjoy the sandwich!
eng_Latn I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it.
eng_Latn if it were but two words only, to let him know that all was well with her.
eng_Latn I'm not going to keep secrets from him.
eng_Latn she was only desired not to meddle with things that did not concern her.
eng_Latn expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities.
eng_Latn he had thrown it into the river
eng_Latn on condition that he never attempted to see your mother.
eng_Latn he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage.
eng_Latn with difficulty remembering where he was, and where he ought to walk or drive.
eng_Latn his hand on the tiller had become symbolical to her
eng_Latn but there passed no talk or coffee making for this time.
eng_Latn he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon the bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.
eng_Latn with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface.
eng_Latn the lazy horse walked away with us all at his accustomed pace.
eng_Latn for so long as I am thine
eng_Latn begin his life as an outcast.
eng_Latn because you are still four against one
eng_Latn but perhaps he didn't want another row
eng_Latn that it is impossible to understand all
eng_Latn who fell back with a broken collar bone.
eng_Latn I made it up to add piquancy.
eng_Latn stretching his legs toward the stove.
eng_Latn concealed door behind a painting of a bowl of fruit.
eng_Latn on a bedstead moved away from the wall, there lay covered with a quilt, a body.
eng_Latn she shuddered with loathing.
eng_Latn they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species.
eng_Latn he has left me nothing nothing!
eng_Latn else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.
eng_Latn he had learned, likewise, that the young lady was his daughter
eng_Latn Billy Barker and the Dog Biscuit Factory.
eng_Latn he brought her to me.
eng_Latn I do do duvets Pug, but first we have to find out who is making that..
eng_Latn but I was little better off inside them than as pure spirit
eng_Latn Looks like Pug and the Mice aregoing for the Napping in a book shop World Record instead.
eng_Latn Then perhaps you could help us by telling us what to do?
eng_Latn his energetic mind slumbered
eng_Latn which he had adopted as his personal motto.
eng_Latn going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door.
eng_Latn but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is.
eng_Latn but haggard and old before her time
eng_Latn but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it.
eng_Latn We re on a sailing ship Dog!
eng_Latn The Rise And Fall of The Roman...
eng_Latn part of an ecotage group that had blown a power station.
eng_Latn I glanced over my shoulder
eng_Latn I know I'm not as scrupulous as I should be these days.
eng_Latn to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world
eng_Latn nor could he persuade her to come inside.
eng_Latn suffering from that flu that probably hadn't really been a flu.
eng_Latn I don't want a new career!
eng_Latn I have got fifteen louis d'or in my possession, although I began with fifteen gulden.
eng_Latn I looked up at the waitress, waiting for her to recover herself.
eng_Latn puts faith in you
eng_Latn for in that case the extremities of it, being at equal distance from the earth, act with equal force
eng_Latn an' lick his pencil.
eng_Latn but he'll be here soon
eng_Latn life being now strong enough to bear her on again
eng_Latn I used to brush her hair for her every evening.
eng_Latn it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer.
eng_Latn I mean, you're not supposed to see them, are you?
eng_Latn putting a stink bomb under your desk.
eng_Latn Ohh. This is all rather frantic for me.
eng_Latn the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm.
eng_Latn he felt that the aching place was himself.
eng_Latn ere the first day was done he was pulling more than ever before in his life.
eng_Latn I left it to get riches
eng_Latn fumbled with his cap
eng_Latn it is high time to forgive and forget
eng_Latn now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side
eng_Latn that the emperor
eng_Latn at last he asked him for five pounds.
eng_Latn for he had used seven of his dozen rockets
eng_Latn he knew more of land, building, and mining than most of the special men in the county.
eng_Latn then, overcoming his manifest repugnance
eng_Latn they were quite alike in this.
eng_Latn but she had not an acquaintance in the room.
eng_Latn cried the three girls
eng_Latn but the instant she heard him
eng_Latn until she felt she must leave or fall
eng_Latn I'm the person to judge that
eng_Latn whom he loved as if he were a human being
eng_Latn I was glad to settle down into one of the chairs.
eng_Latn having made this obliging promise
eng_Latn most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own
eng_Latn in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her!
eng_Latn held her tightly.
eng_Latn I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be seen.
eng_Latn you wanted it badly enough to put on quite a show.
eng_Latn I'm sure I shall get over it if you'll only do that.
eng_Latn but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done.
eng_Latn Actually we were going to invite you to afternoon tea.
eng_Latn for whose movements no directions are given
eng_Latn pondered a long time.
eng_Latn he thought of how manydeep and tender things would be hurt if they really couldn't go on likethis.
eng_Latn spent fifteen days in the voyage.
eng_Latn whose life is written by these fingers.
eng_Latn I watched them walk down the hill and disappear behind a wall.
eng_Latn as I rode on, the gloom cleared.
eng_Latn said the prince, and entered the drawing room
eng_Latn he turned his face upon the pillow
eng_Latn And his dogs...
eng_Latn his pounding with the flat of his hand on her bedroom door.
eng_Latn but in the last three years or so he had lain on harder.
eng_Latn I walked round to the other side of a large bed
eng_Latn at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey.
eng_Latn let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day.
eng_Latn with his knife slightly split the end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat
eng_Latn I I was hoping you'd never find out what he did to me, because he's your friend.
eng_Latn Uh-Oh
eng_Latn on which he lay with the written paper open and the pen still in his hand.
eng_Latn I shall escape, that was settled apart from you
eng_Latn leapt up and performed the countercurse.
eng_Latn I would go myself, but you'll know how to do it ever so much better.
eng_Latn I'm solonely and I need somebody to cheer me up.
eng_Latn I had never noticed before.
eng_Latn get a copy ofher marriage certificate, too, and keep it for her own as well asthe baby's sake.
eng_Latn he strode forward to take his sisters hands, beaming.
eng_Latn I hardly liked to ask to go by.
eng_Latn but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.
eng_Latn I'm Camille
eng_Latn I know the ways of ghosts
eng_Latn when all this was observed in him
eng_Latn first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other factors in the situation.
eng_Latn is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring.
eng_Latn one of them whipped ashore and disappeared.
eng_Latn I know I shouldn't speak to you
eng_Latn so let us three go and take it!
eng_Latn convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat might tell us?
eng_Latn it had been decided that the marriage should take place within six weeks.
eng_Latn forbid alike either a speedy marriage or an engagement which must be too lengthy.
eng_Latn never mind if the leak should double on her.
eng_Latn he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
eng_Latn without being able to drag the firm thing from its place.
eng_Latn but of funds which she can well spare.
eng_Latn bowed his head towards her
eng_Latn to come and upset us in this manner!
eng_Latn if you can't see where it keeps its brain.
eng_Latn I cut this difficulty by providing a mount for the new guide from my own beasts.
eng_Latn bent on finishing a plan for some buildings
eng_Latn how different it was from shearing.
eng_Latn the in habitants ofToulon beheld the entry into their port, after heavy weather
eng_Latn one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen musket
eng_Latn their eyes met again, and he disappeared.
eng_Latn the blue suit was too hot
eng_Latn I expected an invite to stay with you at some pretty place.
eng_Latn if I was to set on it long enough.
eng_Latn By Louise Yates.
eng_Latn when it was too late.
eng_Latn pondered, trying to penetrate the full significance of the words.
eng_Latn by this time was beginning to come on oppressively.
eng_Latn for one hundred per cent profit on their goods.
eng_Latn I'm sorry you see us in that way.
eng_Latn I'm sorry I disturbed you.
eng_Latn she must have died almost the moment she retired.
eng_Latn all being assembled in the hall, the priest of the parish came in
eng_Latn so that it was palm up
eng_Latn would have been forced to some dishonorable course, if he had found himself in such a difficult position.
eng_Latn although our entrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all persons belonging to the court.
eng_Latn clash of steel followed, and then a cry of pain
eng_Latn That s funny. I feel like I'm still here.
eng_Latn but here too was the same intolerable silence.
eng_Latn I'm so sorry.
eng_Latn I wanted to come straight back to you.
eng_Latn conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend
eng_Latn I thought all this very pretty and engaging
eng_Latn she was in the same dress as she had worn at the theater.
eng_Latn twenty five years too late.
eng_Latn you may approve again, for grandpapa is again thinking of it.
eng_Latn I'm even weady to dance the pas de chale.
eng_Latn although on the lake the day before he had been deciding
eng_Latn The Emerald Emperor Butterfly isvery rare but it's been spotted round here ... so I need to find it!
eng_Latn I had no idea you were ill.
eng_Latn And you meddled with my map Tina?
eng_Latn I want nothing.
eng_Latn only that mine were all of a colour.
eng_Latn at that the hundreds who had crowded into the hot stuffycourtroom after dinner though many
eng_Latn in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her!
eng_Latn an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men
eng_Latn I don't want either of you to be worried at all.
eng_Latn I'll explain inside
eng_Latn ...nature.
eng_Latn after having exhausted the ideal
eng_Latn the clanking of sabres and spurs resounded all over the building.
eng_Latn three left, three right, and one above the main entrance.
eng_Latn but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him away.
eng_Latn I've been very careful to not think about it when he's around.
eng_Latn the better sort, who could afford it, crowded for warmth and merriment to the city.
eng_Latn had one child, this fellow
eng_Latn he felt it ruffle his hair as it passed.
eng_Latn then another half hour before we git to the main house.
eng_Latn pressed the hand held out to him.
eng_Latn the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial
eng_Latn they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where
eng_Latn Now to find Pablo Picasso, wholives just around the corner in the Rue de Noys.
eng_Latn how he drags those guns about!
eng_Latn don't forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position as you.
eng_Latn but the afternoons were long and dreary.
eng_Latn one near the bottom, one by the top.
eng_Latn fled, with many tumblings and bruises
eng_Latn especially because her raised hand of an archangelic messenger was moving with the swaying of the cart.
eng_Latn for we were young men able to gain our living
eng_Latn I must at least try to be one
eng_Latn this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?
eng_Latn you'll drive yourself out of your mind
eng_Latn There is a word... a special word for when the removal of one rock causes many more rocks to fall.
eng_Latn who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers.
eng_Latn is sorry he had anything to do with me.
eng_Latn I gave him the other
eng_Latn the stream descending the ravine
eng_Latn you forever lose the chance of marrying the other
eng_Latn the expression of his large brows softening
eng_Latn he was hunched, as if with age or weakness
eng_Latn he gave up thinking about it.
eng_Latn but a time may come when this omission can be remedied
eng_Latn it was no use trying to conceal my presence.
eng_Latn I care for no man on earth, no man on earth cares for me.
eng_Latn I am therefore bound to fulfil the expectation so raised,
eng_Latn kissed each of the two large tears.
eng_Latn so give me a cheerful smile as I go out
eng_Latn began to pin her rose in her head dress
eng_Latn he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his clothes.
eng_Latn for what journeys you take, your own feet will serve you.
eng_Latn he would have done anything to escape his happiness.
eng_Latn he reached out to clasp her hand.
eng_Latn but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught.
eng_Latn I think the word you re looking for is Books Dog.
eng_Latn but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded.
eng_Latn The Pole Star, which means...
eng_Latn because swelling had disfigured her legs
eng_Latn It looks like Gaz and Baz have fixed the thing that went wrong with the city.
eng_Latn full of hatred, concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts
eng_Latn where a woman has to have breeding and background to catch a rich husband.
eng_Latn he insisted on going alone.
eng_Latn which exactly suited me.
eng_Latn I was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me silence.
eng_Latn lighting the water pipe
eng_Latn in two months after my return, I again left my native country.
eng_Latn if it had not been for the chart on the companion
eng_Latn Good morning campers. So you wantto go camping?
eng_Latn because, better late than never.
eng_Latn gave a feeble hoot of thanks
eng_Latn Here comes their mother.
eng_Latn which was made of land which had formerly belongedto their community.
eng_Latn it had my cupboard on it.
eng_Latn a wife should be always a reasonable and agreeable companion
eng_Latn said this least of women, trying to fold her short arms, and nodding her large head.
eng_Latn but the two little ones were sitting on a bench
eng_Latn with their work and their good habits, had transformed into one of the finest towns in the province.
eng_Latn saw them admitted by the porter.
eng_Latn now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck
eng_Latn they set off immediately as fast as they could walk, in pursuit of the two young men.
eng_Latn I couldn't see a goodbye anywhere in his eyes.
eng_Latn It was just the naughty bookshop mice playing a trick.
eng_Latn let no lions daunt him
eng_Latn he felt that he must go away somewhere, anywhere.
eng_Latn since nobody dared to annoy one whom he honoured with his countenance.
eng_Latn (LAUGHING) Little Miss mucky truck?
eng_Latn though he by no means knew what it was.
eng_Latn made him fly across the fields towards the village where they were going to hold their festival.
eng_Latn everybody was to know that the property was gone out of the family
eng_Latn he was beside her.
eng_Latn I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself
eng_Latn I'd never heard him be so impolite before.
eng_Latn expected peace only yonder.
eng_Latn then went back again to the beach.
eng_Latn he watched the appearance of nature again
eng_Latn I set up and looked around, a little scared.
eng_Latn marriage won't improve his grammar any.
eng_Latn but the two little ones were sitting on a bench
eng_Latn so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies
eng_Latn glancing into his room, he took out and gave her the thin square envelope of a telegram.
eng_Latn they had warned her what would happen.
eng_Latn no pity or sympathy for him, surely had come up for this dayanyhow
eng_Latn Panting
eng_Latn I am not going anywhere,
eng_Latn to be familiar with the great man
eng_Latn then left me without a word.
eng_Latn from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional
eng_Latn I laid in a stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls
eng_Latn we don't mind how hard the truth is for the neighbors outside our walls.
eng_Latn I hope she stays, that woman!
eng_Latn forgot her flighty conduct and their disapproval of it
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn I felt his surprise and sudden worry.
eng_Latn Go for it, Pug!
eng_Latn she looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated.
eng_Latn I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger
eng_Latn suddenly, with the water, out came the long slimy newt straight into the glass, plopl
eng_Latn a silent presence near my bed
eng_Latn especially when I'm not sure of it, but it seemed like the right thing to say.
eng_Latn I have no seductions now away from home and work.
eng_Latn I want to just get away for a little bit.
eng_Latn all by his tongue, and his ape, and his show.
eng_Latn believe me, every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.
eng_Latn Uh...how, Granny?
eng_Latn which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act
eng_Latn he's debating whether or not to come break up our fight.
eng_Latn scribbled a few lines, and put the note in an envelope.
eng_Latn burn mercury in my room for three days.
eng_Latn she stood a moment to look out.
eng_Latn they had mastered the technique, when of course they would be able to earn more.
eng_Latn This is a book all about sleep, Pug and it's called...
eng_Latn I don t, do I?!
eng_Latn she could not escape.
eng_Latn I only wish I had a home to offer you shelter in.
eng_Latn so hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched unlucky chivalry was in question.
eng_Latn I'll make you promise again, before you go.
eng_Latn I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.
eng_Latn which would hold him all the way home
eng_Latn this tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do.
eng_Latn but they have all snub noses,
eng_Latn feeling a deep excitement that he couldn't explain.
eng_Latn losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies
eng_Latn they did not have any information enabling them to replace it with the true one.
eng_Latn there it teetered for a few seconds before finally toppling over and falling with a sharp tinkle on to the desk top.
eng_Latn his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature
eng_Latn said the magistrate, without any introduction
eng_Latn but there was not, and there could not be, any sort of reason that his existence should be troubled, and that he should suffer because she was a bad and faithless wife.
eng_Latn branchless old willows mirrored their grey backs in the water
eng_Latn I can never enjoy.
eng_Latn knocked three times on the castle door.
eng_Latn he never saw anybody
eng_Latn she pledged her word, and kept it for my sake.
eng_Latn while posterity shall hardly believe them.
eng_Latn I was off to one side
eng_Latn I think you must have dozed off too, dear!
eng_Latn bout this and they didn't hang him.
eng_Latn I had no idea he was having rooms redecorated and furnished.
eng_Latn to let the doctor know the way I took it.
eng_Latn I afterwards failed very narrowly, three or four times
eng_Latn but another officer was by her side quickly.
eng_Latn I didn't expect it in the least.
eng_Latn for the establishment of national self respect without which he declared with energy
eng_Latn if the doctors had not insisted, with veiled menaces, on his taking a long holiday.
eng_Latn but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur.
eng_Latn doors that weren't really doors at all
eng_Latn proceeding to remark on the rare beauty of the day.
eng_Latn Stop being silly, you naughtybookshop mice!
eng_Latn Swab my decks!
eng_Latn there was every reason to believe
eng_Latn this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul.
eng_Latn And everyone went where the Wumpus went, and agreed it was one of the best places they had ever been.
eng_Latn I amsimply stating, as a matter of fact and of law, that this boy wasnot formally engaged to this dead girl.
eng_Latn that you might escape the punishment that you deserve.
eng_Latn I never before knew anybody who was really good.
eng_Latn but it is in the brains, what he has got.
eng_Latn rode slowly towards the harbour.
eng_Latn we'll be the only ones left here if you don't move.
eng_Latn how she would love him become quite different
eng_Latn I shall bear without complaint the pain which my so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me.
eng_Latn Wait! If you re very hungry you can share my doggy biscuit sandwich. I never go on an expedition without an emergency snack.
eng_Latn so he presently found himself leaning to the impression
eng_Latn I love Warm!
eng_Latn their men disfranchised, their women insulted.
eng_Latn he dabbed on cologne and waxed the ends of his white mustache
eng_Latn wherein she was likewise much commended.
eng_Latn Just spiders. And blancmanges. And tiny hats. And...
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn though several persons were there
eng_Latn try the wig in front of the looking glass, turn this way and that before the long mirror on the wall.
eng_Latn Perhaps we should do it together.
eng_Latn yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?
eng_Latn then pushed the paper a little way from him
eng_Latn I stood up and put my bunch of primroses on the gatepost.
eng_Latn well, it was him put her up to narking me.
eng_Latn as to the necessity of unremitting effort to secure the lasting welfare of the country emerging after this last struggle, he hoped, into a period of peace and material prosperity.
eng_Latn presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.
eng_Latn Granny Pug, please pass me your lunch box...
eng_Latn I have a few items at home
eng_Latn we went on through a great noise and uproar that
eng_Latn burying him in dark, damp compost
eng_Latn it so annoyed her she longed to shake the old darky until his toothless gums clapped together.
eng_Latn We ll save you granny!
eng_Latn I can't get out of this room
eng_Latn but there was still plenty of black left in that sensibly netted head of hair.
eng_Latn for he was going to set his engine at work.
eng_Latn I have never interfered in your
eng_Latn religion and agriculture more.
eng_Latn Hello Brain. Is anyone in?
eng_Latn with no dignity, just an animal in a cage!
eng_Latn found him lying on his face
eng_Latn seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily.
eng_Latn telling him he must add to his satire
eng_Latn he dashing to the door to make sure.
eng_Latn desired I would give him a relation of my travels.
eng_Latn until it had no meaning
eng_Latn anyways it don't if she don't cry.
eng_Latn it was not difficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone
eng_Latn at anymoment might approach and so learn the meaning of his arrest.
eng_Latn produces a key and opens a door.
eng_Latn you shall not be friendless while I live.
eng_Latn believing he was laying on the giant
eng_Latn without slowing it down.
eng_Latn I don't recall that love was prominent in your other two ventures.
eng_Latn I just can t rememberwhat!
eng_Latn might pass behind her back unseen.
eng_Latn of being praised by one who is himself a worthy recipient of praise.
eng_Latn I wasn't sure what to expect
eng_Latn I thought we could
eng_Latn My new friends!
eng_Latn And although they were different in all sorts of ways, Dave and Janice lived and played in the jungle together - happily ever after.
eng_Latn I look up as he walks into the room
eng_Latn I remained downstairs on guard
eng_Latn stood with his hand on the back of his wife's chair
eng_Latn were with five hundred guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows.
eng_Latn she had pushed the head back and molded the body with her hands.
eng_Latn desired to see the persons by whom those services were performed.
eng_Latn desirous of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod.
eng_Latn he can't go to the prom either.
eng_Latn put on his still damp jacket and overcoat.
eng_Latn I was happy to be entrusted with the charge. I shall be more happy to execute it.
eng_Latn it shews what a sad invalid I am!
eng_Latn with whom I have to do
eng_Latn I shut my eyes to make the experience more lasting.
eng_Latn I made signs, as well as I could, that I had no occasion for such an instrument
eng_Latn there was a flabby perspiration on the walls.
eng_Latn it gave him directly contrary to my intention a very mean opinion of our understandings.
eng_Latn I set eyes on him
eng_Latn for someone must have been to see him from the police
eng_Latn let the daughter have free advent
eng_Latn rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling.
eng_Latn he turned stiffly, almost stumbling.
eng_Latn which will bring this dreadful tragedy to a close
eng_Latn and not wishing to carry it too far
eng_Latn I found half a dozen grey hairs this morning
eng_Latn shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.
eng_Latn I've got no education.
eng_Latn shading the flame of the candle with his hand
eng_Latn he began to utter profuse and doleful lamentations over her body
eng_Latn found himself gazing into a pair of lamp like yellow eyes.
eng_Latn I don't think we have ever had any breakages in the morning room before.
eng_Latn she dropped to the cushioned seat with a little cry.
eng_Latn she shan't go home!
eng_Latn I get a pint of milk from the fridge and slam it shut
eng_Latn happened to cut one of his fingers.
eng_Latn that death had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that house
eng_Latn so, all who were in the inn being arranged in front of the show, some of them standing
eng_Latn containing the fierce and yet humble appeal of the man against the blind and stupid barbarity turning an honest ranchero into a bandit.
eng_Latn but you will not do so, I hope.
eng_Latn I'm not angry anymore.
eng_Latn a few phrases of the speeches delivered in front of the house
eng_Latn but also because their attempts were premature.
eng_Latn if you will open the shutters for me.
eng_Latn that he watched his opportunity
eng_Latn that he would like to impress on his uncle that he was cut out for something better.
eng_Latn seizing him by the arm he forced him to sit down beside himself.
eng_Latn I'll make you late for school.
eng_Latn then went back to their vicious squabbling over the diminishing feed.
eng_Latn her huge body overflowing the chair she sat in.
eng_Latn that suspicion was the only wise attitude with regard to it.
eng_Latn take up our time an' then walk out!
eng_Latn it was heaven to sink into a soft cool bed
eng_Latn Welcome fellow explorers. We areabout to go on a voyage of discovery - in space!
eng_Latn I didn't foresee that she would be so good for him.
eng_Latn however, I made a shift to creep on all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee side of a border of lemon thyme
eng_Latn what had society said or done
eng_Latn she groaned all night, an' she died the next afternoon.
eng_Latn I shut off the engine and got out.
eng_Latn not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand.
eng_Latn whether she will return to her husband
eng_Latn was replaced by a kind of fascination.
eng_Latn but before doing so she looked inquiringly about her.
eng_Latn but I have a roof over my head, and food and some clothes.
eng_Latn they can't deny that it's my right to agree to this.
eng_Latn just you turn it over, as in dooty bound
eng_Latn sat in the dark in his office, thinking about her.
eng_Latn she felt horrified at her own vileness, horrified
eng_Latn I'll take care of you.
eng_Latn monsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures
eng_Latn I couldn't help hearing
eng_Latn I'll just have to cross my fingers and hope for the best.
eng_Latn I must have taken cold in that nasty damp ride.
eng_Latn when I thought I had nearly done enough,
eng_Latn I had at least twenty girls.
eng_Latn I expressed myself quite sure of that
eng_Latn all the time that you have been talking.
eng_Latn only redecorating and painting the suite in the east wing, which I thought we would use for ours.
eng_Latn that little village yonder on the hill and that church near the gates was his.
eng_Latn OR...just do what this sea monster says.
eng_Latn don't forget the chief point, that I am not now in the same position as you.
eng_Latn you wanted it badly enough to put on quite a show.
eng_Latn they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend.
eng_Latn she felt touched at the name of mother
eng_Latn I don't think he's ever sold a picture.
eng_Latn I guess I see what you mean, though.
eng_Latn then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle's.
eng_Latn in obedience to the doctor's impulse, home they went.
eng_Latn I'm going to do all that for you.
eng_Latn then fell into natural discourse.
eng_Latn a girl may be so circumstanced that she cannot live in the family without humiliation,
eng_Latn whether one carries relics or any secret contrivance about him
eng_Latn let's have a look.
eng_Latn I told her the night she fuss let me sleep in her cellar.
eng_Latn now I know that he's not alone, and that even I am not alone.
eng_Latn but a genuine love of that wild life which he had led in his young days before he turned his back for ever on the thatched roof of the parental tolderia in the woods.
eng_Latn I havent got a single skeleton left to hide from you
eng_Latn that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish.
eng_Latn I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a week.
eng_Latn but in her own fashion.
eng_Latn exploded her husband.
eng_Latn I ve been observing the birds in these nests.
eng_Latn who looked stonily back.
eng_Latn I'm relieved I was dreading the return to school.
eng_Latn maybe your ten or fourteen hours.
eng_Latn be not impatient to answer me
eng_Latn We have to get that hat back Pug.But how?
eng_Latn man, and all of us, were in no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas.
eng_Latn if only he might venture to talk to her more
eng_Latn while indistinguishable figures descended from a wagon.
eng_Latn stayed with her until his death.
eng_Latn I've never heard those words before.
eng_Latn a reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock jaws upon him.
eng_Latn then someone gave a violent shove
eng_Latn I think it was a wonderful prize Pug. All that brain training has given me an idea.
eng_Latn my interest has been diverted elsewhere.
eng_Latn with them good wages, maybe a fella can get hisself a little piece a land an' work out for extra cash.
eng_Latn it's tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon.
eng_Latn which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that nature had given me.
eng_Latn as he shook his head.
eng_Latn after dinner I'll come back
eng_Latn we are such old playfellows.
eng_Latn there were various professional men.
eng_Latn I reacted savagely and said things I didn't mean.
eng_Latn for once he didn't seem keen
eng_Latn I was so far right, that she had no other companion.
eng_Latn but when I was going to bed at night, asked me if I had got that book?
eng_Latn waiting to hear what the argument was about.
eng_Latn but you need to realize that those things specifically applied to me.
eng_Latn was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.
eng_Latn Absolutely. But first let s catchthose bad guys, eh?
eng_Latn so he drank his gin and water in silence
eng_Latn but I am sure he is very uncomfortable.
eng_Latn but he recalled the walk often just the same
eng_Latn with the approbation of those to whom they have been submitted
eng_Latn we had nothing before us
eng_Latn but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed.
eng_Latn adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers.
eng_Latn his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories.
eng_Latn I glanced back over my shoulder at the cove.
eng_Latn if there can be force in a boiler
eng_Latn found he had a fancy for it.
eng_Latn for all his life he had been accustomed to it.
eng_Latn a room magnificent and naked
eng_Latn he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity.
eng_Latn which he had torn to atoms.
eng_Latn turning from the miniature sat down
eng_Latn so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.
eng_Latn Aha! It was under your nose all thetime Pug. You re not taller than me. You re shorter!
eng_Latn you might have a bit of difficulty in believing I ever belonged to it.
eng_Latn both the appeal to the people and the news from the army.
eng_Latn now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
eng_Latn well you wished to conceal your journey from me
eng_Latn wish he hadn't seen that.
eng_Latn tell these gentlemen what took place
eng_Latn out of college
eng_Latn he said anxiously.
eng_Latn as for him, I won't let him go on any account.
eng_Latn looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified
eng_Latn when winter comes without a spring that I shall ever see.
eng_Latn he meant now to be guarded.
eng_Latn who was so small and so thin that he was obliged to load his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind.
eng_Latn for it is legitimate for a poet to write against envy and lash the envious in his verse, and the other vices too
eng_Latn We love them Pug, because they lead to interesting rooms. Come on!
eng_Latn which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother
eng_Latn for it appeared to be plain that everyone expected something of him
eng_Latn I'm not your assistant and I never will be.
eng_Latn I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began to fear his wits were touched.
eng_Latn I spoke because I felt sorry for you.
eng_Latn which had now become the ceiling.
eng_Latn these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life like
eng_Latn as something I have passed, rather than have actually been and almost think of him as of someone else.
eng_Latn he lifted his right foot and then his left
eng_Latn watched two dim blurred pillars that were legs.
eng_Latn dress with a great number of bells
eng_Latn climbed over the gate with the intention of discovering whether it were not sweetbriar.
eng_Latn he rubbed it clumsily over her face.
eng_Latn a savage, solitary place where no civilized creature resided.
eng_Latn I can lie down under them trees an' sleep for a thousan' years if I want to.
eng_Latn Now I can top up the oil and re-light it.
eng_Latn but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame
eng_Latn Poor Dog.
eng_Latn put her in the new part
eng_Latn I felt like I could almost see it, that if I squinted my eyes the right way, I would see it.
eng_Latn said to me, with a sort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant
eng_Latn fear, and the bewildered anxiety to flee
eng_Latn With jam sandwiches, cream cakesand lashings of fizzy pop!
eng_Latn I walked down street a ways and stopped.
eng_Latn when he has come out on the other side of the mud with an ague.
eng_Latn eyes holding mine with such terrible honesty.
eng_Latn I paid sixpence more for my dinner
eng_Latn I have not a penny.
eng_Latn I may have one or two people coming in tomorrow evening.
eng_Latn nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco
eng_Latn she's simply forgotten my existence.
eng_Latn how he drags those guns about!
eng_Latn declared it was time to go.
eng_Latn while underneath the sex is the very opposite of what it is above.
eng_Latn brought his buckler before his breast
eng_Latn I wiped my face off on the back of my arm and tried to fix the dress.
eng_Latn his heart broke
eng_Latn not because he thought well of her husband
eng_Latn kept me awake.
eng_Latn but she clicked her beak furiously and soared up into the rafters out of reach.
eng_Latn I hate when she pulls a face like this.
eng_Latn I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.
eng_Latn so close that he could have put out his arm and touched the dear hand.
eng_Latn but she drew him quickly and firmly away.
eng_Latn looking around to see who had knocked.
eng_Latn the old woman coming into the room
eng_Latn darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
eng_Latn Dog loved the feel of books. Hmmm
eng_Latn faith, if I take to asking questions and answering, I'll go on from this till to morrow morning.
eng_Latn I have brought a spare uniform.
eng_Latn Excellent work, Pug. You have discovered a huge hidden bamboo forest.
eng_Latn who seemed to have realized how important this was
eng_Latn with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
eng_Latn but he now perceived that he had not known real misery.
eng_Latn lovely boy though she must have been
eng_Latn I merely wanted to set your mind at ease.
eng_Latn were cautioned to be mum and wait.
eng_Latn but gradually I got into the way of the thing
eng_Latn who has for twenty years alone borne the heavy burden of grief
eng_Latn I held my hands out automatically, and the filmy white garter landed in my palms.
eng_Latn I don't deserve either of you.
eng_Latn I shut my eyes and tried to remember.
eng_Latn here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!
eng_Latn they had retaliated by teasing him.
eng_Latn where those placards invite one to go, and everywhere and always,
eng_Latn but he was mistaken
eng_Latn patiently waiting for the boys to go home to supper.
eng_Latn but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as he confessed long after to his mother.
eng_Latn the fastenings of the house and everything that could be taken advantage of to make our task easy.
eng_Latn three of the spearhead seeds stuck in the ground.
eng_Latn they weren't allowed to wander off on their own
eng_Latn Well, King Arthur did send us on aquest...
eng_Latn darted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound attention, and perceived a police sergeant standing with his back to them a few paces off.
eng_Latn but somehow it seems as if I did.
eng_Latn perhaps the three months may extend to six.
eng_Latn the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.
eng_Latn they entered, and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow.
eng_Latn the holy mystery of fraternity, symbol of the human fraternity.
eng_Latn dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
eng_Latn but anger had got the better of rhetoric.
eng_Latn I could remember the reason why I'd committed to enduring this unendurable agony.
eng_Latn I came through.
eng_Latn the best he could suggest was that both were to try
eng_Latn now I cain't get her a movin' a tall.
eng_Latn but sheforgot which hand was which
eng_Latn throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside.
eng_Latn an empty chair stood against the wall
eng_Latn (CHUCKLING) Look Dog. They ve drawn you.
eng_Latn I think it is time for story three Pug. The Palace of Malice.
eng_Latn that, except to say what has been already mentioned, he did not open his lips until the other had finished.
eng_Latn but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room
eng_Latn as if the contact stung.
eng_Latn that it covered the whole approach on that side of it.
eng_Latn without his knowing how or in what way it happened
eng_Latn but not as pliant as he thought
eng_Latn besides, the appearance and disappearance ofLouis XVIII.
eng_Latn a windfall, unexpected gold.
eng_Latn for a boy, and altogether jolly.
eng_Latn I should have been travelling out of my brief to have hindered it
eng_Latn from there sent the nation a call to general war.
eng_Latn when the front door opened
eng_Latn I'd almost as soon strike a woman as you.
eng_Latn I expect if we could lay our hands upon that lady
eng_Latn ... I love an exciting adventure story where -
eng_Latn rekindle the fire.
eng_Latn each man with might and main clinging to his seat
eng_Latn when he's through,he don't want no pig hanging around.
eng_Latn Well get her to hurry up. People keep trying to use us to eat their picanics.
eng_Latn Thank you, Colin. And as soon as wehave finished we will leave you in peace.
eng_Latn We just blew it off your head!
eng_Latn if I could only get a hundred jalopies.
eng_Latn which letter put her into the greatest good humour.
eng_Latn I wiped my face off on the back of my arm and tried to fix the dress.
eng_Latn bound together bylong transverse strips of iron.
eng_Latn date it one month later
eng_Latn I just want to have sex!
eng_Latn give over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit
eng_Latn he said and left the room.
eng_Latn it was, perhaps, some plot against you.
eng_Latn you have taken to working without pay.
eng_Latn I give a snort of laughter and hastily stifle it.
eng_Latn I get off here at six.
eng_Latn I must and shall!
eng_Latn but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.
eng_Latn I got this here bearin' loose.
eng_Latn I went up to the window and leaned right out of it.
eng_Latn the red eyed monster that had killed so many people that I'd stop counting their numbers.
eng_Latn somebody was dead
eng_Latn whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out
eng_Latn he would willingly have had that service of exhortation in prospect now.
eng_Latn so that she did not even cry out.
eng_Latn just to see if he'd change in the heat of the building.
eng_Latn I was gonna go tom cattin''an' here I ain't had time to do none of them things.
eng_Latn but he had some difficulty in believing
eng_Latn I advanced forward
eng_Latn that he would be forcing my wife from me
eng_Latn because it seemed to her that he was sick.
eng_Latn It's very shiny moon, perhaps it has just been polished.
eng_Latn those mustering none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
eng_Latn yet she had managed the plantation without men to help her
eng_Latn I suddenly realized what it means for your mother to be lying with seven feet of earth on top of her
eng_Latn a golden afternoon
eng_Latn sat at a distance under the verandah.
eng_Latn but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.
eng_Latn circled one of the nearby flowerbeds, and made a three point landing on a peony.
eng_Latn conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.
eng_Latn he put the bark hastily in his pocket.
eng_Latn for he was later than usual in returning that day.
eng_Latn indeed was at first very terrible to behold.
eng_Latn I just had a dream.
eng_Latn partly in modest propitiation of everybody else.
eng_Latn he leaped from his bed
eng_Latn where it was certainly impossible for any one
eng_Latn I myself had occasion to see this man in 1816 or 1817
eng_Latn I thought, giving up the very last thing I had to give.
eng_Latn I did not realise how motley are the qualities that go to make up a human being.
eng_Latn I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me
eng_Latn if he's poor in hisself, there ain't no million acres gonna make him feel rich
eng_Latn I'm against them
eng_Latn And made your own recipes!
eng_Latn regards itself as a nation, and not as a people.
eng_Latn I missed it right after we got into the wood.
eng_Latn walk till she dropped from exhaustion, and then fall asleep, content with the day's work.
eng_Latn but have the goodness to satisfy me as to this dreadful riot.
eng_Latn that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.
eng_Latn in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made
eng_Latn it was an arrangement between the two women.
eng_Latn that distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor
eng_Latn because they would find him an interesting wild man.
eng_Latn Disappeared?!
eng_Latn the house lay before us.
eng_Latn that the whole affair, carefully prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody
eng_Latn And a muddy place too.
eng_Latn I think less of them now.
eng_Latn waiting for the answer.
eng_Latn By playing my game you re both alittle smarter than you were before.
eng_Latn he headquarters she released the prisoners from the stocks.
eng_Latn don't blurt it out as you did to me.
eng_Latn They do their shopping in rubbishbins?
eng_Latn we, my dears, everything we are and ever will be are just a twinkle in her eye
eng_Latn with her heart turned to ash
eng_Latn recently occupied and temporarily used.
eng_Latn she thought as she got into her carriage.
eng_Latn although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.
eng_Latn a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them
eng_Latn if it were to last till morning.
eng_Latn he selected a mare from the drove
eng_Latn on account of certain commercial speculations
eng_Latn that is no subject of regret at all.
eng_Latn I considered the location, and decided she must have tripped.
eng_Latn waiting for the cold to shake her into another form.
eng_Latn then we rowed alongthe west shore looking for water lilies.
eng_Latn I love him enough that I want that.
eng_Latn a feeling akin to remorse fretted him.
eng_Latn at sight of which he fell back in amazement.
eng_Latn leaving his affairs in great confusion.
eng_Latn Shall we run Dog?
eng_Latn Ninety five ... ninety six ...ninety seven - Ooo! Are we nearly there?
eng_Latn I get closer to him for a moment.
eng_Latn I invited him to supper whenever he wanted to come
eng_Latn I told you that it was all about practice.
eng_Latn then he uttered a high pitched whimper.
eng_Latn resolved to ascertain with particular care who lived in it.
eng_Latn Not yet. But I'm working on it.
eng_Latn sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother
eng_Latn I mean that he warn't never in it.
eng_Latn I must leave him, it appears.
eng_Latn then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.
eng_Latn they showed, with great strength of reason, that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption
eng_Latn embroiled by factions among themselves.
eng_Latn cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master
eng_Latn I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man
eng_Latn he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away.
eng_Latn but he observed it as a curiosity.
eng_Latn before we came forth again
eng_Latn the man who had died or the woman he had left behind.
eng_Latn we can succeed in disciplining anyone.
eng_Latn the pages were soiled and thumbed with use.
eng_Latn if ever that solitary superlative existed
eng_Latn fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it
eng_Latn when he told you he hated her?
eng_Latn but he could not altogether hinder the circumstances of the visit from compromising himself and alarming his wife.
eng_Latn I hope that to lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here.
eng_Latn the rice fields have gone back to marsh lands.
eng_Latn , but on the contrary have benefited mankind
eng_Latn he should both dart the harpoon and the lance
eng_Latn throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside.
eng_Latn since he himself had rendered account of his station and life.
eng_Latn an I think he's an old dear!
eng_Latn three left, three right, and one above the main entrance.
eng_Latn so changed she was
eng_Latn I shall see, now, with my own eyes. I shall see all.
eng_Latn I wondered if there was a way to take his hand without admitting my fear.
eng_Latn he toppled gently onto the grass with
eng_Latn you went out in the hall and shouted for her.
eng_Latn so that cheapened the distinction too much.
eng_Latn who perhaps had the least title to either.
eng_Latn I really do want a little more time being human.
eng_Latn but she probably wants him to herself.
eng_Latn I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.
eng_Latn he will never trouble anyone in this country again.
eng_Latn Umm How curious.
eng_Latn they're going to save us all.
eng_Latn I dial it again.
eng_Latn he loves you with all his heart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible.
eng_Latn but business men are frequently as sanguine and imaginative as lovers.
eng_Latn That looks very...
eng_Latn Ho.ho.ho Brilliant.
eng_Latn but ask me why I think so, and I can tell you nothing.
eng_Latn was pulled low over a face that was small and regular
eng_Latn So where is this Colin then?
eng_Latn fled screaming down the yew alley.
eng_Latn you may lay to that.
eng_Latn stand a look out there, with the same precision as if it had been day.
eng_Latn who had hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.
eng_Latn this week I've been, as it were, looking at myself in a glass, seeing that life, and I didn't like it.
eng_Latn fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.
eng_Latn Indeed it is Pug. The pits arewhere racers prepare for their race.
eng_Latn set off with his daughter to the spring in the greatest good humor.
eng_Latn I think this dog must be very kind.
eng_Latn who nodded encouragingly
eng_Latn Did you just go yip Pug?
eng_Latn left him there alone.
eng_Latn you can't do it on less than two thousand a year.
eng_Latn he said so to his master
eng_Latn the fowls, and even the cattle, together with the whole family of the tenant farmer.
eng_Latn she wrapped him in hot blankets
eng_Latn he swung by the chain of the shoe'the drag.
eng_Latn she loved him
eng_Latn No, it was for a new kind of sandwich. But that s a good idea too. Come on!
eng_Latn but they could not show us much of their skill, for want of materials.
eng_Latn so his self respect is greater than his thirst for money.
eng_Latn literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.
eng_Latn on his word and promise they unbound him
eng_Latn he gave her the same dose as the others.
eng_Latn because I like you and want to save you
eng_Latn I'll change everything here that's not right.
eng_Latn Of course.
eng_Latn Let me in. I want Pigs in Blankets.
eng_Latn which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary
eng_Latn I told him he was out walking.
eng_Latn I for one love it.
eng_Latn as if it were a fly in the soup.
eng_Latn after ten minutes it came into sight again
eng_Latn smelled it again
eng_Latn even if he has to bed them down in the stable.
eng_Latn I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.
eng_Latn because he suspected that she would have informed him that his fly was open in that same tone.
eng_Latn Pass me the figgy pudding, please.
eng_Latn it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron
eng_Latn except that she was so headstrong.
eng_Latn was at the point of ending in tragedy
eng_Latn trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps
eng_Latn but, still, it seemed queer to the prince that he should so abruptly drop a conversation commenced by himself.
eng_Latn cracked her head on the leg of a table.
eng_Latn I have no more than hinted in awkward speech.
eng_Latn dress it as well as I could.
eng_Latn the men were courteous and tender
eng_Latn just then, as luck would have it, entering the harbour.
eng_Latn but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior.
eng_Latn stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind.
eng_Latn I am sure you cannot grudge it to me
eng_Latn I have a night's work to do yet.
eng_Latn I welcomed the opportunity to examine him at my ease.
eng_Latn telling me not to come home.
eng_Latn but, attracting no attention
eng_Latn nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it
eng_Latn You ve been wearing it all the time.
eng_Latn the horse slipped and fell in the mud.
eng_Latn while the evening slowly deepened into night.
eng_Latn bending, kissed her cheek.
eng_Latn Squeaking
eng_Latn for the hair came with the papers
eng_Latn a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes.
eng_Latn to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible
eng_Latn ran at once to aid them.
eng_Latn my precautions were taken.
eng_Latn but so that for the rest of his life he would never forget the sad and somewhat mocking smile of the man being shot.
eng_Latn anyway she's most probably going to be a dwarf.
eng_Latn Ihim
eng_Latn I'm grateful I have others to deal with the tedium.
eng_Latn How curious. I think we re near theend of the book.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! Maybe we could use one of these acorn cups to hide under? Then we d be safe from the ants.
eng_Latn but he adopted the people.
eng_Latn But I don t... and you do!
eng_Latn his reputation being so well established
eng_Latn I'd rather have good health and imagination, he answered.
eng_Latn it was always the same.
eng_Latn follow me carefully, or I may get confused again
eng_Latn I'd hate to see a brother of mine in on anysuch game.
eng_Latn coming to her and kneeling at one side of her chair
eng_Latn then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word.
eng_Latn it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.
eng_Latn I know that, father.
eng_Latn somewhere convenient to either your home or office
eng_Latn he was now determined to keep it and to conduct himself always as his cousin wished.
eng_Latn also, he did not attempt to steal from the newcomers.
eng_Latn then the piece of chalk had lifted itself up and had begun to write.
eng_Latn And so I bid you farewell, seekers of the odd and unexplainable.
eng_Latn folding his arms with such violence thathis clenched
eng_Latn because it seems to me that she is the one who has to decide.
eng_Latn they were left alone.
eng_Latn get laughed at.
eng_Latn when we came out to the car again I saw his car had been drawn up outside a cafe on the opposite side of the road.
eng_Latn I tilted my head toward the blue one.
eng_Latn the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out.
eng_Latn Split up to search?
eng_Latn I leave you, therefore, as I took you, rich, but little respected.
eng_Latn he was adept at spotting a natural born rider.
eng_Latn it took place on that day, on the day of the three temptations.
eng_Latn but have no fear for me.
eng_Latn a reflex response which years of hearing people say this had not scotched.
eng_Latn nor was the heart of any dog.
eng_Latn it might tip off our enemies.
eng_Latn maybe we could start out tomorrow or day after.
eng_Latn SO YOU WISH TO BECOME A UNICORN?
eng_Latn to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement
eng_Latn how sparklingly blue was the sky.
eng_Latn deafen every creature in it, all at one and the same moment.
eng_Latn the longer he stood, the plainer his reflections revealed their blackness through his features.
eng_Latn the one pulled up his ass by the halter, the other his hack by the bridle
eng_Latn that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
eng_Latn there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office
eng_Latn I hath bested mighty armies! I hathdefeated terrible wizards! (MORE)
eng_Latn if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.
eng_Latn You see? Nothing goes right for me.
eng_Latn took a silver key from his pocket
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn that was all easy, so we done it.
eng_Latn looking away to hide her shame.
eng_Latn on the third, he locked his door.
eng_Latn then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle's.
eng_Latn so that he spilled his coffee.
eng_Latn I would gladly eat a bit of something
eng_Latn where it was certainly impossible for any one
eng_Latn I can see the bookshop from here!
eng_Latn she turned away from her, and began gaily talking to the other lady.
eng_Latn it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos.
eng_Latn which may turn out more profitable and creditable to us.
eng_Latn said an icy voice right behind them, and all three of them jumped
eng_Latn the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life.
eng_Latn on the contrary, she turned her back on me and took to flight
eng_Latn I used to be the responsible one.
eng_Latn he shrugged and laughed softly.
eng_Latn (LAUGHING) I want to play again! I want to play again!
eng_Latn without order or discipline.
eng_Latn forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting.
eng_Latn I think the railway has done pretty well by its friends without compromising itself hopelessly.
eng_Latn that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore.
eng_Latn his heart rend in twain, I trow, who saw her once, to see her now.
eng_Latn a slender elf woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.
eng_Latn So Dog tried to keep busy.
eng_Latn but he insisted on speaking to her.
eng_Latn in order to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel
eng_Latn Perhaps we could help you find them?
eng_Latn I went out and breakfasted.
eng_Latn which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.
eng_Latn I feared now to hear my own story.
eng_Latn men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind.
eng_Latn he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question.
eng_Latn my certainty that everything in my life was in the right place tonight.
eng_Latn I'm too old to shoulder the burden of constant lies that go with living in polite disillusionment.
eng_Latn but he is not stupid.
eng_Latn where he was content to lie with closed eyes and analyze his various pains and weaknesses.
eng_Latn Happy birthday Dog. Now you won t be blue anymore - except when you re using your pencil.
eng_Latn rolling his eyes slightly.
eng_Latn I don't think my dad would try to come in while someone else is here
eng_Latn but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him and was instantly admitted
eng_Latn I've got a better idea.
eng_Latn I have nothing particular.
eng_Latn not well observing my shape at first view
eng_Latn Dog, you re much more popular withmini-beasts than me!
eng_Latn they would not be able to spare enough warm bodies to man the plows.
eng_Latn this same dear baby it was truly dear to me, for our mother's sake
eng_Latn then they called out to him that she was on the roof
eng_Latn Yes Pug.
eng_Latn with the help of spectacles.
eng_Latn I think you would do it excellently,' he said.
eng_Latn though I confess I don't think I shall.
eng_Latn Pug the painter!
eng_Latn only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.
eng_Latn who shall be the witnesses of my death before they witness my betrothal.
eng_Latn I was sorry, I kissed her as she was going.
eng_Latn a healthy peasant of thirty and his young wife.
eng_Latn at half past twelve o'clock, after he had wasted the night at the meeting and on the street.
eng_Latn I knew from the way he said it that he loved you
eng_Latn when, as a consequence of a radical taxonomic reshuffle, lepidopterists decided
eng_Latn it was like a change below the surface of water which remains smooth.
eng_Latn which is why I didn't spot it during my previous visit.
eng_Latn I will wait as long as you like
eng_Latn at the heavy knot of hair
eng_Latn after having deeply considered it
eng_Latn you needn't tell that.
eng_Latn to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.
eng_Latn ‘The Hunting Of The Snark.’
eng_Latn I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.
eng_Latn had driven him into an alcoholic stupor.
eng_Latn with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.
eng_Latn for the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who follow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter and dance attendance on them.
eng_Latn I should think he might be, with the trial to morrow.
eng_Latn before her spirits were quite overcome.
eng_Latn I'm not allowed to take gentlemen in there.
eng_Latn Granny Pug! You ve redecorated.
eng_Latn in those times the childhood fears of the night had faded a little
eng_Latn every baby an exotic.
eng_Latn Oh no. This is my fault. My firstbook and now the mice are lost in it!
eng_Latn that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people
eng_Latn who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor
eng_Latn on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home.
eng_Latn then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility
eng_Latn but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me!
eng_Latn he haughtily determined to be worthy of his station.
eng_Latn for a change of tone, a variation of rhythm may mean'a week here?
eng_Latn You re my digger of the day. No, of the week. No, of the year!
eng_Latn then he sat down again.
eng_Latn whereupon the huge creature trod short.
eng_Latn but I was not by any means certain that the fellow would have let you go.
eng_Latn to qualify them for being counsellors both to the king and kingdom.
eng_Latn I don't think I ever remember her serving a customer.
eng_Latn taking up a dim and dirty lamp
eng_Latn then remained fixed, while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.
eng_Latn I'll say it's a doggone shame!
eng_Latn not having yet had the honor of doing so
eng_Latn applied his eye to the keyhole, which wastolerably large
eng_Latn the contents consisting of a dozen gold pieces five or six five franc pieces and some smaller coin
eng_Latn I do believe he s in trouble. Time to jump up and get him down.
eng_Latn I've just reached the edge of the lawn when a shrill voice hits my ears.
eng_Latn I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.
eng_Latn as though she had been waiting for him there.
eng_Latn if they got me some electricity to run it.
eng_Latn each, deceived by the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last.
eng_Latn he may have upset the case altogether.
eng_Latn moreover, I was excited, almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.
eng_Latn Granny Pug s Guide to the World sMost Secret Places.
eng_Latn he bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes
eng_Latn it was evident that he was very much in earnest.
eng_Latn or we won't get decent seats.
eng_Latn he had a sudden longing to insult this fat dandy in some way.
eng_Latn I burned this to prove my love for her.
eng_Latn Can we have another another go?
eng_Latn I've never had a single thing to do with them during eight years.
eng_Latn They did say it was only a theory.
eng_Latn the blue suit was too hot
eng_Latn it took six young dwarves to lift him.
eng_Latn there was not even an attempt at a black drapery over the wicket.
eng_Latn I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder
eng_Latn I don t like this place. It has bigfeet, horrible howling AND no ice cream van! Can you read us home please?
eng_Latn the whole damn lot of it, myself as well.
eng_Latn when I saw my enemy and yet loved him.
eng_Latn Are you ready for another go on your skate board Pug?
eng_Latn put them safely in his pocket
eng_Latn I opened the glove compartment and retrieved the phone.
eng_Latn How curious. I wonder what itmeans?
eng_Latn so into the kitchen he went.
eng_Latn 1 to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation
eng_Latn tracking animals and finding water.
eng_Latn embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
eng_Latn confident in the character and behaviour of the girl who never was born.
eng_Latn I lined up all of the ingredients for a makeshift dinner on the counter, forcing myself to concentrate on the task at hand.
eng_Latn I pulled off my shoes and stockings
eng_Latn placing this poor girl entirely out of the question
eng_Latn the beauty of the flowers, and the taste with which everything had been selected.
eng_Latn laying a brawny hand upon his chest
eng_Latn with these words we each went our separate way.
eng_Latn might have known as much of their language as of her own,
eng_Latn one a beautiful creature of nineteen
eng_Latn I just want you to say if you can
eng_Latn but then it made another rush forward.
eng_Latn Except it was on the top of your head!
eng_Latn is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity.
eng_Latn I still can't stand to look at a bathtub.
eng_Latn it was the smell of gas.
eng_Latn lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.
eng_Latn I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.
eng_Latn I do hope so, because it's tea time. But I have no appetite, whatsoever. Even for favourite jelly and cream.
eng_Latn because she herself had repeatedly appealed to him fora personal inter view in which
eng_Latn pointing with his long hand to the room he meant.
eng_Latn but because she was determined that one day her grandmother was going to come crawling to her.
eng_Latn he would have modestly withdrawn himself
eng_Latn on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache, and left me.
eng_Latn I suddenly found that I could remember every detail of the old sign
eng_Latn Paws off, bamboo breath!
eng_Latn it recurred several times
eng_Latn releasing her hold for the first time.
eng_Latn as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.
eng_Latn although they did not realize it,and there was about them something uncanny
eng_Latn when our turn comes our revenge will be sweeping
eng_Latn he had indeed a thousand anxieties
eng_Latn it made a solid thuk as it hit his body.
eng_Latn but much time had passed and it was nearly midday
eng_Latn loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway.
eng_Latn bought herself a complete outfit of such clothes as women then wore
eng_Latn various schemes to enjoy one another's society.
eng_Latn hidden in a cupboard in the castle
eng_Latn there is still more due to the character of an honest man
eng_Latn but not too uncomfortably good.
eng_Latn I flung myself on my face.
eng_Latn but she put out a hand and drew him into the room.
eng_Latn for everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes, and touched with my own hands.
eng_Latn there was gloom on the face of each.
eng_Latn while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale.
eng_Latn just to show that we don't think any less of him than our friends do.
eng_Latn I'm sure they were Pug.
eng_Latn I reckon you're cracking up.
eng_Latn to invent an easy justification for his surrender.
eng_Latn I said his heaven would be only half alive
eng_Latn Uh... Dog?
eng_Latn which had come to him at an age when it is difficult to start life again and to make a new home.
eng_Latn I guess that's all.
eng_Latn So where do they come from?
eng_Latn Well, I'm NOT scared!
eng_Latn I never rode in one before.
eng_Latn deed and deed and double deed won't.
eng_Latn I took his leg and his eye.
eng_Latn it is the regular method of discrediting the party and casting suspicion upon its doings.
eng_Latn I had no idea it would be so violent.
eng_Latn I shut off the engine and got out.
eng_Latn It looks like you dug up someone s sea-shell garden as well.
eng_Latn after an agreeable drive of almost twenty miles
eng_Latn cold as that of the snow drift I almost stuck fast in to night.
eng_Latn I shall lose my way.
eng_Latn now return to your own room.
eng_Latn leaving the women and children at the fire.
eng_Latn to be followed by a social with games, cake, tea and ice cream.
eng_Latn you might have lit one at this fire.
eng_Latn to yield was out of the question.
eng_Latn where they designed to pass the rest of their lives.
eng_Latn soon left their game and came over to the samovar
eng_Latn if you like.
eng_Latn eyes holding mine with such terrible honesty.
eng_Latn because he is satisfied that it is for a certain person's benefit.
eng_Latn pretty nearly promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.
eng_Latn Today Dog I am doing magic tricks! Take a card. Any card...
eng_Latn I started across to the town from a little below the ferry landing, and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town.
eng_Latn Has it given you any ideas foryour own stories Pug?
eng_Latn nor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me.
eng_Latn but I didn't give much heed to it.
eng_Latn there is no reason why I should suffer the punishment of another's fault.
eng_Latn the bastard kicked me out in such a hurry.
eng_Latn but she implored him to come back every little while
eng_Latn you are aware from whom I come at least so my cashier tells me
eng_Latn where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in my life
eng_Latn who have not consulted me
eng_Latn we're all wearing ours
eng_Latn had awakened in her a curiosity that was difficult to resist
eng_Latn but he pitched on me to be his servant.
eng_Latn Dog, you can read in peace now.
eng_Latn I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded.
eng_Latn send news to his father of his having been delivered and found
eng_Latn harangued it andmade very great efforts to convince it.
eng_Latn I noted the phone number and then stroked the keyboard in rhythm.
eng_Latn for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators
eng_Latn he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table again.
eng_Latn I wouldn't've been able to stand it.
eng_Latn he left two letters for him.
eng_Latn looked at my aunt like an amiable bird.
eng_Latn nor consequently play the bass and treble together, as other artists do
eng_Latn don't touch me don't!
eng_Latn when she got there the cupboard was bare, an' so the poor dog got none.
eng_Latn find me some refuge, and say nothing to the prince!
eng_Latn you don't talk.
eng_Latn as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.
eng_Latn but they continued to exist.
eng_Latn then kissed her sister, whose arms encircled her
eng_Latn I learnt that an artist here took a fancy to him, and used to go and see him
eng_Latn I suppose all I can do is try to avoid him.
eng_Latn the pool had diminished again
eng_Latn when he's had the impudence to show it at the last.
eng_Latn is that you should perish on the scaffold.
eng_Latn my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair.
eng_Latn had to hold back the knot of tears that choked her.
eng_Latn he almost knocked the tray from my hands.
eng_Latn it will twist itself into the same tortured forms.
eng_Latn she was a girl who knew the world and the facts of life, and she had taken the risk with her eyes open.
eng_Latn rekindle the fire.
eng_Latn entering the yards.
eng_Latn I manage at last with a fixed smile.
eng_Latn that he had not shrunk two feet, that the whole decade of the 1980s had not vanished back into time.
eng_Latn that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.
eng_Latn it will one day be required of him.
eng_Latn for, with all the pains they take and all the cleverness they show
eng_Latn then put him back in the wild!
eng_Latn the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned.
eng_Latn A fine thought Pug. Shall we thinksome more?
eng_Latn I've decided openness is better between us,
eng_Latn I know. I do know.
eng_Latn but it must be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his resolution.
eng_Latn Is this the only way to pay forpaint here?
eng_Latn on my account!
eng_Latn I can't see anything about it.
eng_Latn such is the delight of recovering lost liberty.
eng_Latn a prime, well fed beast such as takes medals at the cattle shows, and nothing more,
eng_Latn the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory.
eng_Latn their wages had gone down by a full third in the past two years
eng_Latn between the madness of women andthe madness of men.
eng_Latn bolted to the floor in all four corners.
eng_Latn he means to be more the master under your name than in his own.
eng_Latn suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together.
eng_Latn insisting on waiting for my birthday.
eng_Latn for he did not hold that the baseness of the oppressed was any excuse for that of the oppressor.
eng_Latn all this had so transformed his view of the farming of the land as he had managed it,
eng_Latn No, a book!
eng_Latn did not find in his heart his former love for her.
eng_Latn so that at last we were all crowded together in the left hand corner of the cart
eng_Latn Do you have many visitors?
eng_Latn now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were wearing a dazzling glove.
eng_Latn lasted till the venison was on the table.
eng_Latn double locked it with key and chain
eng_Latn until the licentiate told him to let her have it
eng_Latn but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is de pint.
eng_Latn It was very scary Dog?
eng_Latn there is one by that geranium
eng_Latn without any eminence to entitle them to any fame or praise beyond this.
eng_Latn I hesitated, then turned left
eng_Latn drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.
eng_Latn for she had lashed back then.
eng_Latn To be continued...
eng_Latn When Dogstar Two is alive I will play games like this with it all the time.
eng_Latn for he drank his wine at a gulp and sauntered into the outer room.
eng_Latn but he thought that in time the impulsive young girl would let herself be guided by his reason and experience.
eng_Latn expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him.
eng_Latn he held out the coin to him
eng_Latn no one else had business to bring them there.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know... there are more amazing facts here than people who speak Chinese - and that s 885 million!
eng_Latn how important it was for him to effect his purpose before we were heard
eng_Latn who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.
eng_Latn wrapped it in brown paper
eng_Latn today I quit my job
eng_Latn I am more sorry than I can tell you.
eng_Latn he turned his face on to his arm, and shut his eyes again.
eng_Latn before your worship comes near enough to waken my anger I will send yours so sound to sleep with whacks
eng_Latn I shall ask him what he wants first,' I said, in considerable trepidation.
eng_Latn but they were not the breeches.
eng_Latn fists clenched, anticipating an attack.
eng_Latn a jug of iced pumpkin juice
eng_Latn withal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic and obsolete.
eng_Latn ,and this surely is not vanity
eng_Latn that's a sure sign that something is wrong in this family.
eng_Latn We ll be buried in bunnies!
eng_Latn This is no time for delicious dairytreats, Pug –
eng_Latn which belongs to a bourgeois of the town, who gave it to me, and who only uses it on the thirty sixth of the month never, that is to say.
eng_Latn they sat down.
eng_Latn but not enough for the captain's fancy
eng_Latn we were out of his reach.
eng_Latn much distressed and evidently fatigued.
eng_Latn Oh no. I'm very sorry.
eng_Latn whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed
eng_Latn I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.
eng_Latn he had travelled thus far on his last way.
eng_Latn started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.
eng_Latn he pressed his mouth and flattened his nose against the pane.
eng_Latn they would bear him company.
eng_Latn were two, dated on the night his illness first came on
eng_Latn These are the plains of Spain Pug.
eng_Latn as if the soul were struggling to free itself.
eng_Latn I hadn't frightened the hostess at all, despite my intentions.
eng_Latn I long to compose rhymed couplets upon the poodle of a countess.
eng_Latn he arrived at the place where she was
eng_Latn for justice in their dealings
eng_Latn it should not exist another minute.
eng_Latn who might perhaps wish to attend the funeral.
eng_Latn was seated at the breakfast table.
eng_Latn they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before the fire,
eng_Latn taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper,disclosed
eng_Latn I love you.
eng_Latn where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came
eng_Latn she didn't have to see him.
eng_Latn were really further evidence of hisgeneral earthly sin and guilt.
eng_Latn I wonder what it is?
eng_Latn then all the young clerks in town in a body
eng_Latn he had never mentioned a wife, and he had acknowledged a sister.
eng_Latn I could not make it out
eng_Latn committed an act of sacrilege.
eng_Latn belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman
eng_Latn always innocently busy
eng_Latn AVALANCHE!
eng_Latn so much blood gushed forth from him
eng_Latn suddenly seems the funniest thing in the world, and before I know it, I've started laughing.
eng_Latn for all would go well and turn out as he wished.
eng_Latn I hated thinking of her that way
eng_Latn who are calledmeres vocales because they have a voice in the chapter.
eng_Latn after that fool of a job.
eng_Latn but it is alleged that he grew into something more or less resembling a man.
eng_Latn he looked at me astonished.
eng_Latn but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.
eng_Latn we turned together down the path.
eng_Latn well tended and bordered with stone.
eng_Latn My bottom is getting REALLY fed upwith this! … Right
eng_Latn you know that isn't so!
eng_Latn if thou wert not my full niece, being daughter of my own sister
eng_Latn through which he had passed ten times already during the last hour
eng_Latn Back from where Pug?
eng_Latn drove off upon my new quest.
eng_Latn three cigars in my pocket to help me spend the day on this island.
eng_Latn when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in
eng_Latn that something had happened, some one had blundered.
eng_Latn at the same time no notion of trying to resist.
eng_Latn I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore
eng_Latn it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of exiles which is mutual among them
eng_Latn the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance
eng_Latn when they had done, desired I would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor.
eng_Latn quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himself in your magnificent presence.
eng_Latn then they called out to him that she was on the roof
eng_Latn that he has received the letter, and will come.
eng_Latn knocked three times on the castle door.
eng_Latn I didn't draw a deep breath until I was on an express train coming back.
eng_Latn who's standing by the door holding a glass of wine.
eng_Latn I was sitting there waiting for them.
eng_Latn that was my friends' nickname for me at school.
eng_Latn have no passion to hide or confess.
eng_Latn but I want you to listen to me for a minute.
eng_Latn proceeded to explain all that had been previously explained to him.
eng_Latn for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before
eng_Latn expecting my support.
eng_Latn but she thrashed again
eng_Latn that's the foolishest thing you could do.
eng_Latn but my good intentions were unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from
eng_Latn breathe with the voice of the head deacon.
eng_Latn again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand.
eng_Latn I hope that being in love doesn't make every one ten years younger.
eng_Latn threw it with a hard effort which was but impotence.
eng_Latn tears came into his eyes, and he had to stop.
eng_Latn the doors were propped open to let in the balmy air.
eng_Latn finding it to exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one.
eng_Latn I almost turned around and fell down on my knees and started begging again.
eng_Latn who was wearing his usual sneer.
eng_Latn Hmm When did you bury your treasure MrTwo-Beards?
eng_Latn as to the difference of brains, in quantity or quality, among those who are directors in faction
eng_Latn it is virtually our own judgment
eng_Latn because there was a ridiculous curate in the next parish.
eng_Latn their senses are very sharp and much in advance of their vocabulary
eng_Latn if anybody slept in that room he was just as good as dead.
eng_Latn but you ought not to keep it up.
eng_Latn course I don't mean you'd ever do anything that would put
eng_Latn for the devil himself has carried all away.
eng_Latn I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage
eng_Latn W-what do it want?
eng_Latn I don't seem to be able to get at them to rub them properly.
eng_Latn the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness box.
eng_Latn you would have been taken in
eng_Latn Is THIS your card!
eng_Latn for, as he could not read, he did not want them himself.
eng_Latn AND a musical montage!
eng_Latn but at present I do not see what there is to question.
eng_Latn his right hand pushed the herbs away.
eng_Latn he, too, had his secret heart.
eng_Latn he turned his face upon the pillow
eng_Latn he had determined the site of the shipwreck.
eng_Latn there was nothing to the kid he went over like a candlepin.
eng_Latn I'm telling them you all abducted me.
eng_Latn I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend.
eng_Latn there are always not merely one but several such
eng_Latn said that he had had that honour.
eng_Latn instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him
eng_Latn but to try to put the blame on her sister!
eng_Latn not ten yards further
eng_Latn but I can make this easier for you.
eng_Latn for the first time, unaccountably ashamed of the number of his servants and of the splendour of his table.
eng_Latn I wadded the gray cord up in the palm of my hand.
eng_Latn never have sued thatguy, you bet, unless she had to.
eng_Latn I don't want any silly dance given in my honour.
eng_Latn I think they want to get to the green grass on the other side of the stream?
eng_Latn but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening
eng_Latn the gentlemen balanced gold mounted canes between their knees.
eng_Latn come and see.
eng_Latn flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands
eng_Latn We are bats.
eng_Latn but she chose to keep their relationship on an impersonal, business level.
eng_Latn It is I who have been acting like a machine. Dogstar, sometimes I'm not very intelligent.
eng_Latn I shall not have made any difference to you.
eng_Latn under the circumstances, he had no choice but to answer me.
eng_Latn with such conclusive arguments, and such figures and mathematical proofs
eng_Latn then giving way rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
eng_Latn you made a fine fuss with him when he came.
eng_Latn so that there was no water to be pumped up from it to kitchen or bathroom.
eng_Latn Biph., Ogh.
eng_Latn but when she saw his legs she laughed out loud.
eng_Latn so that among us, it would be little esteemed.
eng_Latn so he could not be as expert in distinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in that element.
eng_Latn I reap not a revenge I would not have.
eng_Latn I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck
eng_Latn having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.
eng_Latn (giggling) Bottom.
eng_Latn I was distracted by a sudden fluttering pressure against the outside of my shield.
eng_Latn the cupboards under sinks ' I've even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock.
eng_Latn well, you see, it all lies in this that this damnable psychology can be taken two ways!
eng_Latn bitter, biting mockery of grey hairs
eng_Latn I suppose you angered him somehow?
eng_Latn when nothing further happened settled her in the crook of his arm comfortably.
eng_Latn de fog dat's been aroun' all night.
eng_Latn why this would give him pleasure
eng_Latn then, clutching the coverlid with both hands
eng_Latn I have loved you so much for all my life.
eng_Latn he stared helplessly.
eng_Latn I fell down a hole and hit my head
eng_Latn I shan't be free till eight o'clock or after.
eng_Latn so everything will be all right.
eng_Latn A magical machine that makes pugsmouse-sized?
eng_Latn the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed
eng_Latn urged her to run after him before it was too late, and he was gone.
eng_Latn Err.like a water pipe.
eng_Latn she asked, her voice low and intense.
eng_Latn proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries.
eng_Latn she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again
eng_Latn right they are
eng_Latn so will have an end without a name
eng_Latn to do something that sounded like making coffee.
eng_Latn returning a little early in the hope of finding her sufficiently detached to permit him
eng_Latn had never been commercially anything more important than a coasting port with a fairly large local trade in ox hides and indigo.
eng_Latn I'm sitting here, my attention firmly on the tea trolley
eng_Latn recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents
eng_Latn but he said it would change if the air blew on it
eng_Latn Why are you riding an ant, GrannyPug?
eng_Latn so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road.
eng_Latn that was something else that happened when we got back to the hotel.
eng_Latn he must have more than that.
eng_Latn cast lots to see who must stay to mind the goats of all.
eng_Latn it was impossible to determine any responsibility.
eng_Latn considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour
eng_Latn toward the door on the other side of the room
eng_Latn his belly cascading over the waistband of his tight bluejeans, determined to not miss a bet, to do all the right things.
eng_Latn he was the last man in the world to frighten his wife.
eng_Latn I am sure your dress must make you feel ill.
eng_Latn that the inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _Yahoos_
eng_Latn I can't be a preacher no more.
eng_Latn he carried nothing but his revery, however.
eng_Latn we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road.
eng_Latn had not in plain words recorded what they saw.
eng_Latn might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.
eng_Latn I think the books need oiling again.
eng_Latn you can now have confidence in me after what I have done
eng_Latn they said this drownded man was just his size
eng_Latn who, however, had raised his hat with mild gravity.
eng_Latn And the oil ?
eng_Latn splendid, and I could not help loving him.
eng_Latn to see how she felt about this new and more complicated method of dining
eng_Latn managed very cleverly to give him the support of her arm he really needed.
eng_Latn a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor.
eng_Latn But I was soooooooo lonely. So veryvery very...
eng_Latn with more rope, which was at hand, he bound her to a chair.
eng_Latn but with eyes still cast down, soon went on.
eng_Latn in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police
eng_Latn I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it a sickly, whining, pining thing!
eng_Latn I took his hands away from his face and looked into his eyes.
eng_Latn I think I'm going to go talk to her before she sees you, I murmured under my breath.
eng_Latn indispensable to hostesses.
eng_Latn I wisht I had five hundred jalopies.
eng_Latn he observed that, too, and took note of it.
eng_Latn Cutlass Cove! I were here before.
eng_Latn it had the vagueness of music and the precision of mathematics.
eng_Latn revealing a smooth, hardwood floor.
eng_Latn the broad leisure of marriage will reveal.
eng_Latn Oh. So... I'm not in it at all?
eng_Latn he found himself wondering which would be the lucky one.
eng_Latn I never, then or at any other time, succeeded in looking like a gentleman
eng_Latn I’m going to find you!
eng_Latn I mean to lodge to night at the inn that is beyond the hermitage
eng_Latn came in and stole a kiss from her while she was busy
eng_Latn but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
eng_Latn I thought it a very strong proof
eng_Latn so there was no bright side to life anywhere.
eng_Latn what form, the pitch dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing.
eng_Latn I have no other friend like her and never shall have.
eng_Latn then I think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him.
eng_Latn It has been a long time since I had any. (Chuckles) Dogstar One here doesn t really count.
eng_Latn We re very happy in our underground home.
eng_Latn the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire
eng_Latn I should never like to return to it.
eng_Latn holding it before him like a bomb
eng_Latn father, save me, save me, let me have some camellias!
eng_Latn promised to get him the pistol next day.
eng_Latn took his sister away into a secluded corner of the cricket pitch.
eng_Latn was on the ground floor, at the back of the house.
eng_Latn landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.
eng_Latn of whom he had heard much
eng_Latn don't go burying yourself alive, or putting yourself where
eng_Latn so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission.
eng_Latn until under his treatment she got quite well and went to work again.
eng_Latn have been sometimes violated by each of the three parties.
eng_Latn you and me'll go to sea again.
eng_Latn thinking that that final decision would put an end to his doubts.
eng_Latn but no sound of a door being opened or shut.
eng_Latn he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave.
eng_Latn stood there in shirt and breeches looking out of the window.
eng_Latn it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine shop, shattered like a walnut shell.
eng_Latn he will have put one thing for another
eng_Latn lotions made with the subacetate of lead, and fomentations of oxycrat.
eng_Latn questioned her as to her misfortune
eng_Latn it was me that blowed on them!
eng_Latn of course, the first chance I have.
eng_Latn keep your companion quiet, or I shall never have done.
eng_Latn I frowned at my homework.
eng_Latn convinced that he was going to arrive on some other day by mistake.
eng_Latn feeling but ill at ease meantime to see what was next to follow.
eng_Latn how much a guy can remember.
eng_Latn let's check how yeh've done!
eng_Latn it was almost three inches long.
eng_Latn Whoops. Now look what I ve done.But I can soon rub that out.
eng_Latn the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.
eng_Latn And so Mrs Hargûşa Şîrîneand the Friendly Forest lived happily ever after.
eng_Latn I don't deserve either of you.
eng_Latn I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
eng_Latn yawned a little bit, and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon, pronounced himself fit for a fight.
eng_Latn he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim,
eng_Latn that's how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen.
eng_Latn Oh! No! Uh!
eng_Latn I lived there once, as a small boy
eng_Latn students in every direction lying about why they haven't done their homework.
eng_Latn wiped the dust off with the sleeve of her shirt.
eng_Latn I turn away and pretend to be studying a poster about AIDS.
eng_Latn but I never presume on the connection
eng_Latn I only had the management of one end of it.
eng_Latn pull out a few of their hairs
eng_Latn for neither could row a boat or swim.
eng_Latn or without thinking about the other
eng_Latn I was one of the last to go out
eng_Latn he can't go to the prom either.
eng_Latn or I may become troublesome
eng_Latn as if waiting on a school bench to hear their final grades.
eng_Latn And if you put facts together you can think up new ideas!
eng_Latn after sending out the cable message for the information of a more or less attentive world.
eng_Latn I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house
eng_Latn observing I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin
eng_Latn I have a night's work to do yet.
eng_Latn I kept, among other little necessaries, a pair of spectacles in a private pocket
eng_Latn for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it.
eng_Latn it is often so with vain persons.
eng_Latn by good fortune was not yet gone out of town.
eng_Latn for it is easy for enchanters to take any form they please
eng_Latn if it had not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so nearly concerned.
eng_Latn I will not forget this, mother, upon my word.
eng_Latn as you may have heard, while waiting outside my office.
eng_Latn break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands.
eng_Latn I can make into hats!
eng_Latn You re welcome to come back anytime.
eng_Latn I told her that when I'd had enough of her she'd have to go
eng_Latn I saw his intent in time to brace myself.
eng_Latn because he knew from the names of their skippers they must have suspect backgrounds.
eng_Latn How curious! This is much more fairy-tale-ish than I expected. But it does have engineering Pug, look over there..
eng_Latn consented to comply with his wishes
eng_Latn I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again.
eng_Latn I am sorry I went to see him and took her, said the old count.
eng_Latn with her magnificent black shawl on her shoulders.
eng_Latn picked body of what had once been a man.
eng_Latn twenty six battalions rode to meettwenty six battalions.
eng_Latn I want to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.
eng_Latn I longed vainly.
eng_Latn Read on. Read on!
eng_Latn then he threw his handkerchief on my lap
eng_Latn who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs
eng_Latn as soon as the sun rose I rose too.
eng_Latn in his house, he cannot be at a loss.
eng_Latn I force myself to meet her unrepentant blue gaze.
eng_Latn looked at it rather languishingly at the bewitching portrait
eng_Latn I think he entered the service
eng_Latn but the army had slept six hours and was moving.
eng_Latn so that the delight of her presence was almost pain
eng_Latn but in the future society it will be perfectly normal
eng_Latn walked to the front door.
eng_Latn some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
eng_Latn Chased by what?
eng_Latn we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea.
eng_Latn want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided.
eng_Latn he must have solid guarantees of some sort.
eng_Latn shifting the rat
eng_Latn whom he has not the courage either to fight or trust.
eng_Latn but would not share the spoil with his companion.
eng_Latn spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it
eng_Latn glancing with some surprise at my friend.
eng_Latn I tell you they're born queer.
eng_Latn I agree with that good man, who never existed, perhaps.
eng_Latn so greatly was I impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man.
eng_Latn But doing magic wrong is all I can do!
eng_Latn Ooo, we have music inside ourselves. I wish I d brought my guitar.
eng_Latn but this evening he took no notice of theM
eng_Latn though the screen of the flesh seemed almost transparent
eng_Latn but only singly and separate, and each one his own way
eng_Latn the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat.
eng_Latn you pawn your watch to buy her a shawl.
eng_Latn they had never before gained tokens of this favor so easily.
eng_Latn I'm not running myself dead for that damn druid!
eng_Latn but she declined availing herself of it
eng_Latn houses and buildings in the major cities.
eng_Latn there being only a few officers
eng_Latn who is as mighty and strong as if made of brass
eng_Latn within his reach was a company larger than anything his father had ever conceived of.
eng_Latn he had not actively assisted in creating any illusions about himself.
eng_Latn was on account of his quality and personal merits.
eng_Latn I'd been too distracted to remember to ask her where she was supposed to meet her friends.
eng_Latn but to all those who had need of him to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.
eng_Latn half in the table's shadow and half out.
eng_Latn because they died with prayers upon their lips.
eng_Latn but she looked, and listened
eng_Latn still, his porter's scent was aroused.
eng_Latn it now unanimously and unconsciously yielded to weariness and at eleven thirty, broke up.
eng_Latn he could not leave it there in the dust
eng_Latn spoke with a new tone of authority.
eng_Latn ask me and I will answer with the utmost exactitude
eng_Latn but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so
eng_Latn so the suggestion of a captured bundle
eng_Latn I'll help you till you can get some work.
eng_Latn I was hope to get it for this emerald.
eng_Latn while you're at it
eng_Latn to be so painstakingly decorated before being led to the gallows.
eng_Latn I should like to have some further proof of it.
eng_Latn almost horrified him.
eng_Latn I heard afterwards, however
eng_Latn where they were to plight their troth
eng_Latn perhaps social disgrace into the bargain.
eng_Latn he said vaguely.
eng_Latn Yeti-nother excellent idea Pug.
eng_Latn give me a few more days to make sure.
eng_Latn a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum
eng_Latn her hands had been tied from making up to him for any unfairness in his lot.
eng_Latn presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.
eng_Latn I shall thank the madg'strates to dispose of this here little affair
eng_Latn took a silver key from his pocket
eng_Latn she realized that some frightful fancy or hallucination had seized upon him, and that, for the moment, he was at its mercy, body and soul.
eng_Latn not from what he said, but the voice that said it.
eng_Latn putting out her hand behind her, held mine in it, until we came near to where he was standing in the garden, where she let mine go, and drew hers through his arm.
eng_Latn we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that
eng_Latn there in the centre lay the unhappy maid
eng_Latn one of the upper teachers
eng_Latn for I now began to be tortured with thirst.
eng_Latn but to insure this you must rely on me.
eng_Latn or, if she will not, or cannot do that
eng_Latn because, unless for some such reason, carrying saddle bags was not very favourably regarded among knights errant.
eng_Latn I don't care.
eng_Latn I hope I shall have nothing to do with clerical disputes
eng_Latn who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew
eng_Latn he was eight days more pondering over this point
eng_Latn I face mine enemies naked
eng_Latn from whom he has received no obligation
eng_Latn where she now stood looking at him
eng_Latn against me alone and against my eyes is the strength of its venom directed.
eng_Latn lingered on the matting, that she might leave her husband quite free.
eng_Latn yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him
eng_Latn when she suddenly felt that HE ought to feel ashamed, and that she was ashamed of the same thing.
eng_Latn yet she turned and passed her hand through his arm.
eng_Latn to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the leveret.
eng_Latn In The City ... A Town Called Malice ..Aah. Going Underground.
eng_Latn because it was his turn to bring donuts.
eng_Latn in fact, he did not notice the offered hand.
eng_Latn he did not need to turn around to see her in his imagination.
eng_Latn that everything vanished from her thoughts, even the stone.
eng_Latn I love a good mystery ...
eng_Latn without the three drops I gave you
eng_Latn It doesn t have to be. If you (Minotaur) show us the way out, and you (Thessie) do your extremely clever wool-trail-thing, then everyone who wants to come in for tea and cakes, can follow the wool.
eng_Latn I hadn't heard any sound from there for a long time.
eng_Latn where the knight will find her with the princess her daughter,
eng_Latn he said so to his master
eng_Latn I have no desire to quarrel with anyone.
eng_Latn They have put one in!
eng_Latn I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved.
eng_Latn Would you like a tour?
eng_Latn I have important business elsewhere today
eng_Latn death by the hands of the mutineers.
eng_Latn or as if the soul of the warrior, when he has an army
eng_Latn I gotta see them folks that's gone out on the road.
eng_Latn I am afraid not, Pug. That s your Derek s Dog Biscuit Shop loyalty card.
eng_Latn if this were death
eng_Latn with that he winked
eng_Latn You mean stabilisers?
eng_Latn I don'tknow about that idea.
eng_Latn to this he added more to the same effect
eng_Latn punctually followed the directions he had received
eng_Latn finally fallen asleep
eng_Latn I felt a sort of shiver down my back.
eng_Latn whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.
eng_Latn which was opened with great ceremony
eng_Latn Oooh We re going to find out what it is aren t we Dog?
eng_Latn but made no sign.
eng_Latn inclining her head to catch the words
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn which was watched over by the six soldiers.
eng_Latn until the train turned a corner
eng_Latn as the ship was now, in a sense, my own
eng_Latn I have no other friend like her and never shall have.
eng_Latn benefactions on all sides and everywhere.
eng_Latn with very especial care.
eng_Latn it is a fancy you have taken in your head
eng_Latn he struggled, and the man hit him
eng_Latn yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.
eng_Latn for, after the previous night's experience, he was afraid of losing it.
eng_Latn I have an idea...
eng_Latn but she put out a hand and drew him into the room.
eng_Latn thought that this man of delicate and melancholy mind, physically almost a cripple,
eng_Latn he didn't do it, he didn't do it!
eng_Latn Yummy. Thank you. Oh, it's so nice not to have to shout to be heard!
eng_Latn but you a young lady now and needs a good maid
eng_Latn I beg the reader to note this from the beginning.
eng_Latn a feeling akin to remorse fretted him.
eng_Latn had then vanished, and the madwoman had become a corpse again.
eng_Latn I would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible.
eng_Latn casting about quickly in her mind for some topic of conversation that would put off the bad moment when the subject she feared would come up for discussion.
eng_Latn stepping barefooted and straight as an arrow, with braids of raven hair, a thick, haughty profile
eng_Latn dug a deep hole, and buried it, still in its cage.
eng_Latn I pulled out my keys and reached over the top of him to open the back door.
eng_Latn as if it contained other worlds.
eng_Latn even should he be unable to return to the monastery that night.
eng_Latn but at having failed to control himself and being drawn into argument.
eng_Latn I am always manly, but this is awful.
eng_Latn I am no man's servant!
eng_Latn at twelve the the oh, heavens
eng_Latn she tapped with a gloved hand for the porter to unfasten it for her.
eng_Latn to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives.
eng_Latn I love -
eng_Latn when he entered
eng_Latn we had shoved off and given way.
eng_Latn attention to his words, and perfect reliance on their truth.
eng_Latn I have to go home he said
eng_Latn this fresh misfortune of beingforced to flee by night
eng_Latn I sighed as he disappeared, moving too fast.
eng_Latn which seemed to magnify her own
eng_Latn Now we have sweet potato andseaweed salad, banana and pineapple fritters and milk from a freshly cracked coconut.
eng_Latn but we couldn't do anything more for you at the time.
eng_Latn you ain't well a bit
eng_Latn stretched my arm to draw the curtain.
eng_Latn there was a ladder leading through a trap door to the garret
eng_Latn it depends what trees and what men.
eng_Latn the doctor tells you.
eng_Latn then it were far better to die rather than to sink from greatness.
eng_Latn so that I could storm away with my pride and indignation.
eng_Latn but it was a menacing accident.
eng_Latn emerging next to the gargoyle in the darkening corridor.
eng_Latn a time when these strange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion
eng_Latn to tell him the show was now ready
eng_Latn nay, must even thank him.
eng_Latn ... I love books that tell me about the world outside –
eng_Latn came in and stole a kiss from her while she was busy
eng_Latn that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy's hands.
eng_Latn Shame about my kite. I ll never be able to mend it now. Look. All the sticks are broken.
eng_Latn I know that at the end of two years I shall be on the highroad to success.
eng_Latn he had risen from bed with great difficulty
eng_Latn I do like duvets.
eng_Latn if this were death
eng_Latn as he met it with his own, she glanced, I thought, at me.
eng_Latn she had a remarkable ability for manual work
eng_Latn I thought I was not to look a gift horse in the mouth, sir.
eng_Latn I itched to be back so that I could fill that role for as long as possible.
eng_Latn I was reading a book to night, to wile the time away
eng_Latn DORIS IS BRAVE!
eng_Latn but he might be rendered unhappy
eng_Latn because I meant what I wrote.
eng_Latn I've a mind to take the watch back.
eng_Latn but, first tell me
eng_Latn especially because she would order for the children their favorite puddings
eng_Latn though indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.
eng_Latn This is fun!
eng_Latn who answered him.
eng_Latn I turn on my heel and start striding across the road again.
eng_Latn the new sun in her firmament.
eng_Latn Thank-you Super-Puppy. You re the best!
eng_Latn but which history has noted only once
eng_Latn I mean, as if he wasn't already the perfect boyfriend
eng_Latn I bought you a present too.
eng_Latn that he paid the fare thereof ' ere the craft did sail.
eng_Latn so I am sure that you will not refuse me.
eng_Latn last night he had awakened briefly
eng_Latn there are a good many hours between this and to morrow
eng_Latn I want to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.
eng_Latn also it was nearly as cold as outdoors.
eng_Latn no part of her body was giving her particular misery
eng_Latn I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit.
eng_Latn I'll have to look elsewhere for allies.
eng_Latn not let the army get discouraged.
eng_Latn I don't want a new career!
eng_Latn the travelling is at an end, and you have nothing to do
eng_Latn the certainty that the money would be forthcoming
eng_Latn I only want to be consulted sometimes.
eng_Latn she has only been offered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we occupy
eng_Latn I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.
eng_Latn on the contrary
eng_Latn not sure what to do.
eng_Latn stronger and older stallion
eng_Latn all joined hands
eng_Latn had almost dropped asleep
eng_Latn the shop was not closed
eng_Latn Oof Oh… Granny Pug!
eng_Latn as if the readers were personally concerned whether we fare well or ill.
eng_Latn I tried all day two days.
eng_Latn except when my father, and his too, were from home
eng_Latn so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today.
eng_Latn how far off he must be already!
eng_Latn took' and kept'her hand in both his own.
eng_Latn when a tremulous voice interrupts me.
eng_Latn but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king's death
eng_Latn as if waiting on a school bench to hear their final grades.
eng_Latn then let me die.
eng_Latn I wish to know all about you, you interest me very much!
eng_Latn perhaps, and no other difference.
eng_Latn but only because he was so tired and full of food.
eng_Latn presenting the point of his sword to his eyes
eng_Latn she is so worn away.
eng_Latn I come out of the kitchen
eng_Latn I got up and offered her my seat in the arm chair.
eng_Latn which he took at once.
eng_Latn leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
eng_Latn he first stood and then seated himself
eng_Latn he haughtily determined to be worthy of his station.
eng_Latn Pick on someone your own size.
eng_Latn And I ve imagined it full ofbiscuits!
eng_Latn I don't know whether I can tell you about myself or not.
eng_Latn made me very honourable offers.
eng_Latn we start walking along the pavement again.
eng_Latn he took his seat beside the driver.
eng_Latn I must obey my own,' she replied,
eng_Latn counting the business as good as settled
eng_Latn I bet she never told you that in bed.
eng_Latn as the twins forced the sweater over his head
eng_Latn Hello, My name is Dog and thisis...(to Pug) PUG!
eng_Latn I just remembered that today's my birthday.
eng_Latn Well, that was easy!
eng_Latn I took leave of my master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my heart quite sunk with grief.
eng_Latn but he enjoyed the way she cringed.
eng_Latn Mr Sherlock Holmes I presume?
eng_Latn until under his treatment she got quite well and went to work again.
eng_Latn rsula wept in consternation.
eng_Latn since these,all of them, were the veriest servants of the law.
eng_Latn I am very impressed.
eng_Latn What is the problem Pug?
eng_Latn there was nothing to the kid he went over like a candlepin.
eng_Latn I was disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart.
eng_Latn mayhap, who knows, even fall in love with him.
eng_Latn that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams,
eng_Latn one beautiful ungloved hand pillowed her cheek
eng_Latn touched the glass with it
eng_Latn I never doubted some woman might be found
eng_Latn I meant all this Dog. Why is there a bookshop when there wasn t one before?
eng_Latn when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors.
eng_Latn he was not diminutive
eng_Latn the last car in the crew dropped all five
eng_Latn the biggest she had ever had and a rush order at that.
eng_Latn waited in silence for him to finish speaking
eng_Latn you had better throw the stuff away.
eng_Latn It's play time!
eng_Latn as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in her
eng_Latn any time I want, it does a fella good to cuss if he wants to.
eng_Latn was alien to the existence of his sons
eng_Latn but because he knew that the enemy was beaten
eng_Latn I took from my pocket one last detail.
eng_Latn I know just exactly how you feel.
eng_Latn Bow-Wow-Bunga!
eng_Latn is nothing absolutely good or bad in itself
eng_Latn swallowing a glass of brandy
eng_Latn I grab his arm and try to lift him up
eng_Latn it was marching on six immensely long, hairy legs
eng_Latn he did up a hundred francswhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll
eng_Latn advancing to where he was sleeping tranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening
eng_Latn as if we were bound for the house
eng_Latn you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.
eng_Latn I pulled my hand free so that we could race back.
eng_Latn if you can ever so little, the thing's as good as done.
eng_Latn swung her up against his chest and sat down in the chair
eng_Latn again she was roused as usual by something incongruous.
eng_Latn the preacher went on.
eng_Latn who was at that time away at the front, though she was expecting him soon to return.
eng_Latn I must remember how you said that.
eng_Latn I rise to my feet and stride out of the room, breathing hard.
eng_Latn I yesterday engaged a servant
eng_Latn I hoped that sort of thing could be arranged.
eng_Latn but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie
eng_Latn asked her how that trunk had come into our hands, and what there was in it.
eng_Latn more masterful than crafty
eng_Latn however virtuous he may be.
eng_Latn I wonder that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!
eng_Latn broad backed horse.
eng_Latn he believed that, should a woman be so unfortunate as to have such unladylike comprehension, she should pretend not to.
eng_Latn while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed.
eng_Latn but as soon as he had asked the question he noticed that it should not have been put.
eng_Latn without any scene from which she did not return with the same unperturbed keenness of eye and the same high natural color.
eng_Latn he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles which divided us.
eng_Latn I ought not to rejoice in the misfortunes of others.
eng_Latn but the standard of cooking remains the same.
eng_Latn he disappeared when you arrived.
eng_Latn or because someone made him?
eng_Latn I must admit, that such cases certainly must arise.
eng_Latn he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.
eng_Latn the water cascading all around him.
eng_Latn I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.
eng_Latn I shall pray for youthat you live, and succeed.
eng_Latn but before he could do anything else
eng_Latn I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients.
eng_Latn some from her own common sense.
eng_Latn Well, Dog is very good at helping.
eng_Latn still, there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes.
eng_Latn Ooo, a video game Dog. All those little dots are about to hit that triangle.
eng_Latn Top of the world Dog!
eng_Latn or that he the old prince himself would die before then
eng_Latn thought that I ought to read something 'improving
eng_Latn or else punish me so I'll be afraid to do her again
eng_Latn we may be able to save her.
eng_Latn still, there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes.
eng_Latn I've never told anyone I'm scared of flying.
eng_Latn but he had said of that particular woman
eng_Latn she had never since the age of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste
eng_Latn I wish I could lay my hands on the wretch.
eng_Latn though she need not have left me that
eng_Latn I put it off to the last.
eng_Latn it's no use now.
eng_Latn took a little of the excitement out of me.
eng_Latn his head was heavy, his eyes, his ears, all his senses were dumb and throbbing.
eng_Latn he added, with difficulty articulating the words.
eng_Latn could neither be led nor driven any further.
eng_Latn uttering a whimpering yet clear cry and then falling forward in a faint.
eng_Latn he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery.
eng_Latn they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud.
eng_Latn the visit is to last but an hour.
eng_Latn many of which died at sea
eng_Latn I'm old and I'm scared and mostly I'd just like to lie right here on the home place.
eng_Latn she yanked the garter into place.
eng_Latn I was hoping he might have forgotten.
eng_Latn And a famous one.
eng_Latn I and my life are like a young man and his betrothed.
eng_Latn I sure will.
eng_Latn I was there.
eng_Latn don't blame your own mother!
eng_Latn the opening of the court.
eng_Latn the bunny costume
eng_Latn when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of his country
eng_Latn but he felt too much excited for it.
eng_Latn no informer to watch my words and actions
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat might help?
eng_Latn all about it.
eng_Latn his hands were tied.
eng_Latn I can see that I'm going to have to expel as many of you as possible as soon as possible to save myself from going round the bend.
eng_Latn I've been moping in the house all day
eng_Latn every captain is provided with it.
eng_Latn I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty
eng_Latn I wandered back again into the hall.
eng_Latn that disturbed you, madame,
eng_Latn that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition
eng_Latn when over thirty four years of age
eng_Latn what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter
eng_Latn reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination
eng_Latn so that they could one day attract desirable husbands.
eng_Latn he could not bear any one else to have a place in his master's heart.
eng_Latn because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy
eng_Latn until they left off, of their own will.
eng_Latn conning the terrain of her past and the landscape of her heart.
eng_Latn the countess has only to wish it
eng_Latn I feared I should have to come down and fetch my property myself.
eng_Latn I am not afraid of what any body can do.
eng_Latn remained silent for some time.
eng_Latn but think it over carefully.
eng_Latn so also, just before reaching that point
eng_Latn I couldn't see.
eng_Latn replied the father, I am much colder than that.
eng_Latn that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him.
eng_Latn than under the circumstances she feared he would be.
eng_Latn but neither did the other horseman, well known to the people, keen and alive on his well shaped
eng_Latn began to pin her rose in her head dress
eng_Latn except he might not understand.
eng_Latn I fear it is not an ideal gardening environment.
eng_Latn but for the moment he was in a very good temper.
eng_Latn my spirits were depressed.
eng_Latn a launch sped out, and three hours later returned.
eng_Latn Big Digger...Bigger Digger...
eng_Latn the sight of the she wolf made my stomach twist with nerves.
eng_Latn but he was wrong
eng_Latn Wait for me!
eng_Latn I wondered if she was making a fool of me.
eng_Latn wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable mantle on her arm.
eng_Latn though of a superior station in her set, since she was so very attractive and her parents possessed of even more means
eng_Latn pass the time, if I were sure to live for ever.
eng_Latn I'll bring it you directly.
eng_Latn wasn't even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes.
eng_Latn the two at once left the house
eng_Latn I dart after it.
eng_Latn looked him full in the face.
eng_Latn fetch her in case of contumacy.
eng_Latn I don't see why you should.
eng_Latn she groaned all night, an' she died the next afternoon.
eng_Latn the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her made her heart throb
eng_Latn he was horribly shaken
eng_Latn I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep.
eng_Latn I ran out, too, but was too late to follow them and help in the rescue of the stranger, whose animal had fallen.
eng_Latn Aha! Thenyou must prove yourself worthy to sit at my long table! Bring me a dragon that breathes fire and flame! I want a new pet.
eng_Latn when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within.
eng_Latn just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head
eng_Latn the great confidence I repose in thee!
eng_Latn in the presence of her chief confidents could not forbear vowing revenge.
eng_Latn I don't want you to have to make sacrifices for me.
eng_Latn I'll get picked up for indecent exposure.
eng_Latn sworn to as being identically the same hand writing.
eng_Latn I want to be human a little while longer.
eng_Latn I wish to know if, in demanding my signature
eng_Latn whereby knights errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread if they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms.
eng_Latn a quiet sea.
eng_Latn I am afraid we re near ofthe book Magic Pencil. I have a bookshop to run.
eng_Latn do you know what you did, unfortunate adviser?
eng_Latn he got cataract and had to go into the workhouse.
eng_Latn as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which
eng_Latn his head inclined in the direction of new noises.
eng_Latn I should like you to think sometimes of me.
eng_Latn having been often reduced to hard fare in my life
eng_Latn without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive armour,
eng_Latn entirely, he considered, the fault of his horse.
eng_Latn a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.
eng_Latn but once we hit the treasure
eng_Latn I heard a rustling there.
eng_Latn perhaps, a lad to keep him company.
eng_Latn for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked.
eng_Latn I'm sick of the sight of you.
eng_Latn already her mind is occupied with his fortunes.
eng_Latn galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.
eng_Latn I can't imagine you without five or six in reserve.
eng_Latn I'm the one to feel shame and I do.
eng_Latn she consented to marry without reservation of property.
eng_Latn impudent where he might be allowed to be easy.
eng_Latn I'll take it an' I'll ram it up your ass
eng_Latn but he might be rendered unhappy
eng_Latn Oh Look
eng_Latn here come three together
eng_Latn but there was still an uneasy feeling in his eyes as he looked at her.
eng_Latn Goodbye Art. Hello tourists!
eng_Latn moved them before they could be blotched.
eng_Latn it will bring bad luck.
eng_Latn to what temptations he will be exposed!
eng_Latn the air might keep them cool.
eng_Latn I confess I do not want to.
eng_Latn nothing around them seemed changed
eng_Latn Wow-bowzer!
eng_Latn decided to take the rest of the day off.
eng_Latn he has no claim on my charity
eng_Latn I intend that you shall have it.
eng_Latn it's our fault he's here in the first place.
eng_Latn left to the tender mercies of church wardens and overseers
eng_Latn as these lawyers, by the description I gave of them
eng_Latn not 'nother mouthful, and discovered that he was againtasting the sickly welter of melted ice cream on his plate.
eng_Latn he stopped under a lamp post and read the letter again
eng_Latn in a great field near the city of twenty miles square.
eng_Latn since you wouldn't let me go in the army.
eng_Latn which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles
eng_Latn a dry crackling was heard.
eng_Latn a single crash of thunder made the earth tremble
eng_Latn each drover had two or three droves to look after.
eng_Latn each of her fingers had a migraine headache and the daylight had begun to take on
eng_Latn I won't disturb their happiness.
eng_Latn I'm too old and senile to protect the world any longer.
eng_Latn in the taste displayed in furnishing, and in the rapidity with which it was executed
eng_Latn we just need to find a story to fit it
eng_Latn but as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof
eng_Latn perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence
eng_Latn for whom all words are dead that are not kindled by love.
eng_Latn at three in the afternoon he was still waiting for it to clear.
eng_Latn catching some hairs painfully in the knot.
eng_Latn for he said his father had divided his property among his three sons
eng_Latn we left the doctor endeavouring to recover him, by the same operation.
eng_Latn Acting?
eng_Latn you look like a lady now.
eng_Latn but when he heard that the cardinal was going to pay him a visit this very evening
eng_Latn but this attitude of silent and open eyed attention had marked him out for a victim.
eng_Latn that I received it as a thing wholly new
eng_Latn Not that way?
eng_Latn hearing the well known shaking at the garden gate.
eng_Latn I'll bring it you directly.
eng_Latn he was still not sober enough to carry it through.
eng_Latn perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.
eng_Latn I remember reading a book once.
eng_Latn the glow just strong enough to see by.
eng_Latn since she has neither knowledge of the painting nor any assets that I have been able to uncover.
eng_Latn the loss of a sum of money becomes almost immaterial
eng_Latn while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man
eng_Latn on the third, he locked his door.
eng_Latn I can't rest till I get hold of him.
eng_Latn transformed again into the black dog
eng_Latn I guessed that he was ready, like me, to act at a second's notice.
eng_Latn I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured.
eng_Latn now it was a whirlwind.
eng_Latn it concerns you.
eng_Latn said that he had had that honour.
eng_Latn as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones
eng_Latn How do you distract a rabbit?
eng_Latn until the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well
eng_Latn thanks to her, he could continue in virtue.
eng_Latn push up his visor to mop his sweating face.
eng_Latn wrote it down, and took a minicab from the front of the airport building.
eng_Latn feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour.
eng_Latn You forgot your lunchbox. We were worried you were going to get hungry.
eng_Latn I am free and happy once more, thanks to you, she said.
eng_Latn I AM the Magic Pencil, as I havesaid before. I love to draw and draw and draw and draw....
eng_Latn it was evident that he was very much in earnest.
eng_Latn I won't say a word to anyone.
eng_Latn I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward
eng_Latn kiss me kiss me kiss me.
eng_Latn I was disappointed when she reached her car before she had to pass me.
eng_Latn I doubt it.
eng_Latn but yesterday he looked at me in such a way that a shiver went all down my back.
eng_Latn bright sunshine and clouds interspersed with a few welcome snow storms.
eng_Latn he wrote hastily in the porter's room, so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting place.
eng_Latn but the idea was as I say.
eng_Latn but actually in the hope that another love would cure him of the one that did not allow him to live.
eng_Latn I have discovered a bit of a candle here, and we must take the risk of a small light to make a course by the boat compass.
eng_Latn with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed.
eng_Latn (CHUCKLING) You need a wheely ladder!
eng_Latn nevertheless, we started out with one hundred and fifty men and a huge train of empty pack camels for the spoils.
eng_Latn I think I'm going to last at least five years longer.
eng_Latn I said you didn't really want to come.
eng_Latn you will perceive the divine mystery in things.
eng_Latn burst with our buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup.
eng_Latn who are successful and are sure of the recognition of their success by everyone.
eng_Latn I will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that.
eng_Latn but I decided that was nonsense.
eng_Latn that'll throw the dogs off the scent.
eng_Latn mules were hitched, their heads bowed against the cold misty rain
eng_Latn his arms splattered with white paint.
eng_Latn the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the public.
eng_Latn for there were snakes swimming in the pools or clustering in knots around their brinks.
eng_Latn he poured too many drops into the glass.
eng_Latn I know I look
eng_Latn I glanced up in surprise.
eng_Latn forgetting everything but her fingers on my skin.
eng_Latn I love books!
eng_Latn I like dog biscuits. My favourite dog biscuit is the Crunchy Boy Puppy Pretzel. I also love the Bow Wow Snappy Snack.
eng_Latn the fact that theunintentional blow still had had anger in it angry dissatisfactionwith her really
eng_Latn but her determination was not to return.
eng_Latn emitted a funereal shriek.
eng_Latn called in ancient times the temple 'of all the gods,
eng_Latn if they did not see that I am under orders, and that 'you are a messenger, my friend, no blame belongs to you.
eng_Latn another thought struck me.
eng_Latn I took apiece of crumpet and divided it between the two dogs.
eng_Latn tried to guess who was the visitor who had come with his brother.
eng_Latn having herself examined under a fictitious name by the banana company doctors.
eng_Latn I'm the servant girl.
eng_Latn you'll see nothing to provoke you.
eng_Latn that in order to indicate to us the greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the whole of that history, as long as it is truthful?
eng_Latn men required to secure his personal safety
eng_Latn but couldn't I be of use to you?
eng_Latn screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head
eng_Latn with a glance at her father.
eng_Latn she could not do other than deal tenderly and pleadingly with him.
eng_Latn it's unseemly for you.
eng_Latn I will never do it!
eng_Latn I remember him then.
eng_Latn she found the sidewalks just as crowded as they were at the height of the war
eng_Latn hardly was his head laid back on the pillow than he went to sleep.
eng_Latn then folded them all up again carefully.
eng_Latn it has been waiting round the corner there since ten o'clock.
eng_Latn Wait a minute. If I'm not very much mistaken isn t this bamboo?
eng_Latn he resolved to absent himself from his house for eight days
eng_Latn I love books that make me go-
eng_Latn 1830 is a revolution arrested midway.
eng_Latn nature, he was sure, would manage best, left to herself.
eng_Latn I AM the Magic Pencil and this iswhat I'm for. I love to draw and draw and draw and draw and draw and draw!
eng_Latn that he had to take great heed to keep his tears
eng_Latn the first time in an ordinary tone, and the second time with the greatest prolonging of the words of which I was capable.
eng_Latn Yes please Mr Biscuits. We haven thad a snack in ages!
eng_Latn he pulled out an enormous peacock quill.
eng_Latn that angel resembles the one I have lost.
eng_Latn I'm different because I'm not so good looking myself.
eng_Latn I got a book, and pretended to read.
eng_Latn we should want you to help work the vessel home.
eng_Latn went to see what was going on.
eng_Latn I take it he's got a thing for guns
eng_Latn or else an idle whim is going to spirit me away.
eng_Latn as it dropped
eng_Latn other people said she really was at heart the highly ethical being,
eng_Latn I was afraid he would notice that my hand was shaking.
eng_Latn I had waited since half past eight
eng_Latn in relation to which document he had a notion that time was beginning to press now, and that it really must be got out of hand.
eng_Latn as if within herself she was marshaling every resource she possessed not to scream.
eng_Latn right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door ' and it was locked.
eng_Latn the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor.
eng_Latn look at my brothers.
eng_Latn it was singular that a woman of that age should flush so readily.
eng_Latn perform those other actions, which will be recorded for ever in the chronicles of that empire
eng_Latn then he sat down again.
eng_Latn I can make this right if you give me the chance.
eng_Latn leaving his seat and his pen
eng_Latn my waist and arms I measured myself.
eng_Latn knew the rules of the hunt well
eng_Latn for a good woman does not win a good name merely by being good
eng_Latn upon which, they all three faced about
eng_Latn she could hardly have mentioned a deficiency in him.
eng_Latn wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed.
eng_Latn until eventually I became so irritated that I decided to play the boor.
eng_Latn because we've got to win today
eng_Latn you slug hell out of them
eng_Latn unless upon the score of trade, or treaty
eng_Latn It sounds like she s in trouble.
eng_Latn according as these medicines should operate, repeat, alter, or omit them, at the next meeting.
eng_Latn there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all.
eng_Latn I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries
eng_Latn he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him
eng_Latn his mama had taken him home for a month or two
eng_Latn I folded the paper
eng_Latn a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.
eng_Latn begged her to take the message at once.
eng_Latn but could not believe the strange order
eng_Latn I do it in the name of my dead father, who was a good master to you
eng_Latn I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and his generosity.
eng_Latn I looked with him.
eng_Latn Snow?
eng_Latn perhaps some faintness actually attacked her.
eng_Latn I wouldn't shake my NIGGER
eng_Latn each swearing to what she or he alone saw or heard.
eng_Latn why had he allowed that doctor to go!
eng_Latn waving to apress boy who was near gave it to him together with the money.
eng_Latn to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you.
eng_Latn a preference which I never believed him to deserve.
eng_Latn but anger had got the better of rhetoric.
eng_Latn I heard a very warm debate between two professors
eng_Latn without a tombstone
eng_Latn I told them everything just as it was.
eng_Latn I woke up last night in a cold sweat and I just thought to myself, if this is true, the world doesn't make sense any more.
eng_Latn dressed in full mourning
eng_Latn I thought at the time what a picture it would make.
eng_Latn I want nothing.
eng_Latn remained at the other end of the room, and sat singing to herself.
eng_Latn Is there nothing you miss?
eng_Latn Oh, they re not stars at all Dog.They re rocks spinning through space. But when they get near the Earth they heat up so some people call them...
eng_Latn getting off his ass briskly
eng_Latn but the afternoon sun hit him full in the face and she had to close it again.
eng_Latn if by any mean
eng_Latn but I hope it's really hurting him
eng_Latn I am going to need a bit of huff and puff. (BLOWING) Almost. Eh Heh. Almost.
eng_Latn I'm going to be unladylike.
eng_Latn Does this look like a castle costume OR a cardboard box?
eng_Latn his gold eyes watched me warily.
eng_Latn it was like a change below the surface of water which remains smooth.
eng_Latn not to admit anyone who was not on that list?
eng_Latn What a jumble Pug.
eng_Latn who was his sister, and ten years his junior.
eng_Latn This is a book all about conjuring tricks. And it is called...
eng_Latn But it was soooo exciting Dog. Andnow I'm excited too! Can we read another anthology.. please?
eng_Latn I heard a noise just over my head, like the clapping of wings.
eng_Latn it wasn't hard.
eng_Latn which he took at once.
eng_Latn had ended in laming himself severely by catching his leg in a rope that overhung the stable board.
eng_Latn eave us alone for a moment.
eng_Latn with the same fanatical fearlessness with which he had gone preaching to bloodthirsty savages, devoid of human compassion or worship of any kind.
eng_Latn I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!
eng_Latn I fancied there was in his tone a slight note of exasperation.
eng_Latn without waiting for any more of his questions, he whipped on his mules.
eng_Latn but it was a pity there was no one standing by with a stopwatch.
eng_Latn she held him a foot's pace from her and looked him up and down.
eng_Latn if only he did not need to marry her.
eng_Latn he knew about it beforehand.
eng_Latn I am too ill
eng_Latn but her purpose down here was already completed.
eng_Latn but let us walk
eng_Latn but you will get over that with practice.
eng_Latn the contemplation of life and conduct through the lens furnished by a purely sectarian creed.
eng_Latn Good. Because I'm on a mission. Tofind the Lesser Spotted Kraken!
eng_Latn I wanted him dead.
eng_Latn I panted, quite breathless with quick walking and alarm.
eng_Latn if you attempt to intercept their movements.
eng_Latn that I've never heard some of the words before.
eng_Latn then looked up at us with the set, rigid face of a desperate woman.
eng_Latn it was only the prompt intervention of a gardener that saved her.
eng_Latn a third with a stone raised to throw at the ravens who sat
eng_Latn in hearing the son read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his father's death
eng_Latn ready to run away
eng_Latn I am much too insignificant for that.
eng_Latn I was the monster that dwells in somewhere.
eng_Latn according to the present practice in my own country
eng_Latn but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love.
eng_Latn or living any other life, for that would be alien to them forever.
eng_Latn I haven't been able to think of anything else. I haven't slept.
eng_Latn a strange little voice said hello.
eng_Latn by separating the several parts
eng_Latn Dog, do we have any bigger books on camping?
eng_Latn I think I could probably make some arrangements by then.
eng_Latn I'm not bisexual, either!
eng_Latn like a sailing ship set adrift.
eng_Latn BOWW
eng_Latn I dial it again.
eng_Latn but, however, in return for his favours
eng_Latn I was not half afraid at the time of its being so,
eng_Latn all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved.
eng_Latn the fact that he knew her mistake.
eng_Latn (laughing) Now it looks just like the real thing!
eng_Latn though I saw it cut off with my own eyes
eng_Latn a high and holy person like that looked on it as an honour!
eng_Latn You can t fool me Doctor Badd! Take off that silly mask!
eng_Latn of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened
eng_Latn rising with the letter as if he would put it in the fire.
eng_Latn but a short time only had elapsed when a noise he heard behind him awoke him
eng_Latn still it was pleasant to him to hear this now.
eng_Latn even if the messenger were not killed which he very likely would be
eng_Latn his face a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment.
eng_Latn I was timidly following her
eng_Latn that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer!
eng_Latn so I made this my first stop.
eng_Latn took the covers off in such a bouncing manner
eng_Latn I've been storing things back there
eng_Latn the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation.
eng_Latn as though he'd been hit in the face.
eng_Latn this is not a place to sleep in.
eng_Latn Are you crew? I could do with crew.
eng_Latn And Picasso s new style, which he called Pugism... for three days, before changing it to Cubism... made people see the world in a whole new way. The end.
eng_Latn commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to bear it on a pole upon their shoulders.
eng_Latn or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.
eng_Latn he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible.
eng_Latn when we agreed to camp again in the valley bed.
eng_Latn for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the moment
eng_Latn I'll cure myself of this.
eng_Latn BE a sport and let us in!
eng_Latn I just wasn't capable of letting her go.
eng_Latn before I could get spirits enough to creep out of my cave, the day was far advanced.
eng_Latn added a cup of instant coffee with a lot of cream and sugar
eng_Latn they will be friends
eng_Latn no longer keep her whole attention.
eng_Latn then, clutching the coverlid with both hands
eng_Latn you showed me those notes just now to convince me.
eng_Latn but a determined woman.
eng_Latn consoling herself, however, with the discovery, which her keen eye soon made
eng_Latn he must be a man by this time.
eng_Latn but the task he had begun had to be completed.
eng_Latn I used to have a very poor opinion of him too
eng_Latn I sawed it up and down four times.
eng_Latn I have the misfortune, to have been deceived in my married life,
eng_Latn the hour, the circumstances,the surroundings,were in keeping with it.
eng_Latn in penance for some sin of yesterday, pushed away the hassock and knelt on the bare stones.
eng_Latn so the thing had better be with me.
eng_Latn interestingly barren and without importance.
eng_Latn the path to their destinies, and to happiness.
eng_Latn we have nothing more to do but make good our retreat
eng_Latn I thought you said you were the chief?
eng_Latn I tried to ask him who did it
eng_Latn in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken, and I shall not be there.
eng_Latn addressing the letter in a disguised hand.
eng_Latn beside me she had seemed tall and gaunt, but she looked shrunken now in size, more wizened
eng_Latn ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture
eng_Latn I'll bring it in.
eng_Latn he located the right door
eng_Latn anything might happen, she felt.
eng_Latn unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff
eng_Latn she added, evidently still afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giving evidence.
eng_Latn the good things he had eaten or would like to eat.
eng_Latn she reckons we've got to find treasure.
eng_Latn but no one dared to stir.
eng_Latn worried and suddenly more frightened than before.
eng_Latn yet my meaning was easily known
eng_Latn that was what the house stood in need of.
eng_Latn startled and not tracking very well.
eng_Latn so loudly that his voice echoed all around the cave
eng_Latn was easily accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste
eng_Latn her mind had strayed to other associations.
eng_Latn Umm. Inheritance Tax ... Playing the Sax ..Aah. Fun with Facts!
eng_Latn Far better to give King Arthur something he really needs.
eng_Latn I dont much care whether its inside, outside, or halfway between.
eng_Latn I am the good and faithful servant who brings water in the desert
eng_Latn I wish somebody mess
eng_Latn I imagined what the cab of that truck would smell like, and then quickly drove out the thought.
eng_Latn but when he put his hand back to reach for the matches I saw an enormous revolver strapped to his waist.
eng_Latn I reckon it's wrong
eng_Latn he has spent the night in drinking himself to death!
eng_Latn glided back out of the room.
eng_Latn that they will never be capable of using their freedom
eng_Latn I suppose you just let it out for exercise
eng_Latn he scuffing one foot and looking unhappy.
eng_Latn I warn't easy myself, but I didn't take my hat off, all the same.
eng_Latn I shall make something of you.
eng_Latn even on two occasions when her husband was not on a trip or at the market.
eng_Latn because you can't understand him or his kind of love.
eng_Latn he's not a critic at all.
eng_Latn cynical amusement in them
eng_Latn she set off at a gallop, leaving me to toil in the rear.
eng_Latn I have as much delicacy as anybody else.
eng_Latn his good wife met him in the entrance hall and drew him into his private sitting room.
eng_Latn I'll give you a chain for it
eng_Latn in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time.
eng_Latn BOW! WOW! ZAH!
eng_Latn if only their future relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one.
eng_Latn that neveragain as before could he desire to marry her.
eng_Latn her eyes filling with tears
eng_Latn a large, pink, very masculine hand, with thick fingers and a fleece of gold hairs upon the back.
eng_Latn all are equal in the grave.
eng_Latn bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off.
eng_Latn traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences.
eng_Latn could neither be led nor driven any further.
eng_Latn grinning, my next move would be to sue you for at least a quarter of a million.
eng_Latn there was still lightenough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom ofthat yawning pocket.
eng_Latn he went down that night.
eng_Latn I just felt her frowning at me, thinking.
eng_Latn that for the first time I shall have to show all I can do.
eng_Latn I felt sure you'd like to have the latest news of her.
eng_Latn back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now.
eng_Latn she had jumped up and tried to come to him.
eng_Latn staggered off speechlessly hugging a huge unpicked rib in triumph to its breast.
eng_Latn or how a point could be disputable
eng_Latn Pug, why did you hide all of OUR doggy biscuits?
eng_Latn the men and women had separated as in church.
eng_Latn I ain't seen him since he was little.
eng_Latn I only wish I could thank you for it.
eng_Latn ask about some socks.
eng_Latn always somebody to give orders
eng_Latn I trusted you.
eng_Latn with her needle drawn out to its thread's length.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! I think I ll be in this story soon.
eng_Latn I am doubtful about leaving of you,you see.
eng_Latn I have it still, in my missal.
eng_Latn encountered the personage who had received me last night.
eng_Latn but he had quickly found he was unable to sympathize with their problems.
eng_Latn his guitar case in one hand, his free thumb in his mouth.
eng_Latn to begin the morning's work.
eng_Latn Morrel did not wait for a second invitation
eng_Latn Don t Panic Dog. I ll find it!
eng_Latn probably this basket with pink ribbon.
eng_Latn he muttered and he rushed into the entry.
eng_Latn they sat down on two small chairs opposite each other, with their knees touching.
eng_Latn began deliberately to worm his way into his good graces.
eng_Latn was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood.
eng_Latn Booo !!
eng_Latn it's unseemly for you.
eng_Latn glittered in the sunlight, and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.
eng_Latn I sense the creature changing.
eng_Latn above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room.
eng_Latn Granny Pug had left her lunchbox the beach whilst she was researching a new edition of Granny Pug s Book of Beaches .
eng_Latn but no longer
eng_Latn she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both
eng_Latn of which had during the last eight days filled his mind with so many gloomy thoughts and bitter recollections
eng_Latn rolled over on his back
eng_Latn I took it very carefully in my arms.
eng_Latn to express their wonderment at the ascent of the enormous balloon
eng_Latn I fished out fourpence, and put his cross on my own neck
eng_Latn whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased.
eng_Latn it is impossible to allow less than two thousand francs for pocket money.
eng_Latn had secretly disobeyed it.
eng_Latn so he smuggled out some hundred dollar plates that were supposed to have been destroyed
eng_Latn she nodded again and let go.
eng_Latn said only that he had never been sick in his life.
eng_Latn therefore told her, without any reflection upon her husband's unhandsome behaviour, that she need not frighten herself,
eng_Latn herself the unit of weight and measure.
eng_Latn but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it.
eng_Latn I think you do this really wellDoris.
eng_Latn has never been well since.
eng_Latn I'm not strong enough
eng_Latn sniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal.
eng_Latn I shut the door softly, and went uncertainly along the corridor
eng_Latn all the fishing tackle hung.
eng_Latn I stared at her face and tried to think of some way to make the future bearable.
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous.
eng_Latn all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished.
eng_Latn laid on the very couch he had so feared of late.
eng_Latn be thankful it is nothing worse.
eng_Latn I've been meddling and making arrangements for them.
eng_Latn his chair before it was over.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book! And now I know why snails have shells.
eng_Latn there was a good deal of talk among them in the language of the country, not without some laughter at my expense.
eng_Latn A journey to a place where thereare more questions than answers.
eng_Latn though neither tall nor graceful.
eng_Latn but no one dared to stir.
eng_Latn yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.
eng_Latn I am sure it almost killed me once.
eng_Latn Are Snarks scary Mr Bellman?
eng_Latn as I measured it myself in the royal map made by the king's order
eng_Latn this gentleman doesn't want to remain in my company or else he'd come at once.
eng_Latn but it did not affect his love for her, nor her love for him.
eng_Latn which had been the family mansion for over a century
eng_Latn And never were lonely again The end.
eng_Latn finally succeeded in bringing up a camera.
eng_Latn I'm not ordering anyone to do anything.
eng_Latn but he did not move from his treetop.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat might help you...but we ll have to find it first!
eng_Latn Umm Uh Umm . I made it all up.
eng_Latn always patient and in fact is the merchant's confidante.
eng_Latn gave me out of the window her hand to kiss.
eng_Latn I must speak to you
eng_Latn fully expressed his feelings, and has since become famous.
eng_Latn he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul.
eng_Latn but, in his contemplation, it is doubtful whether he had heard this.
eng_Latn I'm just going to teach you the rules this evening
eng_Latn I could not bear to wait in the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.
eng_Latn he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
eng_Latn what a sweet, charming little wedding this will make!
eng_Latn the three of them stood watching him expectantly until he bent and scooped the twins up, one on either hip.
eng_Latn I may be able to ship off my black vassals
eng_Latn listening to their footsteps dying away.
eng_Latn I'd bet he's keeping it close to home.
eng_Latn SHOOTING STARS!
eng_Latn in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt.
eng_Latn I've run quite out of it.
eng_Latn to join this assembly
eng_Latn on purpose, so as to destroy your faith in me completely.
eng_Latn I rang to tell you that.
eng_Latn while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of the man
eng_Latn tapped at his door, and softly called to him.
eng_Latn the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.
eng_Latn it cannot be more
eng_Latn a black jacket, and a pair of hard, stiff corduroy trousers
eng_Latn his voice even sadder than I remembered.
eng_Latn bound her to the old days, to old friends.
eng_Latn entered the room from the door at which she had been listening.
eng_Latn I am resolved to make this the most desperate affair I was ever engaged on in my whole life.
eng_Latn He was quite sweet really.
eng_Latn but which was powerful and troubling.
eng_Latn taught those who were interested how to dance his national dances
eng_Latn I deleted it.
eng_Latn for his virtue is at present exhausted
eng_Latn I waited for him to go on.
eng_Latn he gave me a lift home.
eng_Latn read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.
eng_Latn but more difficult to conduct to an end
eng_Latn she was filled once she reached fifteen and sixteen
eng_Latn when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had loved.
eng_Latn but I'm so hungry I could happily eat cardboard.
eng_Latn there's the window and the rod
eng_Latn I had taken great pains to repress them
eng_Latn remembering that he had charged without orders,felt sure his commander was sending
eng_Latn but the hand made no response'dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.
eng_Latn I never see anything so lovely.
eng_Latn I don't even know what itching powder is!
eng_Latn I won't disturb their happiness.
eng_Latn but unfortunately I was an eye witness, and was also on the commission of inquiry.
eng_Latn which I spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a hundred yards distant from the city.
eng_Latn I came to see a man here.
eng_Latn if the beast has notbeen watered, it must be.
eng_Latn he has amazing strong feelings.
eng_Latn I stare back at him, feeling a breathless mixture of anger and exhilaration.
eng_Latn Assistancing is what we do.
eng_Latn concerning whom he had a strong brotherly opinion.
eng_Latn That small things can do big things on which they can depend. That a Tiny Digger got the job done in.
eng_Latn so they threw a can of cold water over him
eng_Latn the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
eng_Latn tell me the name of the house where we are.
eng_Latn by the time he had got into bed, he had made up his mind
eng_Latn I advanced forward
eng_Latn they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see.
eng_Latn if at first he feigned a wish to absent himself in order to cure his love
eng_Latn which invariably stuck to the jamb, and then, when you wrenched it open, shook the whole cottage.
eng_Latn I must remember how you said that.
eng_Latn ...belongs with this shoe!
eng_Latn who waved back, grinning.
eng_Latn It's those naughty bookshop mice!
eng_Latn a half years than the sugar has.
eng_Latn I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.
eng_Latn that he had emptied the whole vocabulary into his frame
eng_Latn generous without limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in short, first in all that constitutes goodness
eng_Latn I sense the creature changing.
eng_Latn but not that he was notguilty.
eng_Latn but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles
eng_Latn who did not answer but raised his head and again looked into the mother's face.
eng_Latn but perhaps he didn't want another row
eng_Latn she had no friends of her own age to contribute to her education.
eng_Latn I should choose this if I might,
eng_Latn Remarkable Pug, but not asremarkableas the bee who flaps it's wings one hundred and thirty three times every second!
eng_Latn neither touch, nor smell, nor anything else about the good lass that would have made any
eng_Latn puts faith in you
eng_Latn he had not thought lately, but which still found place in his soul.
eng_Latn dressed in black and concealed in a long veil
eng_Latn for those were your accents as certain as I live they were yours!
eng_Latn had caused irreparable damage to the furniture
eng_Latn two thousand dollars or more with whichthis appeal could be conducted.
eng_Latn the sale won't be valid, and it 'll all go back to the estate.
eng_Latn she thought her father did it purposely when she was there
eng_Latn if you still adhere to your present resolution
eng_Latn her father had changed so much that
eng_Latn even to the cost of the plugs that would have to be put to the damaged wine skins.
eng_Latn I remember a couple of overturned chairs
eng_Latn a few steps farther
eng_Latn she had no ear
eng_Latn but a chamber in which onereposes costs twenty francs.
eng_Latn although she was blue with fright herself,
eng_Latn though it is an imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps
eng_Latn THOK! and it rose higher than his head and came down and rolled away.
eng_Latn losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more.
eng_Latn I'll share myself with both.
eng_Latn even when they anticipate no answer.
eng_Latn but as though he hadn't time to waste on such trifles.
eng_Latn that my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely repugnant to my own nature
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn she recognized him immediately.
eng_Latn It's a question we can explore as long as we keep asking it, and never reach
eng_Latn for three days following, eat nothing but bread and water.
eng_Latn I took the axe and smashed in the door.
eng_Latn now flying into a passion again at this unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.
eng_Latn she never knew when to keep her mouth shut.
eng_Latn he stood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.
eng_Latn how weak he is in his misery!
eng_Latn he woke up in a fright, calling for a blanket.
eng_Latn but they were both pure metal.
eng_Latn dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter.
eng_Latn I didn't say any more
eng_Latn that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer,
eng_Latn but contrary to all human reality.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Dog?
eng_Latn Alive...and I didn t notice?
eng_Latn but he'll be keeping his distance even more from now on.
eng_Latn I think she recognized me, for she pressed my hand.
eng_Latn but he restrained himself.
eng_Latn knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where he is stationed
eng_Latn striking it into the lower part of the half suspended mass, placed its other end crutch wise under one arm
eng_Latn he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room were his murderers
eng_Latn its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.
eng_Latn I thought'well, I thought maybe we could all go in town
eng_Latn I cannot rest until I have retrieved my losses.
eng_Latn in favour of one of them remaining.
eng_Latn had nothing to do with the invisible power that taught him how to breathe from within and control his heartbeats
eng_Latn hardly was his head laid back on the pillow than he went to sleep.
eng_Latn by separating the several parts
eng_Latn took it up, and examined it very attentively.
eng_Latn with still endless room left over to suffer in.
eng_Latn but because I hate keeping things long
eng_Latn rsula watched him with innocent attention
eng_Latn Prepare to engage warp drive!
eng_Latn the minimum of risk, trying to copy the people about her and to take their moral measure.
eng_Latn said I was a brave fellow, and went away.
eng_Latn go and call to her yourself from the study.
eng_Latn that was the state of the case!
eng_Latn his own voice, in his ears, was as dull and wearisome as everything else.
eng_Latn headed down to the entrance hall.
eng_Latn they practised cautiously,after supper
eng_Latn it has not been possible to lay hands on it.
eng_Latn but now he felt disinclined to go to it.
eng_Latn he had to be face to face with a snake to do it.
eng_Latn I am so sorry to have kept you waiting
eng_Latn Which is why you tried to scare us away.
eng_Latn I can see some astounding feet Dog!
eng_Latn I ought to know who I am
eng_Latn but the others felt that this wasirreligious.
eng_Latn in fact, she could not bear the earth in her mouth.
eng_Latn men in the UK averaged 82% accuracy in reverse parking someone else's car close to the kerb
eng_Latn you may simply have taken it out of your cash box and brought it to the court.
eng_Latn it was arranged to include them both in one program.
eng_Latn I don't care a damn about all that.
eng_Latn ordered footmen to bring the others
eng_Latn not for money, not for wages! he shouted.
eng_Latn I have to find a man who knows that universal language.
eng_Latn to enjoy excellent health herself.
eng_Latn not to eat anything he had tasted
eng_Latn the men were courteous and tender
eng_Latn which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point of falling.
eng_Latn pushed open the front door.
eng_Latn but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem.
eng_Latn there's a difference between eight thousand and eleven thousand.
eng_Latn I'll pull off his cassock,
eng_Latn humming a tune, reach for her comb and run it through her hair.
eng_Latn but this impossibility only strengthens my argument.
eng_Latn but he had never succeeded in making his friends accept his wife.
eng_Latn Then that s what I will do!
eng_Latn cast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end of my chain.
eng_Latn I have still the same old illusions.
eng_Latn were you not ashamed to disturb the dead?
eng_Latn I've been blabbering non stop for an hour to this complete stranger.
eng_Latn I warned you before. Onemore mistake and you d be banned from my grand spelling contest !
eng_Latn in a rapture that she had neither laughed
eng_Latn but it was so no longer.
eng_Latn but before he could do anything else
eng_Latn she was hoping she might run inter someone else at my house.
eng_Latn he would be well respected, comfortably provided for.
eng_Latn it was as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
eng_Latn she had fallen dead of fear and of fatigue.
eng_Latn though by no means so unfavorably impressed as she had feared she might be.
eng_Latn he couldn't get it out again.
eng_Latn I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him
eng_Latn but it required quite an effort for him to find his voice.
eng_Latn for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised
eng_Latn who answered him.
eng_Latn but she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and his grandfather came to his rescue.
eng_Latn had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.
eng_Latn Then perhaps if you do everythingyou did today BACKWARDS you may find it again.
eng_Latn something terribleabout one of our own members.
eng_Latn only it was alive between his teeth and therefore better.
eng_Latn you owe it to yourself to develop the kind of personality that radiates warmth and confidence, and which attracts people to you wherever you go.
eng_Latn had sudden accesses of unreasonable self confidence when he perceived himself elevated on a pinnacle of power and safety beyond the reach of mere mortal plotters.
eng_Latn in his bogus military uniform with his fake decorations
eng_Latn I was short and abominably dressed
eng_Latn which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before.
eng_Latn I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard
eng_Latn A cherry cupcake? Why yes it is. Oh, and this is my new friend. Dog, Thessie - Meet Minotaur.
eng_Latn but it must be confessed that before he reached home he had taken his resolution.
eng_Latn too proud to admit she wasnt able to walk properly.
eng_Latn for she was always at the head of her class so that
eng_Latn encountered the face of his interesting consort
eng_Latn I felt a sort of shiver down my back.
eng_Latn knock off a buck an' a half.
eng_Latn JeanValjean perceived it by the way she dragged more
eng_Latn if you choose, you may say good bye
eng_Latn before the afternoon was done
eng_Latn as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for my child.
eng_Latn he'll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.
eng_Latn if he should not have returned by that time
eng_Latn get it out of your head entirely that this can be settled in any way but marriage.
eng_Latn as I held them up
eng_Latn because they are too feeble and diseased to stand the open air.
eng_Latn but will lose all you have,
eng_Latn Bravo!
eng_Latn happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.
eng_Latn crying her eyes out
eng_Latn which restored her tranquillity and her will to live.
eng_Latn so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster
eng_Latn knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over.
eng_Latn our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.
eng_Latn she could even make a passably good periwig
eng_Latn I must have, I suppose.
eng_Latn all anger and gloom removed, not to fix upon any being the proper thing for true knights errant
eng_Latn I expect you to feel flattered.
eng_Latn there must be something about the house, or the way it was built
eng_Latn I'll be as prim ad I can and not get into any scrapes, if I can help it.
eng_Latn in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right.
eng_Latn she was reminded of night calls to death and calamity
eng_Latn swing all day upon his lower jaw.
eng_Latn that he was in the society of some nabob
eng_Latn I think I saw his name in here a minute ago.
eng_Latn she dared to recall for the first time the illusory days of that unreal love.
eng_Latn Like that one Granny Pug?
eng_Latn for the moment I lose sight,'
eng_Latn she is so very unreasonable.
eng_Latn yet so well set out was it that it seemed that every part had room to spread itself fittingly
eng_Latn because they have managed two or three intrigues
eng_Latn a small straight nose and luminous, nutbrown skin.
eng_Latn some fifty, some nearer seventy, feet high.
eng_Latn Ah. Listen, Pug. That music. Sotypically French.
eng_Latn that the tunnel is of magical origin and can only be closed magically.
eng_Latn there is an _I_ in the upper infinity asthere is an _I_ in the lower infinity.
eng_Latn yet could hardly leave her easel
eng_Latn I wouldn't have one in my house.
eng_Latn in which I struggled nakedly to my feet, and rocked moaning in wonder that it was not a dream
eng_Latn was to be seen in its place
eng_Latn de fog dat's been aroun' all night.
eng_Latn I don't mean to obey it
eng_Latn thinking of him directly.
eng_Latn did not like to be left alone with the nosy man
eng_Latn shook it directly over my head
eng_Latn that is to you.
eng_Latn hoping you find yourself well, sir!
eng_Latn for which I was unqualified by the meanness of my condition.
eng_Latn with that he gave me a twitch
eng_Latn drinkin' and raisin' hell and screwin' around.
eng_Latn that in this world there is neither honor nor justice.
eng_Latn I assure you I was,' she returned.
eng_Latn so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead.
eng_Latn I would not give a farthing to be told what's past with me
eng_Latn I never see him get around so since
eng_Latn a rack and manger, extending the whole length on one side.
eng_Latn there was a great maggoty haggis
eng_Latn they should all be obliterated for her sake.
eng_Latn I explained it.
eng_Latn without surprise, without any active sentiment whatever.
eng_Latn I intend that you shall have it.
eng_Latn his adversary seized him by the hair
eng_Latn sitting under the almond trees in the little park
eng_Latn she the fairest mortal ever set eyes on.
eng_Latn let the daughter have free advent
eng_Latn that the young girl's heart was filled with gratitude.
eng_Latn showed a deepened depression in the outer angle of his bushy eyebrows
eng_Latn came back to the inn, returned to the theatre
eng_Latn took up her residence with her brother, crowding the occupants of the little house.
eng_Latn ...I love books that take me on a journey far, far away.
eng_Latn would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else's borzois.
eng_Latn my truck had lived a long, full life and then expired of natural causes.
eng_Latn of composure and imperturbable self possession.
eng_Latn he'd do if he was awake.
eng_Latn for if she was offered to him between two plates the horse would not hanker after her.
eng_Latn Oh yes. It's monsters I'm afraid of.
eng_Latn turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance
eng_Latn carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all.
eng_Latn he don't feel like he's earnin' his keep.
eng_Latn she objected, guessing my motives.
eng_Latn not sure what to do.
eng_Latn I will be a god to whom he can pray
eng_Latn interrupted the good woman, with a sad air
eng_Latn Bow-wowser! What a feast!
eng_Latn And so Don Quixote set off towardshis greatest challenge, on a hill not far away.
eng_Latn help us now and so atone.
eng_Latn they can hardly expose us.
eng_Latn while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten
eng_Latn that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last
eng_Latn in which my father buried me.
eng_Latn I am sooooooo hungry.
eng_Latn welcomed the enemy infantry with a hail of bullets.
eng_Latn sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.
eng_Latn I wanted it dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might.
eng_Latn I ve seen bigger burgers.
eng_Latn but somehow all he succeeded in doing was having her back in his arms
eng_Latn I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.
eng_Latn but the sizzling steam made me fear a general explosion which would sweep across my men swarming like ants over the booty with a blast of jagged fragments.
eng_Latn just one big heavy blast from the past, a great big golden gasser.
eng_Latn with four heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.
eng_Latn I can't bear to hear about it.
eng_Latn YIP! Ah I was having a very strange dream Dog.
eng_Latn not that they would ever speak.
eng_Latn all men assuredly must have coveted her.
eng_Latn until he is ready to tell us the whole story.
eng_Latn I know a good deal about land and cattle already.
eng_Latn telling how as well as why she came to behere, also why she had not come before.
eng_Latn died away in the prevailing silence.
eng_Latn he thought, and stopped short.
eng_Latn herself taking another, she called me to her side.
eng_Latn where the empty pigeon house and dog kennel are
eng_Latn then carried the milk into the porch
eng_Latn reflected that the very apparent insignificance of his aim would help him to success.
eng_Latn sat so long after it
eng_Latn caused her to look round.
eng_Latn I was there all the while she had no time to do it!
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn up the corridor, and back upstairs.
eng_Latn twenty five years too late.
eng_Latn but find me another precisely placed as you are.
eng_Latn the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the best supper that was in his power.
eng_Latn Pug, I know you are behind there.
eng_Latn arriving at the point, he fastenedthe rope which
eng_Latn he says he's lost one eye for good
eng_Latn as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship
eng_Latn walked to the front door.
eng_Latn I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it.
eng_Latn I confess to you that I had doubts, at first
eng_Latn I went on one side about two hundred yards
eng_Latn when she did not he picked up the reins.
eng_Latn as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at
eng_Latn as if he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all visitors.
eng_Latn than in keeping dogs and horses only to gallop over it.
eng_Latn Keeping going is what dogs do!
eng_Latn though of course poverty is no crime we must remember that!
eng_Latn I went down the cellar to find evidence of a werewolf.
eng_Latn I have my own grief, always the same, always the same.
eng_Latn he clasped him in his arms so closely
eng_Latn reached his pen and examined it
eng_Latn but I heard no other returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little shriller than his.
eng_Latn so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.
eng_Latn I'll tell you how we'll do.
eng_Latn could anyone be more entirely lost than I?
eng_Latn Hmmm. How curious. The only penguin in Antarctica who feels the cold.
eng_Latn I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.
eng_Latn he observedthat he was coming to some arched windows, where he perceived a light.
eng_Latn always went to bed at nightfall, so that she might notburn out her candles.
eng_Latn as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead
eng_Latn I'm not angry anymore.
eng_Latn when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs
eng_Latn lose it all or bring me back six thousand francs.
eng_Latn I have been up to the eyes in this business.
eng_Latn evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing
eng_Latn suddenly the elevator seemed no more than telephone booth size, then coffin size.
eng_Latn Not a sniff or a snicker of a missing picnicker. Pug? Have you vanished too?
eng_Latn the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers and two children
eng_Latn watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker's shop,' said the first.
eng_Latn on which he was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.
eng_Latn but she had agreed it was the only practical solution.
eng_Latn I was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest timber trees, for oars and masts
eng_Latn on his last visit this had struck him
eng_Latn was all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice
eng_Latn I know, I know.
eng_Latn on the other neither good nor evil on earth
eng_Latn he asked me to go and see him.
eng_Latn looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long
eng_Latn scrambled into bed with him
eng_Latn but cautiously kept silence and looked at his mother
eng_Latn he was ready to get down upon his knees to the woman
eng_Latn I shall depend upon a most particular description of it.
eng_Latn I pull the crumpled ad out of my jeans pocket, where it's been since yesterday.
eng_Latn for it is plain enough that they who are within are either asleep
eng_Latn without first wandering in this manner
eng_Latn the lady should accept the situation without protest is very amazing.
eng_Latn how he had looked when he slipped it on her finger.
eng_Latn it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts.
eng_Latn I thought I'd grieved you.
eng_Latn To the rescue!
eng_Latn but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear.
eng_Latn that he did not dare to challenge her.
eng_Latn he clasped him in his arms so closely
eng_Latn he could see how privileged and relaxed and apparently decidedly happy were those of that circle.
eng_Latn perhaps because the pity that he inspired was mixed with love
eng_Latn I was distracted by a sudden fluttering pressure against the outside of my shield.
eng_Latn if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive tomorrow with the child
eng_Latn that he would come and take her away.
eng_Latn I saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me
eng_Latn then looked away
eng_Latn only smoke and blackened ruins remained.
eng_Latn where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
eng_Latn she slipped her hand into her breast
eng_Latn she had stepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her husband.
eng_Latn so take it away
eng_Latn as he afterwards told me
eng_Latn she persisted in riding on the sled.
eng_Latn all clad in ivy and hemp stained green
eng_Latn it has made you look pale.
eng_Latn branded him in adventurer who did not represent the party.
eng_Latn a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him.
eng_Latn she filled on the port tack and was off again
eng_Latn Don t go shopping in number twenty three.
eng_Latn I should so hate for people to think me a thief.
eng_Latn he vomited up his inside over his very master
eng_Latn did not insert or name in it a certain lady of whom it was questionable whether she was one or not.
eng_Latn you just trying to protect the guys on your unit
eng_Latn I must speak to you
eng_Latn I was underhand.
eng_Latn a square little box, unpainted and bare, and the barn, low roofed and huddled.
eng_Latn free to walk around the farm and breathe the fresh country air
eng_Latn she had too much tact, and knew her limitations.
eng_Latn put on a livery, get up behind the carriage
eng_Latn except through cowardice,
eng_Latn I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee.
eng_Latn I wish I were, if only for the sake of justifying myself in her eyes.
eng_Latn the three of them bent over the damp spotted pages.
eng_Latn which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services.
eng_Latn that in most people's estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
eng_Latn I dream of him, how he's lookin for us even now
eng_Latn a girl who would have been requiring you to see the stars by daylight.
eng_Latn Look! A boat!
eng_Latn Erm How do you do? I am Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn I shall be very much surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night.
eng_Latn growing decidedly nervous so much so that his hand trembled slightly.
eng_Latn he now realized what the difficulty was.
eng_Latn oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to him.
eng_Latn I'm tempted to leave it behind and not even bother looking at it
eng_Latn must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye beer, onions,
eng_Latn who had contrived a new method for building houses
eng_Latn except the bed, a few chairs, and the kitchen table.
eng_Latn there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!
eng_Latn attempted a complicated sort of wiggling action
eng_Latn because of the possibility that the boy might wound himself.
eng_Latn Just because she s Mrs Honey Bunny, doesn t mean she s a pushover!
eng_Latn I doubt if he'll ever learn.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Dog?
eng_Latn a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again
eng_Latn then cooked some bacon in the frying pan for supper
eng_Latn he had thrown it into the river
eng_Latn I let the words spill out, my voice low.
eng_Latn strode quickly from the room.
eng_Latn she had no ear
eng_Latn the truculent dirty old man with his wooden peg sticking stiffly out over the dashboard
eng_Latn took heart to the extent, at least, of thinking that at once now, by some hook or crook, he must find a doctor to whom he could send her.
eng_Latn whether or not the sun is to be divided and portioned out
eng_Latn for that sort of battle will serve to knock the dust out of us instead of hurting us.
eng_Latn so he picked up his nimble heels and flew.
eng_Latn I swear, on my salvation, he's going to his grave
eng_Latn so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as I cannot give you more
eng_Latn where, having quickly squandered it
eng_Latn if the beast has notbeen watered, it must be.
eng_Latn having directed him to the servants' hall
eng_Latn defending himself against superior forces of the enemy
eng_Latn beg her tolet me go.
eng_Latn but the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his father's chilly smile.
eng_Latn because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return
eng_Latn the maitre d'hotel and a waiter and a girl behind a desk.
eng_Latn for the first few days he stayed in his room
eng_Latn I'd better knock first, and he knocked.
eng_Latn eyes still closed.
eng_Latn that you ought to get married, that's what I say.
eng_Latn I knew they would hear me coming, bike or no bike, so surprise was out.
eng_Latn after dinner I'll come back
eng_Latn all hands were turned to
eng_Latn I wanted to take him in my arms and kiss him
eng_Latn he will never trouble anyone in this country again.
eng_Latn while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement.
eng_Latn I dare say it is no great matter for you to be locked up.
eng_Latn for she had received proposals from nearly all the young men in the neighborhood
eng_Latn had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person.
eng_Latn he was only a baby!
eng_Latn the girl won't know where she is
eng_Latn so that it would not be too obvious that it was really a document of love.
eng_Latn I handed her a book on cookies and bars.
eng_Latn was to come one of these days and take her.
eng_Latn I intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you.
eng_Latn people quite new to him, belonging to a different world
eng_Latn when my master proposed an expedient to the assembly
eng_Latn it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.
eng_Latn voice of distress quickly thinned away
eng_Latn found himself again in the same attitude on the same paving stone of the parapet.
eng_Latn she shuddered with loathing.
eng_Latn jumping, ducking, and breaking through
eng_Latn I wilst defeat them.
eng_Latn I start typing drivel into my computer
eng_Latn I believe we are getting rather dizzy, Pug. But we must keep going...
eng_Latn What do you think, Pug?
eng_Latn just listen for a moment.
eng_Latn And this belongs with this... AND this belongs with this.
eng_Latn I was asked to see her off.
eng_Latn I've brought you a letter.
eng_Latn to morrow, he will take the wall of a prime minister.
eng_Latn I asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl.
eng_Latn it will bring bad luck.
eng_Latn made a careful note of what he had spent, so that his partner would not be cheated.
eng_Latn remained silent for some time.
eng_Latn it's time he began to work for his bread.
eng_Latn pointing her to a different direction.
eng_Latn Umm How curious.
eng_Latn a slave does not dictate to a master
eng_Latn then, when they had passed
eng_Latn was tending even then to transformation.
eng_Latn without a sound escaping under the touch of her light foot.
eng_Latn an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them.
eng_Latn How marvellous Pug. Speedingthrough space in our own star ship.
eng_Latn to pity us
eng_Latn but this time it was a silence so stiff with excitement you could almost taste it.
eng_Latn suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him.
eng_Latn she hindered me from going further by securing it against me.
eng_Latn but you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare.
eng_Latn her blood turning to ice water.
eng_Latn I smell an adventure Pug. This way.
eng_Latn raising his camera.
eng_Latn There s hardly any oil left in thelamp! It's the oil that keeps the lamp alight.
eng_Latn she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both
eng_Latn I was startled.
eng_Latn to be left alone in the cold world so.
eng_Latn every inch of it their own property appeared to the animals so desirable a place.
eng_Latn I went off the boil in 1916,' I told him.
eng_Latn I had put my chair away, and was going out of the room
eng_Latn or, at least, a part of the truth.
eng_Latn since the island arose out of the seas.
eng_Latn a jug of iced pumpkin juice
eng_Latn turning away so that his brother in law could not see him, he sat down on a chair at the window.
eng_Latn then turned forward, twitched his own bridle
eng_Latn I never heard her speak
eng_Latn he never felt his own lack.
eng_Latn there also he had made preparations so that he might have a refuge.
eng_Latn he showed a bag a hundred flints.
eng_Latn but his mind was turned away again
eng_Latn as though his sleeping brain had been working on it all night.
eng_Latn that his father would carry candor, or rather rudeness
eng_Latn though, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one.
eng_Latn but it was impossible to shut out the vision of what was happening all around her.
eng_Latn for her mind was busy planning.
eng_Latn standing less than a hundredfeet from the house
eng_Latn but it doesn't compare with break bone fever.
eng_Latn to expect me to love by choice is idle.
eng_Latn when the next comes and wants to marry you
eng_Latn I heartily wish our _Yahoos_ would be so tractable.
eng_Latn but the blood had stopped forever.
eng_Latn I've got something to tell you, my dear
eng_Latn I'm of no mind to have my money used for the benefit of such a person.
eng_Latn that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open
eng_Latn she had unconsciously laid her hand again on the little hand that she had pressed before.
eng_Latn now here you are and here I am, and it all happened just like that.
eng_Latn I traded a dozen different comparisons in my mind, but none of them fit exactly.
eng_Latn but my daughter is so young
eng_Latn A very good question Dog. Let's find out.
eng_Latn the other was tall and strapping, with a thin back mustache.
eng_Latn some other room in some other rooming house maybe
eng_Latn I will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community.
eng_Latn Isn t it marvellous!
eng_Latn now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
eng_Latn when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too.
eng_Latn tracking animals and finding water.
eng_Latn but for one who has a timid conscience
eng_Latn in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman
eng_Latn let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage.
eng_Latn her whole aspect sparkling with health and spirits.
eng_Latn so changed she was
eng_Latn I hope your wish to see me is not due to the return of unpleasant symptoms
eng_Latn And join the dots with this pencil!
eng_Latn that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.
eng_Latn then, leaning against the writing table, he stayed until the evening, buried in a sorrowful reverie.
eng_Latn inquire if she could do anything for him.
eng_Latn I have seen... a machine.
eng_Latn braid of hair laid carefully above her forehead, into the middle of the room.
eng_Latn Run Dog. Run!
eng_Latn where she knew the male would follow her.
eng_Latn until the nurse had one head instead of three heads floating side by side.
eng_Latn bore down upon us as before, until the breath was nearly edged out of my body.
eng_Latn but at least his eyes had lost that awful dead fish look.
eng_Latn girding herself for combat.
eng_Latn I hear a whoosh as he propels himself towards me.
eng_Latn I don t understand.
eng_Latn ask her if I may come.
eng_Latn I'll answer for that boy's truth with my life!
eng_Latn Then I'm afraid you ll have to wait Pug.
eng_Latn I never returned to the country where she lived
eng_Latn the priest drew in an immense quantity of snuff out of the hollow of his palm.
eng_Latn I found half a dozen grey hairs this morning
eng_Latn I love you.
eng_Latn they looked at him, they looked at each other
eng_Latn for if you are killed I shall be alone in the world
eng_Latn how I never knew their hard, hard history.
eng_Latn I quitted the chamber.
eng_Latn the men came out again, one after another, on the road
eng_Latn I streaked for the bathroom with my hand clamped over my mouth.
eng_Latn when you get down to rock bottom?
eng_Latn cried and then laughed unnaturally.
eng_Latn with a strong slash across the neck, I thoroughly despatched it.
eng_Latn you promised to take me fishing?
eng_Latn Is it Major Amazing?
eng_Latn I'm not sure your plan worked either Dog.
eng_Latn I'm afraid you must be prepared for a great shock!
eng_Latn I left the circle, moving toward the west so that I could turn my back on him.
eng_Latn extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely.
eng_Latn if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.
eng_Latn it had always been with her there on the chair where she was sitting
eng_Latn not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant
eng_Latn leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot
eng_Latn I took that hump for your forehead.
eng_Latn then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort
eng_Latn And a flag especially for dogs.
eng_Latn until she had made a good match.
eng_Latn Oh dear. I should be in the GreatHall with the others - but I just can t stand the racket!
eng_Latn I could not forbear breaking out into expressions, perhaps a little too extravagant.
eng_Latn they had another contrivance for taking my measure.
eng_Latn then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count
eng_Latn one bank of which was the bed, the other the table.
eng_Latn but no sound of a door being opened or shut.
eng_Latn in order to see the operation well performed
eng_Latn forgive me if I've asked you a lot of rude questions, my dear
eng_Latn then she shrank back and half sprang to her feet in amazement.
eng_Latn she was taking great care not to say anything to embarrass her companion.
eng_Latn each crying up the other's perfection in braying.
eng_Latn night found them back on the river with a quarter of a mile to the day's credit.
eng_Latn glanced at his watch.
eng_Latn seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.
eng_Latn surprise for you all
eng_Latn was so vast that there seemed trapped in it the wind itself.
eng_Latn then the third went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.
eng_Latn see if shecould not secure a church, or two, or three, in which to speak andplead his cause.
eng_Latn or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is
eng_Latn without delay and without coffins
eng_Latn dared not say even anything pretty about the gift of the ornaments
eng_Latn as a means of ridding her of a guardianship which
eng_Latn his remaining a bachelor will usually depend on her resolution rather than on his.
eng_Latn Pug, I think it might be best if you abandoned woodwork and joined me in the shop.
eng_Latn but times are changed and the little money that remains to me is not my own
eng_Latn who is now in his mid forties
eng_Latn smelling ditches that were not even deep enough to drown a man.
eng_Latn I raised my hand experimentally, and the woman in the mirror copied the movement, touching her face, too.
eng_Latn she swept off toward the girls' staircase without another word.
eng_Latn so, going up to him,
eng_Latn just the quiet and the coffee in my hands'but it wasn't.
eng_Latn I didn't even have to use magic on him he fell in love with me of his own accord.
eng_Latn I never heard you make such a comparison before.
eng_Latn cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main job of the morning.
eng_Latn fly, baby, up into the sky until the wind goes somewhere else, leaving him to scream all the way down in a helpless power dive.
eng_Latn all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday.
eng_Latn where the servant had gone out
eng_Latn Like the bookshop mice are doing now Dog.
eng_Latn the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill usage and violence
eng_Latn again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and her.
eng_Latn but all your frightful stories have so upset me
eng_Latn for he needed grist for the grinding activity of his mind.
eng_Latn I was asked to see her off.
eng_Latn he was at liberty to wander about the house.
eng_Latn I can't feel a way through her shield to get a sense of it at all.
eng_Latn took himself off on tiptoe.
eng_Latn so long as they are books of honest entertainment that charm by their style and attract and interest by the invention they display
eng_Latn the three of them stood watching him expectantly until he bent and scooped the twins up, one on either hip.
eng_Latn bent over the body.
eng_Latn still seem to want to know you
eng_Latn then I run back across the room and in behind the door.
eng_Latn as the rind wraps an orange.
eng_Latn And Gemini the twins...and Orion!
eng_Latn Dog, the big spider s friendly andshe likes me!
eng_Latn I haven't thought of other women since I met the merchant's daughter.
eng_Latn A pool.
eng_Latn pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
eng_Latn crushed and crestfallen.
eng_Latn repaired his own at the same time.
eng_Latn for there was still no word about the reopening of the canning factory
eng_Latn came in from the bakehouse with the loin of mutton which was our joint stock repast.
eng_Latn but it required quite an effort for him to find his voice.
eng_Latn after considering for a few moments, said
eng_Latn but the thing to remember was that the very fact
eng_Latn it appeared, at present, her favourite diversion.
eng_Latn over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them.
eng_Latn almost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.
eng_Latn the air was fresh and dewy.
eng_Latn afraid of being in the way when she was with them.
eng_Latn I think your arrival will have a most beneficial influence upon him.
eng_Latn not because he is a bad son
eng_Latn That is because of the fog Pug. It's like a cloud with a really bad cold.
eng_Latn then turned to find the bay mares gentle eyes fixed on him.
eng_Latn I wandered back again into the hall.
eng_Latn cook their porridge.
eng_Latn his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth with all the intensity of thirst engendered by heat and fear.
eng_Latn which would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter.
eng_Latn fenders battered and hammered back.
eng_Latn let us see if we can find them for her.
eng_Latn Does he always ask so many quest ions?
eng_Latn or perhaps worse!
eng_Latn I'm silent for a few seconds, trying to remember exactly what he did say.
eng_Latn I was a young boy
eng_Latn putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand hold on the whip itself
eng_Latn Oh dear. Last again.
eng_Latn it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing
eng_Latn that I, too, was given an appointment at the green bench today!
eng_Latn he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question.
eng_Latn fell into talk with him , stopping beside a neat yellow sheaf of rye laid on the thrashing floor for seed.
eng_Latn still a man, who, if indeed peculiar
eng_Latn then fell swamping back into the deep.
eng_Latn but there was no bag, and neither hat nor cloak.
eng_Latn there was no time for the smoothing out
eng_Latn so I might as well start there and treat it as a warm up.
eng_Latn but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to be rumpled.
eng_Latn all about it.
eng_Latn my own father was a sublieutenant in the army.
eng_Latn I am not particularly interested in anyone's opinion,
eng_Latn even if we are buried down here in the country.
eng_Latn took an enormous teapot from the shelf
eng_Latn had certainly helped so greatly in bringing about the presidential tour
eng_Latn I wrenched myself back from the memory.
eng_Latn I'd made up my mind to do things well.
eng_Latn they showed, with great strength of reason, that the royal throne could not be supported without corruption
eng_Latn I ll count to ten and then try to find you.
eng_Latn he probably thinks I don't care a thing about him except as a friend.
eng_Latn for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before
eng_Latn I am, therefore, in a measure constrained to follow that road
eng_Latn I am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients!
eng_Latn suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedcloth
eng_Latn I am so sorry to have kept you waiting
eng_Latn I have about ten dollars myself.
eng_Latn I merely wanted to set your mind at ease.
eng_Latn as if he were considering that.
eng_Latn I shall show you that I know more than that.
eng_Latn while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant.
eng_Latn But not as amazing as the world record for the most people balancing books on their heads at one time - 998!
eng_Latn those who could wipe out mankind.
eng_Latn evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated.
eng_Latn I told her quite truthfully that I did not think she would do any good coming over.
eng_Latn you seem to be making more haste than suits that mule.
eng_Latn it can't be helped.
eng_Latn she stood on the platform, trying to think what she had come here for
eng_Latn I ll have a deep crust with Pepperoni. Ha.Ha Ha Yum ...Yum.
eng_Latn I'm saying things I've never said to anyone.
eng_Latn before we are through you shall see for your selves.
eng_Latn it was in pursuit of this aim that she had gone to town and run about the world
eng_Latn your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities
eng_Latn their reflections were so close together
eng_Latn stood before me, and looked at me attentively.
eng_Latn here, friend, the people are quite beggarly.
eng_Latn dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter.
eng_Latn but share her husband's efforts that her time should pass as happily and as agreeably as possible.
eng_Latn the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost
eng_Latn it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.
eng_Latn I will only add now
eng_Latn there is an end of our investigation.
eng_Latn will be better than in the hands of a good many people I know,
eng_Latn for the time being at least, that certainly he could do as he was told, and would.
eng_Latn NOW are you satisfied?
eng_Latn keep the weather of the island.
eng_Latn I checked she was correct again.
eng_Latn that they did not enter the ballroom till late.
eng_Latn where he will be staying for the next three days.
eng_Latn had listened at his door, as he passed.
eng_Latn asked the visitor
eng_Latn Hold. What manner of creatures arethese?
eng_Latn estate where he had been born and spent his childhood.
eng_Latn roughened by the wind.
eng_Latn but the priest kissed them with love and respect.
eng_Latn she saw the waves rippling peacefully in the moonlight.
eng_Latn who had hidden so many things in this life that there was almost nothing left for them to say to each other.
eng_Latn he knew its rarity in the world of art more than anywhere else.
eng_Latn after urging him not to strip himself of his property
eng_Latn pinning her against the counter as I reached for the toast
eng_Latn for that vile purpose which already he entertained inregard to her.
eng_Latn I only told you that in the goodness of my heart.
eng_Latn You re far away!
eng_Latn sending him reeling backward onto the grass.
eng_Latn the wall thud closed behind them
eng_Latn it was three stories high, and seven hundred feet wide.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know... RUN!
eng_Latn he had only the tendency to that diffusive form of gambling which has no alcoholic intensity
eng_Latn as he shook his head.
eng_Latn the little gallipot of a boat that we were in
eng_Latn felt a pang
eng_Latn but as soon as the princess heard his tone she subsided at once,
eng_Latn then, for the first time, allowed himself a glance round the room and a look at the pictures.
eng_Latn as became a pirate
eng_Latn I cannot give you a more detailed account of this curious case.
eng_Latn to sneer at his watery potion.
eng_Latn there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others.
eng_Latn to contradict this statement
eng_Latn I was afraid of venturing far into the country.
eng_Latn I'm twenty four and it's time I settled down.
eng_Latn where he took off his hat and flung it into the water.
eng_Latn which took up ten good minutes more.
eng_Latn though the surer way would be to let everyone's anger sleep
eng_Latn I wonder where we are? Whoops
eng_Latn if you're interested.
eng_Latn but that smudged chocolate thumbprint stayed on her mind
eng_Latn that thoughtful eye was dry.
eng_Latn then reaches for the door.
eng_Latn but to wantonness and the natural disposition of women
eng_Latn I could not touch the boy.
eng_Latn new dignities and an acknowledged value of which she had often felt the absence.
eng_Latn before I get my dander up
eng_Latn I only know what other men have done.
eng_Latn in view of the fact that pregnant women do not embarrass me as they should.
eng_Latn though I'm glad he's better in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less affectionate to me.
eng_Latn closed the door behind him.
eng_Latn he had been obliged to give in.
eng_Latn none of these durst return to their native countries
eng_Latn Oh dear.
eng_Latn felt sure that he had not eaten that day, and invited him to lunch.
eng_Latn Wow.. Bow-Wowzer!
eng_Latn for death is in this house
eng_Latn which, being well pitched, to prevent leaking
eng_Latn she took them with a brief, expressionless word of thanks
eng_Latn he said in a tough voice.
eng_Latn on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his heart.
eng_Latn I mustn't do anything to risk his contempt.
eng_Latn he was back in his horrible hairy brown suit and gazing up at the top table.
eng_Latn I HAD led this life about a month
eng_Latn I didn't ask her to do that.
eng_Latn I suppose your mothers and fathers tell you you're wonderful.
eng_Latn there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you
eng_Latn And you were there.. and you were there..and you were there!
eng_Latn where two men having met
eng_Latn letting the car come almost to a standstill.
eng_Latn Flying saucers!
eng_Latn I take it you did not conceal the fact from him.
eng_Latn I always will, I suppose.
eng_Latn She s me something special.
eng_Latn he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed.
eng_Latn wrote on the first his own name and on the others those of his two companions
eng_Latn I thought he was mad.
eng_Latn I don't think she knew who I was.
eng_Latn he of course expected me to tell you of it.
eng_Latn something clutched in his hand.
eng_Latn A fox who loves words... terms...expressions.
eng_Latn A soothing sea shanty will calm our aquatic friend.
eng_Latn I am confident that the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn I was looking at your face just now.
eng_Latn I've never told this to a living soul before.
eng_Latn all was black again.
eng_Latn but I could not see her till she arose
eng_Latn that I was not qualified to make any inquiries.
eng_Latn before I could get far enough into the sea
eng_Latn there aren't enough for people to live in
eng_Latn added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.
eng_Latn but there will be time enough to think of that
eng_Latn so that among us, it would be little esteemed.
eng_Latn a single crash of thunder made the earth tremble
eng_Latn I've never seen anything to equal her.
eng_Latn I will'but he's a queer man.
eng_Latn were retreating into the depths of the country.
eng_Latn I'm told to getyou, whatever happens, that's all.
eng_Latn We re inside a dog? I didn t expect that. We must be very small OR the dog is very big!
eng_Latn I haven t chosen a card yet Pug.
eng_Latn though the sky to the west and north stayed clear as ever.
eng_Latn beg her, almost formally, to deliver the message to her father.
eng_Latn he stared bleakly at this plump and fussy woman with the broadbare arms, and wondered how she had ever come here.
eng_Latn Ya soon as Cow has taken her turn to jump you can start your race.
eng_Latn (giggling) In the rude noise? Ha ha!
eng_Latn if they are disposed to do so
eng_Latn Are you sure the Diary doesn t say that we ate a couple of the sandwiches?
eng_Latn but couldn't say much more
eng_Latn trying to amuse, describing my fellow passengers.
eng_Latn raised her hands with a look of sympathy
eng_Latn the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed
eng_Latn believing he was laying on the giant
eng_Latn perfectly embodying his dream of happiness.
eng_Latn that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past
eng_Latn you will be hard pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!
eng_Latn begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.
eng_Latn yet, she had spoken them with great seriousness.
eng_Latn she tore the red sealing wax with her teeth
eng_Latn the tartan scarf didn't help.
eng_Latn balancing it on his knee, let it fall open.
eng_Latn I now began to be weary
eng_Latn even in her despair, she was glad.
eng_Latn fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it
eng_Latn looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there
eng_Latn I warn't easy myself, but I didn't take my hat off, all the same.
eng_Latn I am not afraid of what any body can do.
eng_Latn It looks like we ve both lost our friends in the fog.
eng_Latn the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed
eng_Latn he panted and then he whirled upon the judge.
eng_Latn I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring
eng_Latn besides, 50 per cent of $14,400 was too small a sum to disappear for.
eng_Latn I've watched wolves for twenty odd years.
eng_Latn really you appear to be totally ignorant
eng_Latn Pug? What are you doing?
eng_Latn I had indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers
eng_Latn for you to go on fighting with
eng_Latn she can't have been dreading it
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug.
eng_Latn closed the door behind him.
eng_Latn because of the serge curtain
eng_Latn he would not relent a moment to keep me out of the grave.
eng_Latn I really don't know that it is your business.
eng_Latn he swung round with a deep flush
eng_Latn they flew into the passage crying for help.
eng_Latn she had counted the days and always had been able to congratulate herself that all was well.
eng_Latn I didn't take it!
eng_Latn he leaned forward eagerly
eng_Latn I'll cure myself of this.
eng_Latn all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.
eng_Latn whether she had kept it there ever since
eng_Latn was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.
eng_Latn for instance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches in height
eng_Latn THE IDEA OF FATHERHOOD unleashed a swirl of emotions in me.
eng_Latn but immediately jumped aside in terror.
eng_Latn no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle.
eng_Latn ‘Once upon a time there was a Scary Castle. And it was called the Scary Castle because...
eng_Latn he had a slip of the tongue and said 'in trade
eng_Latn I'm sorry you see us in that way.
eng_Latn her name was indeed the crux of the matter.
eng_Latn captivity has subdued me
eng_Latn there lay before us, the last things in the chest
eng_Latn especially when the lover is in the possession of the object of his love, and
eng_Latn but he felt certain he was not drunk
eng_Latn Wow-bowzer. Now I see. You were just protecting your pyramid and your mummies! And there was I drawing a map so more people could come and disturb you.
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and stand up.
eng_Latn Queen Victoria! Your Majesty.
eng_Latn Dog, how do you find a thing that you ve hidden, but now don t know where it is?
eng_Latn more of the listeners plainly hesitated.
eng_Latn but he seized the axe and added it to the flying circle.
eng_Latn Bet you can t see me, Dog.
eng_Latn Fussy eaters, aren t they?
eng_Latn his serfs, or himself, only one ought to
eng_Latn to whom I shall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay
eng_Latn in whose journal this paragraph appears
eng_Latn then let her head again drop upon her knees
eng_Latn And dun of dem dust went ub bydose!
eng_Latn was that the one she needed most kept aloof
eng_Latn turned in upon itself, and totally disappeared.
eng_Latn my second was towards joy.
eng_Latn though we know he hears us.
eng_Latn it already owned the leather and the grain business of the country.
eng_Latn r, was in despair at his utter inability
eng_Latn the first feeling of guilt at her intended conduct creeping over her.
eng_Latn I will, he said passionately.
eng_Latn received the traveller at the door, hat in hand.
eng_Latn also because she had remarkable strength of character.
eng_Latn having done so, she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned.
eng_Latn of whom he expected such great favours.
eng_Latn as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over.
eng_Latn I could answer that last one.
eng_Latn pushed open the front door.
eng_Latn we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten minutes after we struck our tops'ls and scudded under bare poles
eng_Latn I know, I only said it to finish the sentence.
eng_Latn come, sick and sore! AMEN!
eng_Latn that she was for a minute in uncertainty whether to remain, whether to put off a little longer the painful moment of explanation.
eng_Latn although it was different from that of this island.
eng_Latn they were so much taken up with the affairs and men of letters.
eng_Latn who had kept silent during the life of the deceased elder
eng_Latn all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kindman.
eng_Latn I feel as if you were my property.
eng_Latn because for the first time she had the overwhelming impression
eng_Latn no one quite knew where from or to whom he belonged
eng_Latn even the external forms, indeed, he fancied, must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything.
eng_Latn but for one single instant show thyself,
eng_Latn I tell you I can't bear it
eng_Latn I wish I had a selfie like that.
eng_Latn Not the end.
eng_Latn throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring bolt there
eng_Latn I'll tell him at once
eng_Latn Oh What s this. Bow-Wowzer! You have lots of thingsin your jacket pouch Max.
eng_Latn for he had fallen into the bad habit of speaking aloud
eng_Latn wishing that her parents would stop quarreling.
eng_Latn till she could find an opportunity of opening her heart to her husband.
eng_Latn to return and render him an account of what took place between him and her.
eng_Latn only fastening one of my legs with a chain, near my bed
eng_Latn mounting his ass himself
eng_Latn that was only till two o'clock.
eng_Latn conversed and thought only of matters closely and manifestly connected with their work.
eng_Latn I shut off the engine and got out.
eng_Latn under the visitation of a breath from onhigh.
eng_Latn I must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant.
eng_Latn at least to make us esteem each other.
eng_Latn stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned
eng_Latn were carried down and dumped in the courtyard at the back.
eng_Latn but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him.
eng_Latn almost with gentleness.
eng_Latn very attentively he took his first lesson.
eng_Latn I restore to you the riches and name of your father.
eng_Latn I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little spaniel.
eng_Latn the way you got past that dragon'well
eng_Latn I observed, she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest
eng_Latn It's those naughty bookshop mice Dog! They re making cheesy biscuits.
eng_Latn was unconsciously acting as his enemy
eng_Latn except three or four, or maybe half a dozen.
eng_Latn embracing him as he had done before
eng_Latn I am not particularly interested in anyone's opinion,
eng_Latn which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel
eng_Latn but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters
eng_Latn such is the delight of recovering lost liberty.
eng_Latn our men did what they felt they had to do.
eng_Latn I requested likewise, that the secret of my having a false covering to my body
eng_Latn though for the last three or four years she had had a sneaking suspicion it was coming.
eng_Latn but I am only an old hobbit, and I miss my meal at noon.
eng_Latn because it seemed to her that he was sick.
eng_Latn he will be executed as a parricide.
eng_Latn hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.
eng_Latn only 16% of females could do it.
eng_Latn Pug Rock. Pug Rock. Pug Rock...
eng_Latn I didn't feel the remorse or the guilt or the rage in that second.
eng_Latn I've lost the passwords!
eng_Latn I make a snap decision.
eng_Latn they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
eng_Latn we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping.
eng_Latn died without accomplishing its object.
eng_Latn but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it.
eng_Latn you could never see it.
eng_Latn because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity.
eng_Latn goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish
eng_Latn pushed his hand away.
eng_Latn the guitar came to a jangling stop behind him.
eng_Latn but had some banknotes left over in her wallet.
eng_Latn but at eleven o'clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean
eng_Latn should, at his departure, give the said minister a tweak by the nose
eng_Latn one here and one there
eng_Latn this is the kitchen
eng_Latn but presently rose and took her place before the tea tray.
eng_Latn his two colleagues were already on their feet.
eng_Latn I couldn't do that.
eng_Latn we ain't likely to see many more like him
eng_Latn I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court
eng_Latn And mucky.
eng_Latn wearing robes of palest mauve today
eng_Latn that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks.
eng_Latn he rang his little bell again
eng_Latn whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye.
eng_Latn only now, for the first time, he wasliving it for himself.
eng_Latn in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart.
eng_Latn from whose discretion and courtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.
eng_Latn looked closely at every detail of the plans
eng_Latn whom I've hated for a long time, there.
eng_Latn I see I wor wrang but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
eng_Latn that delicate poise and transition which determine the growth of happy or unhappy consciousness.
eng_Latn a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains!
eng_Latn she was to attend him instantly
eng_Latn I'm going to camouflage it!
eng_Latn if you're hard up
eng_Latn I pulled off my shoes and stockings
eng_Latn for the native rock formed a sill outside it
eng_Latn he abruptly bent double
eng_Latn he was followed by a second, very odd man.
eng_Latn whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac's bullet in my body?
eng_Latn jerks at her skirt to make the old lady sit down on the brick wall.
eng_Latn I wished I'd just gone to the dealership myself.
eng_Latn you will perceive the divine mystery in things.
eng_Latn it was all to beattributed to an unfortunate accident
eng_Latn don't be too certain of your triumph.
eng_Latn This is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn as this knotty point is still unsettled, and as we must not make a mistake in our decision if we can help it, I think we had better take a little breathing time.
eng_Latn it was absurd to care what an anaemic little waitress said to him
eng_Latn I have already told you answered the abbe that I loathe the idea of shedding blood
eng_Latn which contained a wizard with a walrus mustache.
eng_Latn if you're here when I come tomorra, I'll run ya in.
eng_Latn I say this because, if we could not find my lady's palaces or castles to night
eng_Latn the girls, unabashed, stepped back smiling
eng_Latn There must be a way back to thebeginning.
eng_Latn Within these pages you will find the fastest, the tallest, the best things in the world.
eng_Latn holding us two moons in parallel orbit by the sheer force of her will.
eng_Latn I waded ashore in great spirits
eng_Latn Building and Fixing Things .
eng_Latn I shall never see her again!
eng_Latn making certain that his pupils would not notice any gesture of his
eng_Latn she picked up one of those autumn crocuses which to some people signify that very word
eng_Latn made a careful note of what he had spent, so that his partner would not be cheated.
eng_Latn as the two ships crossed each other's wakes
eng_Latn told him the whole story of his adventures up to his being confined in the cage
eng_Latn they'll insist they just keep losing it.
eng_Latn nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.
eng_Latn he held the plate in his hand for an hour at a time
eng_Latn she was not the most adequate of nurses.
eng_Latn I've ridden hard and it'll cost me my skin if I don't get out of here quick
eng_Latn at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed
eng_Latn this is worse than pulling after whales in a calm
eng_Latn now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck
eng_Latn Race you to him!
eng_Latn that he ought not to do.
eng_Latn grabbing the tape measure
eng_Latn insisted that they go back to the castle.
eng_Latn but he was still unprepared for the overpowering vitality of the man.
eng_Latn I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale line.
eng_Latn but then it had to be done only once.
eng_Latn the husky voice he had carried in his soul ever since the afternoon
eng_Latn I'm sorry you don't like him, was her reply.
eng_Latn This shoe...
eng_Latn she stiffened her spine and gave him a cold stare.
eng_Latn she cried, and crossing the room she rang the bell.
eng_Latn I can do it! I can do it! Yeah Wohoo.
eng_Latn basin and spoon in hand
eng_Latn when he was tried, he said that the child died soon, within four hours.
eng_Latn he had upset his father, and that the old man
eng_Latn as if it contained other worlds.
eng_Latn I looked back at the bed I had left.
eng_Latn it would not be possible for one purchaser to buy these shares without declaring his identity.
eng_Latn yet could hardly leave her easel
eng_Latn any glimmering of these can only come from a scientific culture
eng_Latn I liked that old fellow
eng_Latn inside and outside.
eng_Latn after I had read these words from over the way, that I went across the road and looked in.
eng_Latn I was sure of that.
eng_Latn anyway, you can't tame dragons
eng_Latn he saw her home
eng_Latn where a ferryman was waiting to take him across the moat.
eng_Latn that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink
eng_Latn when the front door opened
eng_Latn told her how he had been coming home from the mowing along the highroad and had met her.
eng_Latn better fling them out of the window into the court and make a pile of them
eng_Latn the chastening process was practically continuous.
eng_Latn I am not exactly thanking you
eng_Latn whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns
eng_Latn I enjoyed it much.
eng_Latn but the chances are that he still knows nothing about it.
eng_Latn Another puzzle!
eng_Latn I'm raising myself.
eng_Latn a man's figure emerged from an old house on the opposite side of the shipping basin and approached the bridge.
eng_Latn which, as usual, after hearing once, she had remembered ever afterwards.
eng_Latn whether she should go away at once or see him once more.
eng_Latn there'd be so much to teach you.
eng_Latn should yet exult to the depths of his heart in this wild panorama
eng_Latn thinking that she must order the servant to attend to it as usual
eng_Latn What s wrong with this thing? It won t work.
eng_Latn I promised I would let my father examine me, and he let it go.
eng_Latn that his only association with them now was with high priced call girls.
eng_Latn allthe officers, except five, were either dead or captured.
eng_Latn opened a side door, and went in.
eng_Latn I endeavored to catch your eye
eng_Latn I wish somebody mess
eng_Latn It looks very heavy Pug.
eng_Latn in the fruit you pluck from the tree.
eng_Latn the one coarse word she had used, supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.
eng_Latn I thought, too, of your article in that journal
eng_Latn I couldn't think about what he was suggesting.
eng_Latn what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart
eng_Latn I have done all in my power to oppose it
eng_Latn if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden
eng_Latn gently set it down on the space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide.
eng_Latn Well done, Pug!
eng_Latn I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner time in drawing some little sketches for her use.
eng_Latn My poor paws feel like they re running in circles.
eng_Latn should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved
eng_Latn my heart smote me sorely that
eng_Latn that I received it as a thing wholly new
eng_Latn we turned our attention to our voyage
eng_Latn And the moon enjoyed it too. It slooking much better now!
eng_Latn there's the window and the rod
eng_Latn I'll be very put out with you if you don't let her be.
eng_Latn for whoever had delivered it must have noticed that only three weeks after the death of her husband
eng_Latn dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad
eng_Latn has acknowledged the relationship.
eng_Latn it couldn't possibly be anyone else
eng_Latn We now continue with our tour....
eng_Latn she asked defiantly.
eng_Latn I speak to you
eng_Latn only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him.
eng_Latn with a sardonic giggle confirmed that this was so.
eng_Latn with it all hopes of a consulting practice.
eng_Latn I'm just telling you he didn't try and shoot himself tonight.
eng_Latn at its lower extremity,by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape
eng_Latn now return to your own room.
eng_Latn between something infinitely great and illimitable within him
eng_Latn held himself in readiness to call for help, if necessary.
eng_Latn as presents for his former fellow soldier
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug.
eng_Latn yes I can easily comprehend that
eng_Latn my nurse having set me down
eng_Latn saints in heaven!
eng_Latn supporting himself for a short time on his hind legs
eng_Latn he was not interested or with whom he did not dare to develop a friendship.
eng_Latn then he had visited him once more, a fortnight later.
eng_Latn This must be the dog s tummy. Whatnice food he eats!
eng_Latn now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him.
eng_Latn as he jerked back around toward me.
eng_Latn Dog, I think I'm allergic to doghair in very small spaces!
eng_Latn a remnant of self respect was all that intervened between me and the gulf.
eng_Latn you see I thought maybe I might be able to borrow some from some one too
eng_Latn such, alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery
eng_Latn situated, as every one knows, upon the highest point of the plain of that name
eng_Latn although he was at last undeceived and reconciled to her
eng_Latn I'll tap her loose.
eng_Latn I shall never forget the evening I spent with him.
eng_Latn because, to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority
eng_Latn From now on, when me and the bookshop mice polish the floor, we re going to do it together.
eng_Latn the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence
eng_Latn but then I was sixteen and my daddy made me quit.
eng_Latn had offered him a seat in his carriage
eng_Latn my certainty that everything in my life was in the right place tonight.
eng_Latn in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place
eng_Latn but you can't expect me to have any manners
eng_Latn I gathered that the deserted partner was very angry and threatened proceedings.
eng_Latn if that were all right which I had a secret misgiving was nearly all wrong for
eng_Latn you are quide sure of being well receifed.
eng_Latn we had a glorious still summer's day without a cloud in the blue sky.
eng_Latn because she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over beforehand.
eng_Latn that a time is coming when they will not be afraid any more.
eng_Latn looked over the low parapet.
eng_Latn I managed to turn the tables on him.
eng_Latn because that hatred did not come from his being bad
eng_Latn with the new eyeglasses that gave her an academic air.
eng_Latn they had come for their tools.
eng_Latn I am weary.
eng_Latn as though he had suddenly reached a decision
eng_Latn fear, and the bewildered anxiety to flee
eng_Latn although on this occasion he had been prudent enough not to sign his name.
eng_Latn that he had no heart to say anything more to her.
eng_Latn now lay in agony
eng_Latn it is my philosophy that in order to be successful
eng_Latn because the indignant patient had moved his hand away
eng_Latn then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.
eng_Latn I discovered, by my pocket glass, several islands to the south east.
eng_Latn spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it.
eng_Latn do not think it will be less dear to us
eng_Latn there's no earthly reason why she should be present at all.
eng_Latn _Poetry is all very well for those who have nothing to say_.
eng_Latn the care of her soul over her embroidery in her own boudoir
eng_Latn I laid him down dead.
eng_Latn he broke out into a sweat.
eng_Latn as the selection came to an end
eng_Latn as though an invisible beam of understanding shot between them.
eng_Latn I know who gives your orders.
eng_Latn always patient and in fact is the merchant's confidante.
eng_Latn I reckon we'll find out SOMETHING before we get through.
eng_Latn of my five years residence there.
eng_Latn I haven't got any money
eng_Latn there was a snake beside his chair.
eng_Latn Dog. If you could just...
eng_Latn I paid for what we had drunk, and we made our way to a cheap restaurant, crowded and gay, where we dined with pleasure.
eng_Latn though none of them started
eng_Latn Anything!
eng_Latn for he has not much to lose, after all
eng_Latn that the fellow is innocent
eng_Latn waited until he heard her turn the key.
eng_Latn but he resolved to be quiet for the time and show his resentment later.
eng_Latn give me the papers, and go to bed like a sensible fellow.
eng_Latn the swirling waters took his words
eng_Latn but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.
eng_Latn abutting it a small greengrocer's and next to that a tumble down tobacconist's.
eng_Latn I HAVE to get out of this in some way!
eng_Latn was asking herself what was this now that had so suddenly come upon her
eng_Latn I ain't got nothing on under my trousers.
eng_Latn Who else is in the play?
eng_Latn my master sent for me one morning a little earlier than his usual hour.
eng_Latn Because Dogstar is alive!
eng_Latn bent her face over it and began kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.
eng_Latn able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.
eng_Latn asking me whether the king or queen of that country were thick of hearing.
eng_Latn I'm willing to be shown.
eng_Latn the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny.
eng_Latn while I was sent in to get my tea.
eng_Latn she said when they were ready
eng_Latn till to morrow, he muttered to himself, and you, he added, addressing his visitor
eng_Latn for we must be up early and shall need all the sleep we can get.
eng_Latn I really should make this thing go both ways.
eng_Latn And while you keep them busy I will be able to read!
eng_Latn was determined not to be friends any more or yield in any way
eng_Latn that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody.
eng_Latn he staggered towards the door
eng_Latn he sat near the tail of his own smart mule
eng_Latn I was wondering, could you pleasegive my friend a few tips on art?
eng_Latn obviously heated from galloping.
eng_Latn or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me
eng_Latn that a time is coming when they will not be afraid any more.
eng_Latn if she resists, say I shall come
eng_Latn carrying the baby, who was asleep in the wicker cage covered with gauze.
eng_Latn which she had erected in her thought for a sign of perfect competency in the business of living.
eng_Latn but these differences are common to all savage nations
eng_Latn I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where I had sat, in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my money.
eng_Latn the captain and the rest went directly to the door, with their naked sabres in their hands,
eng_Latn she need not wear that cap any more among her friends.
eng_Latn the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching him.
eng_Latn I can't believe you called me out here to tell me you ate my dog.
eng_Latn she rushed out of the room.
eng_Latn I can't even grasp what that would mean.
eng_Latn for she was incapable of ever loving anyone else in this world
eng_Latn From a magical quest, where me and my brave companions…
eng_Latn he must have another object.
eng_Latn I look up blearily.
eng_Latn he left town after mass.
eng_Latn little while ago I seen a thing in the paper says they need folks to pick fruit.
eng_Latn calling me as she ran.
eng_Latn she replied without really answering him.
eng_Latn because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her.
eng_Latn let us remember this, in time.
eng_Latn which plainly showed how ernest her work had been.
eng_Latn W-what was that?
eng_Latn that he sank down almost dead with fright.
eng_Latn because he wasn't treating him quite as he liked,
eng_Latn how she had flaunted it, teasing him, then withdrawing.
eng_Latn was lost in the gloom above.
eng_Latn in that respect like the coat
eng_Latn he arose saying that he must go, that he had to get up early in the morning.
eng_Latn I'm sure I shall get over it if you'll only do that.
eng_Latn looking around excitedly.
eng_Latn to cheer the hands at the windlass
eng_Latn she bade him be quiet, and to let her go on with her work.
eng_Latn that old woman murdered in our district.
eng_Latn summer lying dormant in unnumbered skeleton trees.
eng_Latn though now and again he remembered my existence and flung me a remark at hazard.
eng_Latn leaving their seats, went up to congratulate the countess
eng_Latn I'm not really authorized to talk about the details of any ongoing investigations.
eng_Latn the circle sank down again and waited.
eng_Latn I must hurry you, so that
eng_Latn I hope you are quite well and have made satisfactory progress at college.
eng_Latn anyone beating him at anything
eng_Latn I cannot say anything definite
eng_Latn I should just kill him now.
eng_Latn we shall see the triumph.
eng_Latn which obviously was being forced upon them and themselves
eng_Latn it couldn't possibly be anyone else
eng_Latn I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.
eng_Latn just you turn it over, as in dooty bound
eng_Latn Look at all those bones!
eng_Latn which, alas,was not as impressive as it might have been.
eng_Latn that there is no enchantment about it at all
eng_Latn driver not achauffeur but a policeman proud in uniform
eng_Latn she didn't even stir as I left.
eng_Latn (gulp) (laughing)
eng_Latn it will amuse you.
eng_Latn which plainly showed how ernest her work had been.
eng_Latn First To admit!
eng_Latn had been taught to pity me.
eng_Latn a door right next to him opened with a bang.
eng_Latn he rather shrieked than said.
eng_Latn Hello. I am Dog and this is Pug.Can we help?
eng_Latn you had only lost your liberty
eng_Latn that of being upset
eng_Latn humbly answered that I was my master's slave.
eng_Latn I can hear her voice now.
eng_Latn I reck'n dey's gwyne to be mighty rough times.
eng_Latn that jugged me for a vagrant.
eng_Latn he was beginning to feel slightly sustained at least
eng_Latn I must know more about it.
eng_Latn the biographer should here call attention to the fact that
eng_Latn something they ate at dinner
eng_Latn Then that is the game we shall play Pug!
eng_Latn I was still listening in thought to her well remembered tones
eng_Latn until at last, one night, came the end.
eng_Latn stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity
eng_Latn therefore when a subsequent gentleman re harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property
eng_Latn began walking up and down the room
eng_Latn then of course my family has also to be considered
eng_Latn perhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your journey.
eng_Latn shielding his eyes with his hand.
eng_Latn I do not think that I shall escape from this place.
eng_Latn was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.
eng_Latn I am not warning you against leaving an address at the post office!
eng_Latn cautiously ventured to suggest
eng_Latn you should find that there is anything else in my power
eng_Latn the summer of 1778, that is nearly twenty three years ago.
eng_Latn the young physician, originally an expert surgeon
eng_Latn to get back to the spring
eng_Latn I was no less afraid of confusing myself.
eng_Latn this present life and passing world suffice to me.
eng_Latn I cannot tell what will happen to me or what will happen to any of us.
eng_Latn has acknowledged the relationship.
eng_Latn What s happening?
eng_Latn with the sole object of offending one another.
eng_Latn mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate
eng_Latn or confirmed by some one who has a right to do so
eng_Latn but they'll have a job proving it, there aren't any casualties.
eng_Latn in its place was only a wooden shelter
eng_Latn as doubtless she would
eng_Latn officers, soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.
eng_Latn Umm Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat will answer your big questions.
eng_Latn while I paused from my sewing
eng_Latn but there must be something else to go with it.
eng_Latn but do what I ask you first
eng_Latn I have advised him to do that.
eng_Latn then I became a thief
eng_Latn to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them together.
eng_Latn suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.
eng_Latn I had beenthinking about it all night, and I realized how badly she would feel
eng_Latn from his childhood on he had been used to treading on the edge of such abysmal depths, and contriving not to topple over.
eng_Latn But it was fun, wasn t it?
eng_Latn but I wish you had.
eng_Latn meant more things than we have space to write out
eng_Latn to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose
eng_Latn listening with breathless interest.
eng_Latn it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner.
eng_Latn I took his glasses and looked at the ship.
eng_Latn as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.
eng_Latn with a smile which petrified the dying man
eng_Latn he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.
eng_Latn from preparing for the future
eng_Latn where three poplars stand near the wall of a vineyard.
eng_Latn I knew it was terrible. I felt that it was, of course.
eng_Latn they move on again.
eng_Latn but he struggled and succeeded in tasting the famous dish.
eng_Latn the monster was not able to overtake the boat.
eng_Latn within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand.
eng_Latn which will give you fresh courage
eng_Latn for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour
eng_Latn see you at the same time, my honored benefactor
eng_Latn There s no danger here.
eng_Latn Excuse me again.
eng_Latn looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.
eng_Latn I durst not interrupt them openly.
eng_Latn before I came down hard on him.
eng_Latn and although the day was brilliant out of doors
eng_Latn I was staying in a hotel.
eng_Latn let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us in these wilds.
eng_Latn that, notwithstanding her precautions
eng_Latn I wanted him dead.
eng_Latn but she did not have the strength to get under it.
eng_Latn you never can go and live in that way.
eng_Latn with these words he advanced to receive the three village lasses
eng_Latn especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.
eng_Latn Hello Pug. Hello Dog.
eng_Latn he had revealed to her duty and the beauty of action.
eng_Latn the moment has now come when we must take another look into it.
eng_Latn unless she were more submissive to his directions than she had shown herself before.
eng_Latn The King was shouting for you MrsMervyn.
eng_Latn not a line, not a word reached me.
eng_Latn they came out of his wand
eng_Latn you remember the little chap at the express office
eng_Latn Right. Ooh. Here, little rabbits! I'm a carrot.
eng_Latn I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it.
eng_Latn you was the first that found me!
eng_Latn I passed through, and I came out again alive!
eng_Latn so how can I hope for divine forgiveness?
eng_Latn may I thank the forty six people
eng_Latn I understood that we must retire, in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep, and we both went up stairs.
eng_Latn the ground a dark cracked waste lightened
eng_Latn almost crumpling beneath the weight of a disapproval she had never known before.
eng_Latn I expect some friends every moment.
eng_Latn You know who we are?!
eng_Latn shaded the candle light with his hand
eng_Latn but a very noble way of erasing the past.
eng_Latn in spite of his devotion to her family and his old friendship with her father.
eng_Latn she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure.
eng_Latn understood to do it so well
eng_Latn not a line, not a word reached me.
eng_Latn down a narrow passageway to an uneven staircase
eng_Latn I've been blabbering non stop for an hour to this complete stranger.
eng_Latn ran at once to aid them.
eng_Latn pleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer.
eng_Latn but at first he astonished them, as he rattled in with his two guns.
eng_Latn Because there are no city lights toget in the way.
eng_Latn I ve never heard cats sing like that before.
eng_Latn with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman,
eng_Latn when he's had the impudence to show it at the last.
eng_Latn I may have to circle the block, madame.
eng_Latn for the day was brief and the day was all.
eng_Latn though he would hardly have borne them from another man.
eng_Latn I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.
eng_Latn but then let it drop like before and sighed.
eng_Latn never lifted her eyes from her book, or asked a single question.
eng_Latn jealousy was his only passion.
eng_Latn she realized that some frightful fancy or hallucination had seized upon him, and that, for the moment, he was at its mercy, body and soul.
eng_Latn I'm relieved I was dreading the return to school.
eng_Latn there must be someone somewhere who had money she could borrow.
eng_Latn because she herself had repeatedly appealed to him fora personal inter view in which
eng_Latn he often laid his ear within two yards of me.
eng_Latn feeling for each step, watching as their campfire receded with agonizing slowness.
eng_Latn Ooh, tasty...but a bit hot as well.
eng_Latn holding his breath
eng_Latn Thank you for the yummy lunch.
eng_Latn he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate, like a private person.
eng_Latn all were arranged in the drawers
eng_Latn this edifice crumbled into dust like the philosophers' edifices.
eng_Latn but mostly they went for five or six.
eng_Latn making up her mind what to do
eng_Latn slightly sprinkled with rain, to get their bread from the heap of coats, he went towards his house.
eng_Latn a pint of bitter and a slab of cold pie, so cold that it's colder than the beer.
eng_Latn I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
eng_Latn tossed the rifle onto the corpse, and walked home.
eng_Latn I called for time out!
eng_Latn they're eating out of cans, they're miserable.
eng_Latn I thought you would be hopeless
eng_Latn that these liveries would cost the wages of two laborers for the summer,
eng_Latn I have a friend who is a school mistress in the provinces.
eng_Latn valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid!
eng_Latn than never to have taken it at all.
eng_Latn not the loathsome killer that I mistakenly believed I was.
eng_Latn I shook the clothes out, snapping them against a tree to beat some of the smell from them.
eng_Latn And here we are in a lovely calmplace we have made in our minds.
eng_Latn for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering.
eng_Latn some spoons andforks and knives and salt and pepper sets
eng_Latn I've been in town two days, and I hain't heard nothing but about you bein' rich.
eng_Latn We re giving Bedtime Baboon a nightoff but we re a little bit behind schedule.
eng_Latn becoming more and more excited
eng_Latn I was trying to be good enough for her.
eng_Latn I'll tell you about it once I'm properly caffeinated.
eng_Latn above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room.
eng_Latn that I might know whether I should find him still living
eng_Latn mother's up the street looking at wands
eng_Latn I'll torment this man nearly into his grave, and then, oh!
eng_Latn took along with him his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.
eng_Latn And they all lived happily ever after. Including the Big Bad Wolf.
eng_Latn giving it a sort of oratorical push.
eng_Latn I have naturally a kind and merry heart.
eng_Latn hands that were plump and yet small.
eng_Latn crossing the road, glided up to him unperceived.
eng_Latn I should like another look.
eng_Latn I'll need hospital treatment when the spell wears off.
eng_Latn for it is impossible to have the heart
eng_Latn Er... Granny Pug.
eng_Latn where, at least, she will never be HIS vassal.
eng_Latn I heard him say it on the telephone.
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder Pug.
eng_Latn I never did see the beat of that boy!
eng_Latn just as matters in there had almost reached a crisis.
eng_Latn I got in on my side and started the car.
eng_Latn sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence, as well as habituate them to vile companions
eng_Latn Please hurry!
eng_Latn I shall be quite well to morrow.
eng_Latn I don't remember any threat uttered by him against his father.
eng_Latn though he would have died rather than admit it.
eng_Latn I make my way slowly back from the tube station to our street.
eng_Latn with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile, he put her in her carriage.
eng_Latn the heavenly stillness only tropical and subtropical latitudes can ever know.
eng_Latn I did not sneak on him, of course, and I made them all keep quiet, so it shouldn't come to the ears of the masters.
eng_Latn so broke the engagement that very night for ever.
eng_Latn Philanthropy ... Lycanthropy ..Aah. Philosophy.
eng_Latn Long have I sought the strange andthe unexplainable. The Loch Ness Monster!
eng_Latn to set forth the valour of my own dear countrymen
eng_Latn only when several voices shouted at
eng_Latn when she could take no more than a passing interest in him.
eng_Latn the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it.
eng_Latn which was broken by the explosion.
eng_Latn that if I wished him to tell me its meaning word for word
eng_Latn I'll run get my drum.
eng_Latn that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here
eng_Latn people going a long journey when they are married.
eng_Latn thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force.
eng_Latn without giving a thought to 'that stupendous invention
eng_Latn pestered him with her attentions
eng_Latn I'm sure he is in excellent health.
eng_Latn you have to have high levels of physical and mental energy.
eng_Latn all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved.
eng_Latn inhabited by the door keeper of the cemetery.
eng_Latn I turned away so that I should not watch him search for an excuse.
eng_Latn I needed time for its consideration.
eng_Latn it shall be together.
eng_Latn who might get a hundred times more by cutting their throats.
eng_Latn which at first and up to now at least had seemed to be drawing them indivisibly together.
eng_Latn so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone.
eng_Latn but just casually, as though he was accustomed to walk that way.
eng_Latn for he is very hard.
eng_Latn the gay tones set my heart at ease.
eng_Latn I'm due to try again tomorrow at the same time.
eng_Latn there they were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.
eng_Latn I must have, I suppose.
eng_Latn capable of healing anything from a rent in the side of a work dog to an ulcer on a human shin.
eng_Latn Zoot allors. I am undone!
eng_Latn though the attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half his men.
eng_Latn at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel walk.
eng_Latn but it is certain that he found the door open when he reached it.
eng_Latn reposes the mere handful of this monster's brain.
eng_Latn it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get to the palace without trampling on any of the people.
eng_Latn for all you had in me is gone.
eng_Latn there was still lightenough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom ofthat yawning pocket.
eng_Latn I cannot say anything definite
eng_Latn often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement
eng_Latn I'm going to have to call it off.
eng_Latn perhaps, because the inspection of what had been done
eng_Latn although his origins were actually never known.
eng_Latn but suddenly he didn't seem to have any insides at all.
eng_Latn I here take a final leave of all my courteous readers
eng_Latn and I will do so this very day.
eng_Latn in three days you will be like him mad enough to tie up
eng_Latn This is a book about a man who was marooned on a desert island. And it is called...
eng_Latn but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.
eng_Latn I must run to rehearsal.
eng_Latn in about three weeks I made a great progress in learning their language.
eng_Latn Quickboys,slide down!
eng_Latn I will do whatever is necessary
eng_Latn I did the wolf answered in a petulant half crowing half cowering voice
eng_Latn she began to control herself.
eng_Latn I felt a sudden jolt of both pride and desire.
eng_Latn she heard the loud bang of a book on the floor
eng_Latn to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions
eng_Latn We can t sit here forever boys.We ll run out of air.
eng_Latn during a party game
eng_Latn asked her to go andget this thousand franc bill changed for him
eng_Latn but I have a roof over my head, and food and some clothes.
eng_Latn I don't want to talk about convicts any more.
eng_Latn for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.
eng_Latn which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services.
eng_Latn it came about that owners no longer worked on their farms.
eng_Latn the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though for his benefit, they had just left.
eng_Latn he had had enough of them
eng_Latn I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting.
eng_Latn she appeared to him to possess a charm which no one else in this room had
eng_Latn Here of course.
eng_Latn waiting for the answer.
eng_Latn was as sharp as though cut by a knife or divided by a high wall.
eng_Latn all th at would be folly
eng_Latn it was a fright of the imagination, a dream of your fancy
eng_Latn to get to sea again.
eng_Latn perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention.
eng_Latn suddenly shot with an arrow from behind, or on either side.
eng_Latn I just remembered that today's my birthday.
eng_Latn I fetched out the gun, and now I was done.
eng_Latn the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted
eng_Latn Well done, Pug. You solved the maze- puzzle, by looking at it differently. Instead of trying to get away from the Minotaur, you followed your nose towards him, and we all made a new friend.
eng_Latn he took up the piece of bread and carefully crumbled it away.
eng_Latn I have no right to enroll myself in the service of a party.
eng_Latn took the long horsewhip from its nail.
eng_Latn but when he came to the surface and beheld the sun of another heaven
eng_Latn so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty two years' service
eng_Latn I explained that in my first report to your associates.
eng_Latn it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation
eng_Latn for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours
eng_Latn the thing was altogether as represented in the circular, or at any rate so the agent had said.
eng_Latn biting with a juicy sound into a cucumber.
eng_Latn began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner
eng_Latn left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress.
eng_Latn in hopes to improve my fortunes.
eng_Latn I longed vainly.
eng_Latn who at that time was seventy two years old
eng_Latn the old man is as surly as a dog.
eng_Latn had brought him to these gloomy shades!
eng_Latn but swung his right foot, which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery.
eng_Latn with the result that about a thousand of them were on hand that evening.
eng_Latn we could live in the house.
eng_Latn RUN!
eng_Latn Thanks to the great artist Pugcasso I have seen the light. This genius has showed me the way.
eng_Latn This looks very seen it somewherebefore -ish!
eng_Latn I must confess, too, that he did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe.
eng_Latn his hands were tied.
eng_Latn But you have mops on your bottoms.Use those!
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn I didn't listen to whatever this made her think
eng_Latn so they nearly always win.
eng_Latn some time I'll tell him so.
eng_Latn sneezed over the first puff, and then began to cough herself.
eng_Latn he might wake everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks
eng_Latn for setting so ill an example to the kingdom
eng_Latn he thought on examining the grasslands that they were worth more, and he fixed the price at twenty five roubles the three acres.
eng_Latn it was about eight feet high, and with a level floor nearly as wide.
eng_Latn I climbed the stairs, three at a time, up to the third floor.
eng_Latn she spent the night turning over in bed and weeping with indignation.
eng_Latn the officers and men would be paid the same.
eng_Latn took a trembling peep.
eng_Latn ending in the mother's sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover
eng_Latn but as suddenly stopped
eng_Latn Those are the names of his friends.
eng_Latn What s a Yeti Granny Pug?
eng_Latn cause those talons hurt.
eng_Latn to spread themselves widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water.
eng_Latn was accustomed to sleeping in the house.
eng_Latn which letter put her into the greatest good humour.
eng_Latn I would reply that fiction is all the better the more it looks like truth
eng_Latn Pug, a questing song please.
eng_Latn it is as much as you can expect of a poor man's daughter.
eng_Latn Step aside, Dog and Pug! Hup!
eng_Latn he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink
eng_Latn Uh...
eng_Latn I need to go to the hospital wing, I think
eng_Latn but she was warmed, not by the story, but by him.
eng_Latn that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever.
eng_Latn that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor, was confirmed.
eng_Latn I was glad to see the dogs there, sitting before the fire
eng_Latn but I was mad
eng_Latn I can't say the same for your two victims.
eng_Latn We were beaten by a koala on a skateboard!?!
eng_Latn she commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.
eng_Latn We re not cold anymore Dog. We re hot!
eng_Latn even now, that had given that blow its sodestructive force.
eng_Latn instead of leaving the door fastened
eng_Latn which had ended wretchedly just when their own lives had come together in that splendour of hopeful love,
eng_Latn whereas there was one visit he was most anxious to make without delay.
eng_Latn more fight in her.
eng_Latn whereof I could never learn the true etymology
eng_Latn with the same fanatical fearlessness with which he had gone preaching to bloodthirsty savages, devoid of human compassion or worship of any kind.
eng_Latn unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting into communication with him.
eng_Latn I watched her body stiffen when she caught sight of the boy waiting for her.
eng_Latn a stupendous capacity for work.
eng_Latn with his tall billycock hat one of those hats they used to wear that were a cross between a top hat and a bowler
eng_Latn but I wish it to be so, if you please, for convenience' sake.
eng_Latn I have no way out of this.
eng_Latn Pug does like facing his fears. And...
eng_Latn sour and introspective, with a perpetual snarl and a malignant eye.
eng_Latn poured out his glass of ale
eng_Latn an I think he's an old dear!
eng_Latn the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation.
eng_Latn so I didn't say anything.
eng_Latn returned the boy, looking wicked.
eng_Latn Time for another quest!
eng_Latn when, sounding with his head in one direction
eng_Latn the ink had not dried up in the inkwell
eng_Latn Hello I'm Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn in tones of bewilderment, despair, resignation.
eng_Latn I'll send for you.
eng_Latn endowed with admirable talents
eng_Latn was nearly died of fright.
eng_Latn indeed it had become difficult for them to continue walking abreast.
eng_Latn as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play
eng_Latn it had always been with her there on the chair where she was sitting
eng_Latn then force myself to turn around
eng_Latn the manager came hurrying toward him.
eng_Latn I want to know so that I can argue with these thoughts.
eng_Latn but of course they won't be able to attend the wedding.
eng_Latn burst from the centre of the crowd
eng_Latn regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.
eng_Latn for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him.
eng_Latn commerce surrounds it with her surf.
eng_Latn which support the balcony, became loosened, and was on the point of falling.
eng_Latn whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of the nuns
eng_Latn no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.
eng_Latn a sprinkling of snow covered the ground
eng_Latn to have both hands as free as possible.
eng_Latn inform them that he wouldn't have that noise repeated.
eng_Latn I wish you courage and success
eng_Latn not talking to each other.
eng_Latn he again seized his trumpet
eng_Latn besides I was not only endowed with the faculty of speech
eng_Latn sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road.
eng_Latn I was still worth something, they thought.
eng_Latn he confessed, it is true, that he had confided his idea to some of his friends
eng_Latn I hope everyone will like my new style.
eng_Latn Where did ye get that hat?
eng_Latn the one who threw her over five years ago,
eng_Latn Then does it say Granny Pug s lunchbox is over there?
eng_Latn bounded on one side by part of the hedge, which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a gate
eng_Latn had a son who went through life wearing loose, baggy trousers and
eng_Latn I'd been a little bit too clever and put my foot in it.
eng_Latn they went away.
eng_Latn I shall be at the cottage this evening
eng_Latn poured out his glass of ale
eng_Latn with theprettiest little rosy face in the world.
eng_Latn I won't stay more than a minute.
eng_Latn cast a surly look over at the pair of them
eng_Latn clyde picked it up and turned it over without being able in any way to fix upon the source.
eng_Latn I will pray for them.
eng_Latn everything else will come right of itself.
eng_Latn his arms locked around my waist and pulled me tight against his body.
eng_Latn he saw only moonlight and shadows.
eng_Latn if the snow was on the ground
eng_Latn while he gazed at her wonderingabout the outcome of all this.
eng_Latn she must not stay here could not even this day
eng_Latn Merry makers...Micky takers...Ah..Record breakers!
eng_Latn I orders ye to give that hat to me!
eng_Latn she dared to recall for the first time the illusory days of that unreal love.
eng_Latn you have scarcely tasted since you began tea.
eng_Latn were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed.
eng_Latn I'm having a few friends down for the weekend
eng_Latn quite out of proportion with the cause a late supper with bachelor friends.
eng_Latn driver not achauffeur but a policeman proud in uniform
eng_Latn because of its incredible power of swimming.
eng_Latn the victims of victims.
eng_Latn after he has grown rich he will give him his soul
eng_Latn B-b-but I can t!
eng_Latn That sounds very exciting Pug.
eng_Latn a community of interests in science kept us so.
eng_Latn whereupon they stole off unperceived.
eng_Latn to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish
eng_Latn I went off the boil in 1916,' I told him.
eng_Latn I'm for putting him out of his troubles.
eng_Latn What happened, Not-So-Great Splendina?
eng_Latn they were like schoolboys after a few hours in school.
eng_Latn which protected my breast!
eng_Latn all was black again.
eng_Latn I've been lamed with orange peel once
eng_Latn if you did, it wouldn't harm you.
eng_Latn where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle
eng_Latn they had mastered the technique, when of course they would be able to earn more.
eng_Latn the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head
eng_Latn but the milk can was a perfect masterpiece.
eng_Latn I'll do anything.
eng_Latn here he showed more audacity than most
eng_Latn her agitation now was amazing.
eng_Latn even though you slept while hearing me
eng_Latn I loped through the thick forest toward them.
eng_Latn I'm going to find the thermostat and turn the heat up.
eng_Latn That s no good. We only eat bamboo.
eng_Latn but there is an inspector who takes his place.
eng_Latn the day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself
eng_Latn particularly as his two comrades would not yield
eng_Latn she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil
eng_Latn Pug, that s not quite what I meant by the lesson of the story.
eng_Latn so he looked his last with a broken and satisfied heart.
eng_Latn but neither of us put words to it.
eng_Latn I pushed the door open
eng_Latn in a little while every sound ceased
eng_Latn the cossacks,troubled by the unusual word comrade
eng_Latn to this old lady, a cette pauvre terrible vieille.
eng_Latn enabled me to find it without difficulty.
eng_Latn yet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me
eng_Latn I am pleased to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year.
eng_Latn pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.
eng_Latn I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as heretofore.
eng_Latn It's a little cold.
eng_Latn he smiled,pitying her.
eng_Latn nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it
eng_Latn he would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish,
eng_Latn afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste
eng_Latn it was the duty of a true wife not to give her husband provocation to quarrel
eng_Latn the sun is one of them.
eng_Latn out of most people's way.
eng_Latn I don't think you'll be laughing then.
eng_Latn had chosen it from the others for his place of residence.
eng_Latn ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar
eng_Latn on the contrary, you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the count's
eng_Latn what they had was secured to your mother and to you.
eng_Latn stay where you are
eng_Latn I made what haste I could to the shore
eng_Latn he went off to get skates.
eng_Latn being seventy miles along the coast and a hundred miles deep into the hinterland.
eng_Latn I don't know what's gotten into me
eng_Latn a cloud came over the sky with him
eng_Latn he simply smiled at me and nodded!
eng_Latn they pursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil after them.
eng_Latn every sense alert
eng_Latn it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket.
eng_Latn had triumphed in the end.
eng_Latn I put it in my mouth for safety
eng_Latn it was the way you
eng_Latn in fact my upper half is almost exactly the shape of a tub.
eng_Latn I'm as by golly liberal as you are religious, anyway!
eng_Latn went to the living room and lit the lamp
eng_Latn you ought to have done thesame!
eng_Latn but its song had no music for me
eng_Latn I felt as if an enormous hand made of air were sweeping me along.
eng_Latn only thought of about three days.
eng_Latn then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to a minute.
eng_Latn you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.
eng_Latn finding them filled with strangers come on here
eng_Latn MY granny - Granny Pug!
eng_Latn for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.
eng_Latn I thought he had a rather singular air.
eng_Latn I have a night's work to do yet.
eng_Latn he had refused with a sign of the head.
eng_Latn I am not likely to fall into mistakes from excess of optimism.
eng_Latn I'd like to do better by you that's all.
eng_Latn he might have the wherewithal to take her.
eng_Latn considering what to say.
eng_Latn we have to lean in to hear.
eng_Latn I recognized the cross street he stared toward.
eng_Latn without speaking to him, of course
eng_Latn do you mean to say that when you could swim five hundred feet to shore afterwards
eng_Latn You kept moving, so this is youkeeping moving.
eng_Latn it was as wet as everything else in the bathroom.
eng_Latn Then I need you to help me win thisrace.
eng_Latn I stepped up into the car and kissed him gently.
eng_Latn he added, accentuating the fact that he had waited.
eng_Latn swayed his head.
eng_Latn I cut gymnasium and took it down to them right after luncheon
eng_Latn I did not ask him anything more.
eng_Latn they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin
eng_Latn r, was in despair at his utter inability
eng_Latn I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown
eng_Latn everything depend on her daughter's inclination.
eng_Latn he was so devoted to her.
eng_Latn Pug, I'm sorry too. By being kanga-rivals look what we ve become.
eng_Latn that everyone would forget about it, and his name would remain unsullied.
eng_Latn for no doubt the giant is dead by this time
eng_Latn for they have no word in their language to express lying or falsehood.
eng_Latn of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened
eng_Latn I didn't bid you good night that evening
eng_Latn I was sure of that.
eng_Latn one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days the golden age of modern literature.
eng_Latn I pulled in hand over hand on the cord
eng_Latn because he was not sure how he wanted the meeting to go.
eng_Latn I shall return
eng_Latn yeh don' have ter be pure blood ter do it.
eng_Latn now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.
eng_Latn but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle.
eng_Latn to keep her house trim and spruce.
eng_Latn as if overwhelmed by a sort of awed happiness
eng_Latn which was circled a number of divans and chairs.
eng_Latn there was no escape except up the cliff.
eng_Latn who could possibly doubt,
eng_Latn put it on the table, beside the untasted tart.
eng_Latn he is very nice. I am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow.
eng_Latn where a horrible crime had been committed
eng_Latn the little town had become a great industrial city.
eng_Latn seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.
eng_Latn or if she was the one he was looking for
eng_Latn ready to shoot me if I should offer to stir.
eng_Latn but was at once panic stricken at what he had said, and blushed.
eng_Latn but neither his name nor his face looked particularly familiar to me.
eng_Latn for he led me back into the house
eng_Latn looked uneasily at each other.
eng_Latn We should look for them together?
eng_Latn Would I Dog? Brace yourself for thrills, spills, action and adventure!
eng_Latn I will now throw the pack into the air and catch your card in my teeth. Uh one! Uh two! Uh three!
eng_Latn it was only by severity that you could keep him within bounds.
eng_Latn made him lighthearted and happy again.
eng_Latn the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny.
eng_Latn lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter
eng_Latn Until we meet again in
eng_Latn I'll tell you afterwards, he said quietly.
eng_Latn adapted to supply aid in graver labors
eng_Latn where I lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight.
eng_Latn I didn't say any more
eng_Latn I know I should clean it more
eng_Latn drawing a deep breath.
eng_Latn rolled over on his back
eng_Latn I am one and you are the other
eng_Latn all the harm and mischief that may come of our quarrel will be put down to your account.
eng_Latn before the hour's out, we shall be boarded.
eng_Latn she was saying.
eng_Latn a witness was called to identify him
eng_Latn until he remembered having spoken of a condition.
eng_Latn he was pretty well laced with brandy or he'd never have had the strength to go through with it all so well.
eng_Latn knocked over his lamp
eng_Latn Greetings seekers of the perplexing and ponderful. Within these pages you will find many things that will make you go...
eng_Latn such is the law of nature.
eng_Latn just matches into needles and that sort of thing.
eng_Latn That’s because it’s a map of the sea. I drew it myself.
eng_Latn before you can come across the room to get it.
eng_Latn I gave her a warning glance she didn't see.
eng_Latn straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle
eng_Latn they all made out afterwards that the fish I'd caught wasn't really a big one.
eng_Latn no one had ever understood you properly
eng_Latn wishing to interfere
eng_Latn he dried them with the back of his hand
eng_Latn she returned to her post of observation and sank into repose again
eng_Latn Certainly, Sire –
eng_Latn our father's heart burst, he never spoke one of the words that filled it.
eng_Latn I had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner
eng_Latn I went on from that.
eng_Latn We now continue with our tour....
eng_Latn it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before.
eng_Latn with the expression of one who expects battle and welcomes it.
eng_Latn I forgot everything but my own amazement.
eng_Latn but he had told them to get lost.
eng_Latn My Name is Rargh and this is Grahhh.
eng_Latn her legs folded under her, her head still hanging weakly over the bowl.
eng_Latn who, repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat
eng_Latn whether she could not detect in him that day a marked change
eng_Latn admiring the set of her gown, envying the curl of her hair
eng_Latn I wisht you could a heerd me sing.
eng_Latn until the sound of his automobile' s backfiring faded at the end of the street.
eng_Latn whom he reposed great confidence
eng_Latn but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husband vindicated
eng_Latn I'm going to have to try to wash it out.
eng_Latn Perhaps there is a way to get all these rabbits back into the hat without using magic.
eng_Latn I believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to accomplish and that is the belief that moves mountains.
eng_Latn you cruel thing, that beyond the commonest civilities nothing has passed!
eng_Latn the bell began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way.
eng_Latn she thought her father did it purposely when she was there
eng_Latn I want the truth, the truth!
eng_Latn some spoons andforks and knives and salt and pepper sets
eng_Latn I'm the servant girl.
eng_Latn pulling up the rug he flung himself back on the pillow.
eng_Latn worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!
eng_Latn he had been refused absolution in the confessional several times
eng_Latn that a man's religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.
eng_Latn for we shall not have been above two hours among these cross roads before we see
eng_Latn where, finding I was not pursued
eng_Latn yielding in time a grateful harvest of good.
eng_Latn he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again
eng_Latn they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms
eng_Latn but you don't need to.
eng_Latn but in the meantime a man had got out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post he held
eng_Latn which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother
eng_Latn I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.
eng_Latn or how a point could be disputable
eng_Latn put it up carefully with mine and your own.
eng_Latn You re very welcome to some of these bamboo stems.
eng_Latn come here, show papa your necklace.
eng_Latn but it must be brought to a head.
eng_Latn though he by no means knew what it was.
eng_Latn who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets
eng_Latn I unwrap this pair of gorgeous pale pink silk knickers.
eng_Latn taking the frail wrist between his fingers, feeling for a pulse.
eng_Latn But now I have a chance to becomesomething better.
eng_Latn I think that I will reserve my opinion till I have more facts to go upon.
eng_Latn which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary
eng_Latn Now, that IS good.
eng_Latn through the door which was now open to receive him
eng_Latn at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might show himself.
eng_Latn now in spirits and now in despondency!
eng_Latn save me again!
eng_Latn I don'tknow about that idea.
eng_Latn when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release
eng_Latn have others be nice to him, too.
eng_Latn even his lips were black
eng_Latn that through thoughtlessness and lack of caution you may cause yourself to be talked about in society.
eng_Latn I can hardly sleep nights since the power went off.
eng_Latn to believe that
eng_Latn How will we know who s captain now?
eng_Latn she and I left the nursery.
eng_Latn not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.
eng_Latn you said it was as good as in my hands
eng_Latn catching my eye and looking away.
eng_Latn if contempt has not banished it from your heart
eng_Latn yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance
eng_Latn had endangered his arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time.
eng_Latn I'm taking you to dinner.
eng_Latn I found him in his study, apparently preparing to go out again
eng_Latn but the surprise it occasioned
eng_Latn a childish, timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.
eng_Latn when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen
eng_Latn it was impossible that they could not find three thousand francs.
eng_Latn pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat down in an armchair and burst into tears.
eng_Latn did I have a chance to hope she might be dreaming of me.
eng_Latn whatever might have been the general's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection.
eng_Latn he pretended not to understand, and turned the conversation.
eng_Latn for our places are hard enough.
eng_Latn but you cannot have heard me.
eng_Latn but it was all confusion.
eng_Latn 5 upon her neck a rope of palm fiber
eng_Latn I leave behind me as a pledge this pin
eng_Latn one to mount direct to heaven, the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal.
eng_Latn the demons get sucked back to their own universe and all will be well with the world.
eng_Latn he shuddered all over with a cold shiver.
eng_Latn I'm not sure I want to find out. Yip.
eng_Latn I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else.
eng_Latn but you have constituted yourself my enemy
eng_Latn the great rogue and rascal that my master and I freed from the chain.
eng_Latn I seen you say no
eng_Latn without reproaching him
eng_Latn enlighten me, and I will then communicate my information to her.
eng_Latn someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite.
eng_Latn he only just got away.
eng_Latn I cry, and flinch as he gives a tiny half smile.
eng_Latn waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take.
eng_Latn I'm gladZilla got what was coming to her.
eng_Latn course of treachery and deception
eng_Latn you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.
eng_Latn but was really obliged to put an end to it
eng_Latn she has given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out.
eng_Latn guiding her with joyful spirit through the tangled complexities of her blood to the very source of her origins.
eng_Latn And it is called Granny Pug s Guide to Mini-Beasts!
eng_Latn but now sure of what she must do.
eng_Latn Dog, where are my socks?
eng_Latn they reflected little upon what a sauce open air sleeping make, too.
eng_Latn I was wrong.
eng_Latn in this position he took an important resolution.
eng_Latn but the hand made no response'dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again.
eng_Latn but you go and hand the sauces.
eng_Latn I will recognize him
eng_Latn like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again.
eng_Latn fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
eng_Latn may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it.
eng_Latn Now... I'm a clown.
eng_Latn moving in an unnaturally straight line
eng_Latn of how he had gone to work, been promoted
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn because shehad said three or four times that if I didn't she would kill her self.
eng_Latn his armour rattled as he fell.
eng_Latn rsula abandoned her.
eng_Latn endeavoring to read her husband's inmost thoughts
eng_Latn also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command
eng_Latn I'm told to getyou, whatever happens, that's all.
eng_Latn but you never take the trouble to understand them.
eng_Latn it's all exhausted, it has all been said over and over again
eng_Latn so that only his eyes and the tip of his nose were visible.
eng_Latn she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn't go on living conventionally
eng_Latn want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided.
eng_Latn that to act in that way would have been almost impossible
eng_Latn found that he was going too far east.
eng_Latn then he walked slowly back the way that he had come
eng_Latn a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her
eng_Latn Adventure IS my middle name.
eng_Latn A proper five-a-day.And I don t mean five chickens,boys!
eng_Latn nobody said anything
eng_Latn then kissed her sister, whose arms encircled her
eng_Latn for every one of the three was clever, well educated, and accomplished.
eng_Latn to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants.
eng_Latn he looked more like a quarterback than a doctor.
eng_Latn Ah! There she is!
eng_Latn but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness.
eng_Latn he first stood and then seated himself
eng_Latn I think it may take more than a biscuit to make me less shouty today.
eng_Latn the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment.
eng_Latn ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship.
eng_Latn he caught her face between his two hands and kissed her
eng_Latn That sounds like a much betterplace to be.
eng_Latn you must never bawl again over anything.
eng_Latn you would stay a little longer than you might wish.
eng_Latn I buried both my hands in his fur.
eng_Latn but I am still trying to improve myself
eng_Latn aimed it a yard on one side on purpose, for fear of hurting him.
eng_Latn whether she would have the courage to go with him so far away?
eng_Latn read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.
eng_Latn they know things'jus' don' let on much.
eng_Latn he was lying on his stomach in bed
eng_Latn but he was clearly distracted.
eng_Latn he liked continuity
eng_Latn we believe that that person should be properly punished.
eng_Latn stopped, right outside the staffroom door.
eng_Latn I can do this!
eng_Latn but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever.
eng_Latn drank to him affectionately.
eng_Latn as in an almost joyful manner he conducted her to the door.
eng_Latn holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.
eng_Latn who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him
eng_Latn for the rich among them are for the most part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our carelessness and indifference.
eng_Latn said she, with a conscious look.
eng_Latn I wallowed in that delusion so long I left it too late, too late!
eng_Latn for evil in that quarter was at hand.
eng_Latn I was staying in a hotel.
eng_Latn I tell you that you shan't enter this house
eng_Latn caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him, smiling.
eng_Latn that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.
eng_Latn about my father's funeral, and the company having their black cloaks put on.
eng_Latn when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress.
eng_Latn not much only two inches an hour but still it rose
eng_Latn one of the first things to be made better is the state of the land and the laborers.
eng_Latn but it had been blocked from view
eng_Latn now it all cuts both ways,
eng_Latn Soon everyone will be wearing myfashionable creations.
eng_Latn I stick out my hand and hail a taxi
eng_Latn she made them all disembark and explore the island
eng_Latn you'll do more for him than you would for someone else
eng_Latn he struggled painfully to his feet
eng_Latn she said, her telephone voice typical of herself, brisk, rather masculine, standing no nonsense, and then not waiting for my answer.
eng_Latn even before the fair had well set in
eng_Latn (cheer)
eng_Latn that if a man's business be very great, and of various kinds
eng_Latn stayed in the gloom of the damp stable.
eng_Latn I warn you that I am going to make a scene for you.
eng_Latn I believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to accomplish and that is the belief that moves mountains.
eng_Latn I've a lot of friends there
eng_Latn was with me this morning immediately after breakfast
eng_Latn his hair in an uproar of love
eng_Latn I tried to remember to be gentle with him, but it was hard work to remember anything in the onslaught of sensation, hard to hold on to any coherent thoughts.
eng_Latn it had been necessary to raise more recruits
eng_Latn but he only consented grudgingly
eng_Latn And it is called...
eng_Latn found her scissors and two sheets of brown paper, and sat down.
eng_Latn the crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed about him
eng_Latn I gave her a small car for her birthday.
eng_Latn the message I give the world is I am a successful woman .
eng_Latn but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably decided.
eng_Latn whoever has said or will say anything else must be drunk.
eng_Latn grabbed her and pulled her to the surface.
eng_Latn came running at the carriage
eng_Latn it had never occurred to me that he would have any reason to avoid HER, or to trouble her with family explanations.
eng_Latn how blind is he who cannot see through a sieve.
eng_Latn he swallowed its contents at one draught.
eng_Latn there was a magnificent, dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil over all.
eng_Latn But how can I ever put all these pages back in the right books? There s so many.
eng_Latn found himself gazing into a pair of lamp like yellow eyes.
eng_Latn under such solemn circumstances,
eng_Latn so that while the short lower part is still fast
eng_Latn therefore, don't expect him to play and run about with you directly.
eng_Latn I don't know if I should keep staying with you.
eng_Latn but something was holding them down.
eng_Latn that he had never been cheated out of one pound.
eng_Latn but the victims had to be gullible.
eng_Latn but to each of us he has given the responsibility of NAVIGATION.
eng_Latn for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering.
eng_Latn when he laid his hand upon my arm.
eng_Latn g and looked hard at me.
eng_Latn I was wrong.
eng_Latn began with a stately air to march up and down in front of the trough
eng_Latn he reminded me, his voice exultant
eng_Latn but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture.
eng_Latn he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.
eng_Latn turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed
eng_Latn Sadly they were not the dogsdinners.
eng_Latn We must find a way of making ourselves warmer.
eng_Latn it returned to the stammer of acharter.
eng_Latn as I held them up
eng_Latn but there the similitude ceases.
eng_Latn upon a death in a large city
eng_Latn Strange... can t see it anywhere.Let's take a look around.
eng_Latn they're on their way west already
eng_Latn she kept cutting across him, forcing him to change direction.
eng_Latn to appease the mob I gave them a victim
eng_Latn because it seems to me that she is the one who has to decide.
eng_Latn the witness must have seen that?
eng_Latn who ought to be treated with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity, by us their inferiors.
eng_Latn People think I'm scary? Oh maybe that s why nobody come to my tea shop.
eng_Latn but as my sole intention was the public good
eng_Latn I put my fingers into his.
eng_Latn not omit reporting even a porpoise.
eng_Latn an' you can make up your mind to it to be down below waitin' on the counter.
eng_Latn I wouldn't let you operate on me!
eng_Latn thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow
eng_Latn seeing as I know what I owes you.
eng_Latn whom I have brought up with the love of a father
eng_Latn though he had been informed, to begin with, that she had already gone to bed.
eng_Latn the newcomer recoiled from this company.
eng_Latn who had called to say that the dinner would take place as proposed.
eng_Latn whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket.
eng_Latn I do wish we had found the Yeti though. I d like it to be real.
eng_Latn had not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.
eng_Latn there had come to him one noontime a man who was employed as a night watchman
eng_Latn for I much desired to speak with him again.
eng_Latn each possessed of the anlage of movement.
eng_Latn her mother answered with a wave of her whip.
eng_Latn how she ever got her present job was a mystery.
eng_Latn F-f-fall?
eng_Latn but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it
eng_Latn The end
eng_Latn but perhaps that's part of your charm.
eng_Latn I know nothing about it and won't begin proceedings
eng_Latn for no time was lost in procuring her former place beside the croupier.
eng_Latn that he would never again be able to _speak_ of anything to anyone.
eng_Latn I can't help what happens to you.
eng_Latn simply because she was old and poor and had few friends.
eng_Latn Oooo s that trip-trapping over my bridge?!
eng_Latn he wrote steadily for fifty minutes
eng_Latn I was rather an ugly little boy
eng_Latn as to leave us here.
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all...
eng_Latn for that she should be frightened and run away.
eng_Latn I haven't a cent in my pockets, and nothing to do.
eng_Latn he stopped and turned about and watched it until it disappeared.
eng_Latn expressed a feeling of hatred and contempt, and she tried to avoid meeting him.
eng_Latn from which he was awakened by the light of a candle
eng_Latn the news stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill.
eng_Latn but with eyes still cast down, soon went on.
eng_Latn he never saw anybody
eng_Latn it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky.
eng_Latn it very much remains to be seen but at least we can get together and try.
eng_Latn I am a selfish girl!
eng_Latn when he tripped headlong over something
eng_Latn If we had our head torches it wouldbe much easier to find them.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer!
eng_Latn then fell swamping back into the deep.
eng_Latn when I've told you every single little thing about me.
eng_Latn I pinched her lips together between my thumb and finger.
eng_Latn then, when they had passed
eng_Latn I have such trouble about it.
eng_Latn I felt sure of that, or I should not have come to you.
eng_Latn I heard her slap the salt pork in the pan a good time ago.
eng_Latn she watched from between her knees.
eng_Latn the practicante endeavoured to conceal his guitar hastily
eng_Latn carefully adjusting her big straw hat so her face and neck were well shaded.
eng_Latn so far as her virginal emotions went
eng_Latn I'll stick to whisky if you don't mind.
eng_Latn lead him to a great achievement and great happiness.
eng_Latn I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!
eng_Latn we can die but once
eng_Latn doubtless it is chance
eng_Latn various subjects for annotation have presented themselves
eng_Latn which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.
eng_Latn Let's take it to her!
eng_Latn until I saw it in the dying boy.
eng_Latn I've been living in the forest ever since
eng_Latn with their help he will by his own exertions reach the summit of polite literature
eng_Latn Objectives... Perspectives... Detectives!
eng_Latn it was so tied up with love and dreams, tears and loneliness
eng_Latn take any position which he describesas having been taken by her.
eng_Latn but knowing that all was ready for flight I thought you might have made your escape
eng_Latn she concluded, laying her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven.
eng_Latn I tried to tell you folks, he said.
eng_Latn but the cold voice was speaking again
eng_Latn I balled up the sweater to use instead.
eng_Latn I have my wife with me and a couple of boxes.
eng_Latn should now investigate his parents andhis past?
eng_Latn went off the sidewalk into the gutter, and sat down hard.
eng_Latn he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him.
eng_Latn I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further.
eng_Latn recognized her brother in law, and ran down to meet him.
eng_Latn much discourse passed between him and his friend concerning me
eng_Latn some further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him rather dumbfoundered
eng_Latn I thought you would be hopeless
eng_Latn he raised his arms to embrace his daughter good night.
eng_Latn I didn't mean to say anything.
eng_Latn the wind was so strong, that we were driven directly upon it.
eng_Latn carrying the baby, who was asleep in the wicker cage covered with gauze.
eng_Latn they sat down at the same time on their pots eleven times in a single day
eng_Latn with this peculiar feature, that they were always at his immediate disposal
eng_Latn he was to get the owner's signature and mail me the lease last night.
eng_Latn My biscuits!
eng_Latn maybe'it was something to do with'you know'her crowd.
eng_Latn whose arms are like the masts of mighty ships
eng_Latn I can't, I feel so queer!
eng_Latn I am dreadfully afraid.
eng_Latn the rest, and the block house itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered
eng_Latn if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.
eng_Latn I don't care what your last name is!
eng_Latn I am going away soon, I expect.
eng_Latn I looked into my still full coffee cup.
eng_Latn but it was enough.
eng_Latn he air he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in prison
eng_Latn she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den a goblin's cell.
eng_Latn that his left eye could see her face he calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds.
eng_Latn but to try to put the blame on her sister!
eng_Latn hundreds of homes resounding with their footsteps.
eng_Latn the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head.
eng_Latn I had no time to try my other pistol
eng_Latn despite the fact that the only affinity between the two was their addiction to chess
eng_Latn stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him
eng_Latn I've gone through life like a bat out of hell
eng_Latn having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.
eng_Latn if she comes out, as I know she will, victorious from this struggle
eng_Latn you must be entirely devoid of them
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn it will bring bad luck.
eng_Latn I took particular notice of him this time
eng_Latn that we are worthy of compassion.
eng_Latn only once and for the minimum time necessary
eng_Latn as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical
eng_Latn I hoped she wasn't so dissatisfied that she would skip the questions I was waiting for.
eng_Latn the entire middle section was a feature on the war.
eng_Latn having gained which strategic position, however, he stopped and looked back to see if he might hope for pardon.
eng_Latn I can't tell you.
eng_Latn yet, ten to one, let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commander's cabin
eng_Latn because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound
eng_Latn that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.
eng_Latn making sure it was licensed and insured.
eng_Latn when we shall catch him, no doubt.
eng_Latn But not on this ship.
eng_Latn she knew when the milk was about to boil.
eng_Latn I wasn't back from the war.
eng_Latn with all his might, made off after him, book in hand.
eng_Latn thought when the lift bumped on the ground
eng_Latn at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind.
eng_Latn as affording me the means of increasing my stock of pens
eng_Latn they said this drownded man was just his size
eng_Latn pulled on his cloak for warmth
eng_Latn should be alive
eng_Latn many thousands of pounds already in the bank in your own name
eng_Latn Well done Pug. You are stronger than you think.
eng_Latn to enjoy the sport of the search.
eng_Latn I'm like to look sharpish.
eng_Latn Many thanks, my canine chums. It worked like a charm.
eng_Latn I had a cup of coffee and asandwich.
eng_Latn Hey Diddle Diddle is an old English rhyme hundreds of years old, though no one is quite sure how it started
eng_Latn for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice
eng_Latn I thought I was dying in my sleep last night.
eng_Latn I read the note
eng_Latn lay down flat on his stomach and crawled alongon top of the wall as far as the cant.
eng_Latn if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it.
eng_Latn capable, as heretofore, of continual improvement by anything he said.
eng_Latn might have even struck her on that lone, secret lake!
eng_Latn for I will satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest.
eng_Latn like a sudden entrance into something new and strange, whose splendour terrified him.
eng_Latn then lifted his lip
eng_Latn could scarcely restrain herself from crying out the whole story
eng_Latn I served out the explosives to the fifteen porters, and we started.
eng_Latn repeated, while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.
eng_Latn if it had not been for your worship
eng_Latn I'll come tomorrow.
eng_Latn did me the honour to dine with me.
eng_Latn then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.
eng_Latn I had to run to keep pace with him, catching at my breath, tears very near the surface
eng_Latn laid down on my traveller's bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
eng_Latn I, too, have had a moonlight soul.
eng_Latn though I couldn't remember where in town I'd seen him before.
eng_Latn though it be with her pip, live
eng_Latn but decided not to.
eng_Latn half fearing that she really shrank from speedy marriage.
eng_Latn on our victuals and our drink.
eng_Latn bur our family affairs are our own.
eng_Latn (giggling) Oh! Oh That tickles!
eng_Latn flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor.
eng_Latn observed that one of the things wherein the ancient philosophers
eng_Latn ...someone has been drawing in!?
eng_Latn now I die
eng_Latn I can do igloos!
eng_Latn if it were not enough we were to let her know
eng_Latn come to security.
eng_Latn half ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief.
eng_Latn It's over there Holmes.
eng_Latn And it is called...
eng_Latn I get exhausted just watching her
eng_Latn it nearly made him pass out again.
eng_Latn he may never feel certain of not losing himself again.
eng_Latn when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you
eng_Latn we all thought it such a SHAME when that horrible woman was going round telling those stories about you.
eng_Latn for the man to disappear or assume some other forM
eng_Latn but he was wrong
eng_Latn as if within herself she was marshaling every resource she possessed not to scream.
eng_Latn regarded it broodingly.
eng_Latn sunrise to sunset.
eng_Latn You really think so?
eng_Latn he was unwilling to leave it untranslated
eng_Latn you, darling child, shall come to us!
eng_Latn first bowing profoundly
eng_Latn do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience
eng_Latn I hope you find a chair.
eng_Latn being uncommonly shaggy and thick
eng_Latn I may learn to value you as you deserve.
eng_Latn not until you hear further from me.
eng_Latn was lean and stooped somewhat
eng_Latn its spirit spent.
eng_Latn while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement.
eng_Latn a recent instance of his goodness rose vividly to her mind.
eng_Latn one he had rushed into for fear that the opportunity would never be repeated.
eng_Latn My word.
eng_Latn but never mind that my boy go and announce your arrival and let her know all your hopes and prospects
eng_Latn expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it in.
eng_Latn I asked him the same question.
eng_Latn I answered in few words, but to no purpose.
eng_Latn returned to the bedside
eng_Latn I jumped after him.
eng_Latn I should forget about it.
eng_Latn in all countries where they preside
eng_Latn I'm taking you to dinner.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder mice?
eng_Latn that gazing on it, in that full front view
eng_Latn I have to take mine.
eng_Latn made hisway to this hotel in his very best clothes.
eng_Latn found the articles named, and returned with them.
eng_Latn perhaps it saw dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.
eng_Latn I think we had better start again.
eng_Latn please don't apologize.
eng_Latn Look!
eng_Latn here and there old seamen were basking in the sun.
eng_Latn I thought he would help me.
eng_Latn even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever
eng_Latn which had been built by him and for him alone.
eng_Latn to believe that
eng_Latn cautiously ventured to suggest
eng_Latn the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the beaver
eng_Latn seeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again
eng_Latn just before we lost sight of them behind the little point
eng_Latn no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety
eng_Latn he refused anything except the least expensive
eng_Latn but a determined woman.
eng_Latn thought his head would burst with the pain.
eng_Latn now tell me, which is the greater work, to bring a dead man to life or to kill a giant?
eng_Latn A very big elephant. And I'm hisfriend Janice.
eng_Latn he'd lodged you here!
eng_Latn I closed it, and returned to my post.
eng_Latn YOU know his tavern was all right
eng_Latn I I have no wish to leave you, none at all
eng_Latn for her, every day was the same, and when each day is the same as the next,
eng_Latn he was not diminutive
eng_Latn looking at her sister in law
eng_Latn Yeh. Aarh Wheh Ah
eng_Latn I had many enemies, and all because of the children.
eng_Latn I take this boy to the hospital wing!
eng_Latn from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state
eng_Latn entreated him to leave the place at once
eng_Latn while the cavernous thundering of the gombo went on without a pause.
eng_Latn I can't wait to let go.
eng_Latn you have lived until now without a government
eng_Latn so, three times they come out right, and three times they come out wrong.
eng_Latn how he had learned to swim here.
eng_Latn she obliged me, by constant worrying, to walk with her down through the grounds to meet them.
eng_Latn we will go away at once, and there will be an end of the matter.
eng_Latn I mean from the love you bear
eng_Latn they will come!
eng_Latn he provincial home again he would settle in some provincial town as a general practitioner
eng_Latn no one had promised them.
eng_Latn turn out the light when you come back to bed
eng_Latn there are no other means of getting at it.
eng_Latn you must stop dat dam racket!
eng_Latn Wow the Owl actually.
eng_Latn expressed a desire to go and milk her.
eng_Latn I'm not sure I'm the right personto be giving advice. Nobody round here seems to like my work.
eng_Latn then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them.
eng_Latn there is bad literature
eng_Latn then he suddenly came a week ago and he began about it straight away.
eng_Latn I therefore hoped they would not treat me as an enemy
eng_Latn but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze,nevertheless.
eng_Latn I cleared it and told him I'd written a story.
eng_Latn she hurried into the room alone
eng_Latn with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
eng_Latn I suppose he would be about sixty five
eng_Latn standing my boots right and left in the first dancing position,
eng_Latn snatched up a stone that he found near him
eng_Latn then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook,
eng_Latn I told him to shut up and he never even looked at me.
eng_Latn MY granny - Granny Pug!
eng_Latn she exclaimed, launching a penny steamer so vigorously
eng_Latn it cannot be more
eng_Latn W-what was that - and that – and that?
eng_Latn Hey, you.
eng_Latn I ll catch you Kanga-loser!
eng_Latn dressed in black garments that showed only their eyes.
eng_Latn fall, leaped from his horse
eng_Latn the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke
eng_Latn you begged me not to leave
eng_Latn the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field.
eng_Latn tis a song you should be knowing, me lad.
eng_Latn I need not stop here to relate.
eng_Latn if they were hoping to sell to the public.
eng_Latn both my fear and my hope proved ill founded.
eng_Latn It's not just me in a cardboard box then?
eng_Latn when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town
eng_Latn for they were soaked through
eng_Latn I nodded and opened the container.
eng_Latn but only as a silent witness.
eng_Latn he laid the knuckles of the right hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the hollow of the right
eng_Latn you see, it would be your own business.
eng_Latn I told him, that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my way
eng_Latn I, of course, threw it all on my destiny
eng_Latn I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it.
eng_Latn besides that, we had two able allies rum and the climate.
eng_Latn how I was going to have this baby
eng_Latn they put a pile of dry hay in the middle of the street
eng_Latn asked her how that trunk had come into our hands, and what there was in it.
eng_Latn that is the good of having a brother instead of a husband.
eng_Latn the sultry air, the shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd
eng_Latn went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
eng_Latn to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick.
eng_Latn but failing now that he had reversed the handle.
eng_Latn here another self came in.
eng_Latn his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished.
eng_Latn riddled with pain
eng_Latn but then, you will not be allowed to enter churches
eng_Latn where, as I still stood motionless
eng_Latn gold embroidery, who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance
eng_Latn which will not yield if after careful deliberation youfind you are wrong.
eng_Latn I thought the place for an able bodied man was in the fighting line.
eng_Latn overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool
eng_Latn followed her into a bookshop
eng_Latn What a beautiful garden Dog.
eng_Latn if we do not know more than we have told you, as my comrade and I
eng_Latn but these did not impress him.
eng_Latn but with the boy followed him to the house.
eng_Latn to go and fetch my child!
eng_Latn it happened there was no danger
eng_Latn the reader is to observe, that they were first introduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning
eng_Latn so I go straight up to the door and knock.
eng_Latn I never suggested that we should all rush into work for which we are unfitted.
eng_Latn for he had remarked with particular attention the manner in which it had been told
eng_Latn between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank.
eng_Latn prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made.
eng_Latn has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance
eng_Latn they asked him where the treasure was.
eng_Latn what an enormous perspective I make of it!
eng_Latn but I am awfully fond of children, too.
eng_Latn having purloined a considerable sum of public money
eng_Latn they examined all, talked of everything till to the end of dinner.
eng_Latn from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.
eng_Latn This is a book about people putting on a play a long time ago and it's called...
eng_Latn he rolled over in the air, clutching his broom, completely winded.
eng_Latn the house lay before us.
eng_Latn I'm not bisexual, either!
eng_Latn I thought all this very pretty and engaging
eng_Latn I was but am now back again
eng_Latn that he had been an assiduous participant in the annual competition
eng_Latn I ll save you!
eng_Latn in our cell we gave him the paper to read
eng_Latn Hello, I'm another Magic Pencil.
eng_Latn holding me standing before him
eng_Latn I…T-t-they might be giants?
eng_Latn I stared into his eyes and heard my own voice for the first time.
eng_Latn And kind.
eng_Latn they sat down.
eng_Latn I didn't know if you'd be able to keep it from her, promise or not.
eng_Latn when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land locked gulf
eng_Latn though he would have died rather than admit it.
eng_Latn All the better for adventure Pug.
eng_Latn No. No. Please don t do that!
eng_Latn I only want to be consulted sometimes.
eng_Latn I'd almost as soon strike a woman as you.
eng_Latn I want to stay here and watch a movie.
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder, Dog?
eng_Latn his nationality would also be given in the answer.
eng_Latn he stood head and shoulders above the rest.
eng_Latn but ask me why I think so, and I can tell you nothing.
eng_Latn she promised to explain matters, and I departed.
eng_Latn encouraging eyes upon him.
eng_Latn I thought I heard a horse.
eng_Latn Let's check out the band!
eng_Latn they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree, and slipped in behind it, and so they had the bulge on the men again.
eng_Latn meanwhile, the pitched battle below was nothing to the one taking place above.
eng_Latn I shall be at the cottage this evening
eng_Latn pointing to the boy, made my master to understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be pardoned.
eng_Latn but commonplace is precisely what I felt he was not.
eng_Latn Surrender or be surrendered!
eng_Latn Surviving the Darkness - Lifebefore Electricity.
eng_Latn but it had been a narrow escape
eng_Latn I am a prisoner, then?
eng_Latn unless the purchase is less than 10 per cent of the company's stock
eng_Latn but she stopped him with an impulse typical of her character.
eng_Latn there was another loud rap on the door.
eng_Latn it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and envious glance of an owl at two turtle doves
eng_Latn do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself?
eng_Latn hear me out!
eng_Latn rather my job was to find out whether any stores existed.
eng_Latn that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness.
eng_Latn Granny Pug, do rocks havetentacles?
eng_Latn I don't know what that means
eng_Latn because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return
eng_Latn marry her to her equal
eng_Latn leaving his young friend asleep, with her head upon the table.
eng_Latn Now that we re facts the Factoids want to pack us in boxes too!
eng_Latn his head was still pounding with the conversation he had just heard.
eng_Latn reached that turf alley which nearly makes the circuit ofthe hill
eng_Latn they were probably having a tough time not ripping the cup away from her.
eng_Latn whichhave a tricolored cockade for an eye.
eng_Latn I grabbed for its throat with a pitifully weak human hand and missed.
eng_Latn but I do not wonder so much at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire
eng_Latn then I gave a cry of exultation
eng_Latn on account of the baby and all, not to marry her
eng_Latn then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket
eng_Latn giving them the tufted look of a lynx's ears.
eng_Latn you're like the weather cock on a roof.
eng_Latn You shall go to the building site!
eng_Latn he asked sullenly.
eng_Latn then returned to stand behind him and watched him paint.
eng_Latn I have brought a spare uniform.
eng_Latn she hid her distress too well.
eng_Latn he still slept, a doctor was summoned.
eng_Latn I didn't have time to ask him what he meant by that.
eng_Latn she ran to him.
eng_Latn (giggling) Hello, Pug ... would you mind distracting him with a leaf?
eng_Latn that I determined upon sacrificing every thing to it.
eng_Latn when found, may, for all I know, fly in his own face.
eng_Latn set up on a stump at them foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun.
eng_Latn grew in the dooryard and up against the house, and the cotton was about the shed barn.
eng_Latn Ready, Dog?
eng_Latn mount thy ass and follow them quietly
eng_Latn I don't want you to do anything you're not sure about.
eng_Latn but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before.
eng_Latn I have her unlisted number for you, if you want it.
eng_Latn there were no witnesses.
eng_Latn again the shock came and he was brought crushingly to the ground.
eng_Latn should of course profit by that notion.
eng_Latn so I go straight up to the door and knock.
eng_Latn You re back. You re back. You re back Dog.
eng_Latn Because something will always make it stop.
eng_Latn we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.
eng_Latn therefore I shall confess and await forgiveness.
eng_Latn remained silent for some time.
eng_Latn he faltered mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes.
eng_Latn declared it was time to go.
eng_Latn that it had dislocated the shoulder of the first driver.
eng_Latn they examined all, talked of everything till to the end of dinner.
eng_Latn I kept an eye on her through the paramedics' thoughts.
eng_Latn No. I am definitely NOT a leaf!
eng_Latn get it out of your head entirely that this can be settled in any way but marriage.
eng_Latn I thank you for the pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.
eng_Latn it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told.
eng_Latn there was a flabby perspiration on the walls.
eng_Latn as soon as you had finished dressing.
eng_Latn all four of them crept towards the dining room door
eng_Latn had come home.
eng_Latn yet not so high as to appear haughty.
eng_Latn he had made a full and candid confession.
eng_Latn such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.
eng_Latn in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar.
eng_Latn that had never happened before.
eng_Latn No. Those are MY tyre tracks. I didall the work. I'm the best worker who ever worked work ever!
eng_Latn Dog! Dog! I need your help.
eng_Latn but not so quickly that she didn't see the stunned happiness come up in his eyes.
eng_Latn but for firteen you get 'ot chocolate
eng_Latn but as far as I know the facts, I can't.
eng_Latn haven't the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about.
eng_Latn his own first mate to be offered a minimum six month contract as the new skipper
eng_Latn which affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island to the other.
eng_Latn I didn't ask her to do that.
eng_Latn I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand.
eng_Latn as became a pirate
eng_Latn his fatherhaving been a small town dry goods merchant before him, who hadfailed
eng_Latn (LAUGHING) Now MY brain hurts Dog!
eng_Latn someone who, unlike his wife, was a fellow scientist and would under stand the problem.
eng_Latn I turned, and then wished I hadn't.
eng_Latn because we add those bits last
eng_Latn Aha! Just the story we need. Long had the Earth s mightiest superheroes fought crime and injustice together.
eng_Latn till their memories were again roused by their flappers
eng_Latn nothing to bother about in the army except getting killed.
eng_Latn without a word, waiting for him to speak.
eng_Latn but whatever else remained the same
eng_Latn I told her about your parents and said that's what was wrong with you.
eng_Latn then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition.
eng_Latn I wanted to kick myself when I realized how much I'd been counting on that loathsome vampire.
eng_Latn love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul.
eng_Latn Could Pug use you to draw a treetoo please?
eng_Latn especially if it be anything in which I have a part.
eng_Latn she watched the bottle clandestinely.
eng_Latn which had been the family mansion for over a century
eng_Latn therefore better than she had expected.
eng_Latn pursued the unfortunate baronet
eng_Latn two old people, ambushed by death
eng_Latn except that a long time ago his ex wife had said it to him.
eng_Latn I shall never be grown up as long as I live.
eng_Latn at last I gained the summit.
eng_Latn warned me to keep my mouth shut.
eng_Latn screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head
eng_Latn I gave him a sufficient dose of veronal to insure his unconsciousness for several hours.
eng_Latn nor scratch, before folks
eng_Latn maybe you think I'm gettin' above myself, speakin' first
eng_Latn Oops.
eng_Latn Slapping on the...
eng_Latn how can you justify your leaving that girl in that lake
eng_Latn Oh, I ve made up dozens just like it.
eng_Latn you slug hell out of them
eng_Latn her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves.
eng_Latn I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.
eng_Latn even then the whipcord breeches weren't altogether out of my mind.
eng_Latn there is that whichit is simply necessary to elucidate and examine.
eng_Latn he is generous, without prodigality and wasting
eng_Latn I was not half afraid at the time of its being so,
eng_Latn but I soon observed
eng_Latn I shook my head.
eng_Latn I was mad at myself now for having made the plans.
eng_Latn but could scarcely move or speak
eng_Latn she thanked them all for having entertained her so well.
eng_Latn I pop up the ladder every now and then for a breath of fresh air.
eng_Latn then he disappeared
eng_Latn Wow-Bowzer! Puzzle completed.
eng_Latn you'll not do anything now but just go home and wait until you're really sure.
eng_Latn in my own time and way.
eng_Latn what made his death the more sad was that
eng_Latn therein justified the good thoughts you have of him.
eng_Latn you must not be angry with us if we go to extremities.
eng_Latn I walked about, before you came, a great deal for me.
eng_Latn I was in a great hurry to get home, and didn't see you were coming.
eng_Latn the upshot of their conversation was that the breach is quite healed
eng_Latn began to take on anexpression such as they had never worn before.
eng_Latn when, looking all around to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's shanty
eng_Latn so they began looking for him
eng_Latn the obligatory withdrawal and they separated for a time.
eng_Latn I don't read him that way, she said.
eng_Latn Dog s inner Dog actually.
eng_Latn for the corn could go, as long as something else remained.
eng_Latn it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.
eng_Latn became in time a truly useful and noble institution.
eng_Latn to die in the same way within a year of each other.
eng_Latn thence turned to the left
eng_Latn hers for him was that she was indeed trifling with fire
eng_Latn halted, spoke to the commander of the regiment, and rode up the hill to the guns.
eng_Latn as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only
eng_Latn Thank-you Granny Pug.
eng_Latn for I very well know that I am a weak, light, girlish creature
eng_Latn That is magic AND a real unicorn Pug.
eng_Latn we might be interrupted in the most interesting part of my story which would be a pity
eng_Latn I couldn't see.
eng_Latn when all the rest of us didn't know where our next meal was coming from.
eng_Latn then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seizedit.
eng_Latn we'll pick a lop management team to back him up.
eng_Latn but couldn't say much more
eng_Latn the ink had not dried up in the inkwell
eng_Latn thrown it in the lake here, maybe, with a stone in it?
eng_Latn at last espied me as I lay on the ground.
eng_Latn I love life.
eng_Latn I have told you my wish
eng_Latn then came a sudden heavy fall of rain that lasted for nearly four days
eng_Latn when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture.
eng_Latn And lead the rabbits back into your magic hat.
eng_Latn money to eat
eng_Latn I went out and found them by the mill.
eng_Latn Well done, Pug! They jumped out because they wanted to!
eng_Latn which he found a hard command.
eng_Latn He s the best?
eng_Latn expecting in a little to cross the line.
eng_Latn nothing as yet.
eng_Latn but that when he came back he would not stir all winter.
eng_Latn he called to the baronet to join him there.
eng_Latn but the true hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.
eng_Latn fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond.
eng_Latn he begging she would remain another half hour, at least.
eng_Latn GRANNY PUG? GRANNY PUG?
eng_Latn you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct
eng_Latn remarkably well tended for a farmer's hands.
eng_Latn besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate
eng_Latn crowned him with his speckled straw hat.
eng_Latn but she meant to live as she pleased.
eng_Latn I beseech you to let me bring him here.
eng_Latn having now the leisure to look around, let her eyes roam in delight.
eng_Latn but at that moment I was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge.
eng_Latn that he was destined to do something for his people.
eng_Latn brought to my recollection her former illness, and the doctor's injunction that she should not be crossed.
eng_Latn several among them having died since my confinement.
eng_Latn I'll go directly and you may be sure I won't be in your way.
eng_Latn until that man was dead
eng_Latn It was something people believed along time ago.
eng_Latn she's well she does not want any more attendance from you!
eng_Latn seeing it was no use
eng_Latn then, when they had passed
eng_Latn found equally agreeable again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come
eng_Latn OR any people at this picnic.
eng_Latn Dog! Dog! Something very strange has happened to my new recipe book!
eng_Latn I know the answer to many riddles.
eng_Latn I felt a pang of unease.
eng_Latn but he said it as quietly and respectfully
eng_Latn the discovery that he did so delighted them.
eng_Latn our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.
eng_Latn advancing to the bed's head
eng_Latn which meant she had to sit leaning forward in order to read.
eng_Latn but at close quarters it's almost impossible.
eng_Latn I had a sudden desperate yearning to get off with her.
eng_Latn as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal substance
eng_Latn your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man and that this is certain, CERTAIN!
eng_Latn he roared and looked about him positively like a lion.
eng_Latn but she thrashed and knocked it onto the floor with a hollow bonging sound which he also couldn't hear.
eng_Latn dressed in shoes and light summer trousers.
eng_Latn I wrote my name, threw it at him and ran away.
eng_Latn but had yielded them up at last, after many years
eng_Latn but was too timid to ask it.
eng_Latn I bet it is.
eng_Latn therehad been no time to make a palisade for it.
eng_Latn he perceived his carriage
eng_Latn I think our imaginations can ask questions like that one forever!
eng_Latn then he felt solid ground beneath his feet
eng_Latn especially since this had been a very dear season for cucumbers.
eng_Latn or that from some consideration of policy she should be allowed to suppose herself so.
eng_Latn I shall never be a man of renown.
eng_Latn however, than that of scratching nearly all the skin off their hands.
eng_Latn lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf
eng_Latn I'm curious to find out.
eng_Latn If you d like to climb aboard...
eng_Latn they had had more than enough of fighting.
eng_Latn I will not be the foundation of another man's fortune.
eng_Latn folded and sealed with a woman's elegant care.
eng_Latn at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships
eng_Latn villainy were practised
eng_Latn A fantastic factory owned by thatmaster biscuiteer, Billy Barker.
eng_Latn but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.
eng_Latn but there was no bag, and neither hat nor cloak.
eng_Latn that simply smote thee from blindest instinct!
eng_Latn for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house
eng_Latn if anything happens to you to day, turn to me before any one!
eng_Latn the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one.
eng_Latn the grief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility.
eng_Latn had contrived to ingratiate himself
eng_Latn I'm so sorry I let them run away Dog.
eng_Latn I started out
eng_Latn for any beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light to my reason and strength to my heart
eng_Latn scars of knife thrusts in the belly
eng_Latn got annoyed because they had sucked it and wet the filter with spit.
eng_Latn Hello. I am Dog and this is my friend, Pug. Can we be of any assistance?
eng_Latn I felt my body go rigid.
eng_Latn he had lain in his berth
eng_Latn but four vigorous arms seized him as his feet quitted the bottom of the boat
eng_Latn circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings.
eng_Latn the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon the table was blurred by it.
eng_Latn We knows a pirate song too!
eng_Latn the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and
eng_Latn I don't know what that means
eng_Latn I beseech you to let me bring him here.
eng_Latn give me a draft for 4,998 louis on these gentlemen
eng_Latn then turned away and paid no more attention to him or his costume.
eng_Latn , was a low ottoman near the marble chimney piece
eng_Latn Yessssss!
eng_Latn get away from the sphinx unharmed
eng_Latn It appears to be a very long and very steep cave.
eng_Latn yet keep watch on the light side.
eng_Latn that zigzagged through the house to the upper stories.
eng_Latn supposing he had lost control
eng_Latn Lit only by the flicker of an oil lamp or candle these were hard times for those who lived and worked in the days and nights before electricity.
eng_Latn it is better she should not see us together to night.
eng_Latn but with these gentlemen it's impossible to do anything,
eng_Latn as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound
eng_Latn though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with.
eng_Latn that they had not even time to search each other's heads for lice.
eng_Latn hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
eng_Latn I was rendered dumb in the middle of the first sentence, by a threat that I should be shown into a room by myself the very next syllable I uttered.
eng_Latn for a draught of the beverage prepared by the doctor
eng_Latn the laughter neither slowed me nor upset my focus.
eng_Latn a pleasant sittyated grog shop.
eng_Latn which he found a hard command.
eng_Latn I looked into my still full coffee cup.
eng_Latn whether knights errant deserve to be held in estimation,
eng_Latn I am a selfish girl!
eng_Latn had better mark it with ruddle, like the inscriptions on the walls of class rooms
eng_Latn had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy
eng_Latn I'll run get my drum.
eng_Latn I didn't expect it all to happen so fast!
eng_Latn sighing once or twice
eng_Latn as though it were in the bar room that he expected the changes to have occurred.
eng_Latn he could not detect any sign of interest or rejection
eng_Latn I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor.
eng_Latn for the first time one could tell just by looking at her that she was a mother.
eng_Latn I came to congratulate you on the inquest this afternoon.
eng_Latn I would much rather take a chair at any time.
eng_Latn Be-cause we have learnt that if you look after your dog your dog will always be your best friend.
eng_Latn there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary
eng_Latn so perfect that the best regulated clock could not surpass it.
eng_Latn placed his most valuable possessions in the strongbox
eng_Latn she went into his room to announce her determination.
eng_Latn afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste
eng_Latn I clumb in and paddled her ashore.
eng_Latn I love you as my life
eng_Latn we could not, without difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of his pocket.
eng_Latn to see how red my eyes were, and how sorrowful my face.
eng_Latn I was not fifteen when my father found that I had a lover,
eng_Latn now cover 'im up and let 'im get to his work.
eng_Latn an optical illusion which every one has experienced.
eng_Latn And we can draw on it for ideas.
eng_Latn not marry until he had trodden out a good clear path for himself away from the broad road which was quite ready made.
eng_Latn he would not have given a farthing to meet with another adventure.
eng_Latn who was apparently on his deathbed
eng_Latn I just had a dream.
eng_Latn she wasn't a teacher to cross.
eng_Latn I wish I could see those starsclose up.
eng_Latn but he placed himself directly in the way
eng_Latn which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it
eng_Latn or at least aprincess, to have a thing like that.
eng_Latn the fire which followed
eng_Latn he knew it only with his intellect
eng_Latn the soldiers of theEmpire setting out on a fresh campaign
eng_Latn a stockbroker with a position of respectability, a wife and two children.
eng_Latn she is such a grande dame, so kind, and evidently likes me so much.
eng_Latn the slightest trace of doubt in her tone.
eng_Latn a long, low line of mangrove trees along the horizon.
eng_Latn that what he really needed was the process of war more than the outcome of victory.
eng_Latn must be a comfort to him under any distress.
eng_Latn I love you.
eng_Latn was easily accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste
eng_Latn but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.
eng_Latn she knew them both directly.
eng_Latn for if it were not in accordance with his full will and pleasure
eng_Latn I am Dog and this is Pug, and we will be your friends.
eng_Latn a regular meeting.
eng_Latn dragged it up to the front of the dungeon to the empty table.
eng_Latn I recognized my cue.
eng_Latn he was even not incapable of taking an interest in the things of the mind.
eng_Latn even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.
eng_Latn literally hugged himself for joy.
eng_Latn He appears to be in some distress.
eng_Latn had lost his health ashore
eng_Latn for the danger was imminent.
eng_Latn I'm the oldest woman in these parts, I guess, and I still make m'own biscuit.
eng_Latn Why do you say that Pug?
eng_Latn there is a sun on the coin fire worshipper, depend upon it.
eng_Latn in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have been made
eng_Latn I do better than that sir I save you
eng_Latn I made my acknowledgements by prostrating myself at his majesty's feet.
eng_Latn the following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language she could command
eng_Latn each separate cause or whole series of causes appears
eng_Latn I haven't thought of other women since I met the merchant's daughter.
eng_Latn naturally made him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of courtship.
eng_Latn It's so true!
eng_Latn the first words he pronounced were
eng_Latn only fastening one of my legs with a chain, near my bed
eng_Latn And now we must return to the bookshop.
eng_Latn until there was no more of his scent caught in it.
eng_Latn that they had better be going home before it rained.
eng_Latn took a trembling peep.
eng_Latn took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other
eng_Latn Thank you Pug. You were very brave.
eng_Latn he is bound to say certain words between his teeth
eng_Latn for a mule trader who did not know how to read or write
eng_Latn I love THIS book.
eng_Latn I reckon it's a form of madness.
eng_Latn The only thing I really miss is a good old game of cricket.
eng_Latn this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right.
eng_Latn I cannot rest until I have won back my losses.
eng_Latn he had watched for him to come home so as to be sure of finding him in.
eng_Latn I saw his intent in time to brace myself.
eng_Latn please let me out, mister
eng_Latn I love telling that story.
eng_Latn I wish you wouldn't.
eng_Latn What treasure does Ann Thology say we have to find?
eng_Latn deep inside some fold or furrow
eng_Latn neither indeed was I much in their debt
eng_Latn but he'd be honest if it paid him to be honest.
eng_Latn I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son.
eng_Latn at the thought what absolution would mean to her if she believed in it only ever so little.
eng_Latn I must make the little parlour my sitting room, and keep her with me.
eng_Latn it seemed a gay little chime after the great bell.
eng_Latn they all conjectured that my misfortunes had impaired my reason.
eng_Latn a ghastly, all pervasive embarrassment.
eng_Latn my cavalier has attained his object
eng_Latn but he had not then known the full pressure of alternatives yet more disagreeable.
eng_Latn he felt a little nervous and embarrassed.
eng_Latn but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her.
eng_Latn pursued the fellow, surveying the range of closed doors.
eng_Latn I saw that the garden had obeyed the jungle law, even as the woods had done.
eng_Latn I couldn t decide what shape to make it. Or how to paint it. Or how many ribbons to use. What do you think, Dog?
eng_Latn a wobbly wheeled wagon swayed out of a side street and creaked up to them.
eng_Latn I had quarelled with him some time previously and had even challenged him to fight me but he refused
eng_Latn beaded round with gilt
eng_Latn but he simply turned his head the other way
eng_Latn other seamen having but a right of way through it.
eng_Latn against the fatal effects of the poison
eng_Latn I must try.
eng_Latn half of it at least by right belonged to you
eng_Latn My socks may have been taken by aliens.
eng_Latn who loves him and has sacrificed all her life to him.
eng_Latn your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man and that this is certain, CERTAIN!
eng_Latn I couldn't bring myself to admit I'd given up after only one session.
eng_Latn Playing panic playlist
eng_Latn climbed out, and started walking.
eng_Latn gave him a long enumeration of all the indispensable things that had been got on credit.
eng_Latn too proud to admit she wasnt able to walk properly.
eng_Latn I think it might be best if we gavethat to no one.
eng_Latn houses and buildings in the major cities.
eng_Latn drawn so tight that he could not move without their cutting into the flesh.
eng_Latn to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down.
eng_Latn I ask no more, so I remain a part of ye.
eng_Latn he said mournfully.
eng_Latn was about to turn back to his bed when something caught his eye.
eng_Latn folding his arms with such violence that his clenched
eng_Latn I'm not sure how we will save you.But saving you will definitely happen.
eng_Latn he had turned his friend into a badger.
eng_Latn offered him a sum of money and a safe conduct out of the country for the betrayal of his band.
eng_Latn wherein the two black boxes were never seen open or known to be left unlocked
eng_Latn that I would marry hereven if I couldn't love her any more as I once did.
eng_Latn I'm a big fan of yours.
eng_Latn he gave him a standard receipt for the money.
eng_Latn Are there any awfully big creatures on this island, Dog?
eng_Latn he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated.
eng_Latn That s an awfully big footprint.
eng_Latn make what discoveries I could.
eng_Latn But I can t go and get tools and wood and fings to mend it! In case someone tries to cross over while I'm gone!
eng_Latn he might have been safe at home with his family at this time, as well as myself.
eng_Latn she just figgered it was so purty
eng_Latn but he saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go.
eng_Latn I'd never met any vampires less civilized.
eng_Latn only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache
eng_Latn Granny Pug!
eng_Latn in that interval he fastened the two doors of the house against me
eng_Latn I'll be content to eat my own head, sir!
eng_Latn I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.
eng_Latn but more often he's in a robe with a cowl.
eng_Latn she hastened from the room.
eng_Latn the sweet smelling air stealing in at the low porch
eng_Latn The bookshop mice are going on holiday.
eng_Latn was to come one of these days and take her.
eng_Latn There may be better things to wear on your head when you want to tell people what to do Pug.
eng_Latn so I changed off and went that way.
eng_Latn Smugglers Beach! I were here too.
eng_Latn a cargador would fly out head first and hands abroad, to sprawl under the forelegs of the silver grey mare, who only pricked forward her sharp little ears.
eng_Latn vanished from view as he put on the cloak.
eng_Latn for as he has restored me to my original condition
eng_Latn ...I love books that....
eng_Latn as if she were moving under water.
eng_Latn let him approach and say whether it is really his majesty lying there.
eng_Latn which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act
eng_Latn Here is a red page two.
eng_Latn don't snivel before me.
eng_Latn should now investigate his parents andhis past?
eng_Latn just one big heavy blast from the past, a great big golden gasser.
eng_Latn but I must pray for the dead.
eng_Latn We re very sorry if we caused you any distress.
eng_Latn asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded.
eng_Latn on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter.
eng_Latn but I meant self command.
eng_Latn I don t think he will Dog.
eng_Latn presided, for determining the disputed rights and properties of men
eng_Latn but he must be worthy of her.
eng_Latn you should open your own account here.
eng_Latn how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him
eng_Latn kept me so busy
eng_Latn after dragging from her those things which were most precious to her and trampling on them
eng_Latn everybody in both families thought it would be better to get married soon.
eng_Latn I told you
eng_Latn not that I think he deserves it
eng_Latn no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety
eng_Latn so much so that it seems to have been written especially for you.
eng_Latn if hehad ever had any, had fallen into an abyss.
eng_Latn for instance there had been such cases.
eng_Latn but after the flu he seemed to change
eng_Latn they spoke of playing charades, but in my ignorance I did not understand the term.
eng_Latn I can make a granny who s fallenfast asleep.
eng_Latn not unartfully made
eng_Latn we've driven up to see you today because we found your name
eng_Latn a false step plunged us more than once thigh deep into the dark, quivering mire
eng_Latn passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers
eng_Latn I completely messed up
eng_Latn Mmmmmm! Jelly and cream...
eng_Latn stood in silent groups, waiting.
eng_Latn wiping his large knife on his apron
eng_Latn he with that broke off
eng_Latn was taller than any of the other three who attended him.
eng_Latn I must hurry you, so that
eng_Latn he suddenly issued from the shadow of the road side
eng_Latn I could probably find some friends who know him.
eng_Latn It's a kite of course!
eng_Latn you can fit into almost any society.
eng_Latn for, upon my admittance two days after my arrival
eng_Latn I'd never heard him be so impolite before.
eng_Latn By my granny. Granny Pug!
eng_Latn I beam at him and take another huge bite.
eng_Latn I told you you'd lose 'm, she cried out.
eng_Latn placing his pocketbook under his pillow.
eng_Latn you will see that what I have said is true.
eng_Latn she would rear and maintain me as one of her own children.
eng_Latn that was obvious
eng_Latn i am terrified lest my father should recognise him and come to know of our loves.
eng_Latn Tell me about it. I wanted to growup to be a unicorn. But I grew up to be a this.
eng_Latn I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon.
eng_Latn he had been the candle and not the some one.
eng_Latn now without the nose which had made him so hideous
eng_Latn this young woman is only her niece, and very proud.
eng_Latn remember the good old days, gentlemen.
eng_Latn took pity upon the poor orphan
eng_Latn being kept a close prisoner in my cabin
eng_Latn Puff?
eng_Latn a source of little visible delight, but necessary.
eng_Latn I needed was some food and a little rest.
eng_Latn I was a pup. Now I'm grown-up.
eng_Latn because he viewed it emotionally.
eng_Latn each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air
eng_Latn took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter
eng_Latn their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.
eng_Latn Don t worry, We ll be back before you can say .....
eng_Latn I need a small freighter with a clean record.
eng_Latn by presenting dreadful scenes to their view.
eng_Latn I'd leave her here forever if I could.
eng_Latn I have no long gun to reach ye.
eng_Latn we had the room to ourselves.
eng_Latn I must do something.
eng_Latn overflowed the city to that point.
eng_Latn by his art, so place and time himself on his way
eng_Latn but her daughters dissuaded her
eng_Latn live to be happy yourself
eng_Latn riding with a few peons across the coast range.
eng_Latn you have taken to working without pay.
eng_Latn I lifted my head and kissed him with a passion that might possibly set the forest on fire.
eng_Latn then you'll know that I'm wanting you to brace up
eng_Latn I wondered why we must go so soon.
eng_Latn she had never been fully conscious of the weight and size of the drama that she had provoked
eng_Latn now we have to prove the connection between the man and the beast.
eng_Latn I doubt it.
eng_Latn his father on his right, his grandfather on his left
eng_Latn a dark suit with a vest
eng_Latn I smoothed the whole thing over.
eng_Latn he took a scythe from a peasant and began mowing.
eng_Latn put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage
eng_Latn but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness
eng_Latn I couldn't succeed till everything she knew was out.
eng_Latn for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that
eng_Latn purposely torn in half
eng_Latn to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question.
eng_Latn there was no time to reflect upon or to controvert his statement
eng_Latn DORIS IS CLEVER!
eng_Latn with so little common sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder
eng_Latn went awry because of the jubilee.
eng_Latn sometimes a little intolerant of easy going things and people.
eng_Latn seeing him fail a little.
eng_Latn I found him, I took him home and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at home and did not show him to any one till to day.
eng_Latn when the above words were put to us by a stranger
eng_Latn one, who remains my most faithful servant, and who has already reentered my service.
eng_Latn he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected.
eng_Latn I am sure it will be better than our going from here.I feel certain of it.
eng_Latn on an inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins
eng_Latn we must put mustard poultices, as hot as they can be made, on his feet and legs.
eng_Latn screamed again, came down on his right leg once more
eng_Latn nearly a hundred thousand roubles!
eng_Latn the toy boats become indistinguishable from ocean liners.
eng_Latn ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes.
eng_Latn when the first single celled organisms appeared.
eng_Latn we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea.
eng_Latn but when she came and he realised that he had gone out of her thoughts entirely
eng_Latn there was another loud BANG
eng_Latn an embarrassed dog looks like.
eng_Latn left her by herself to follow as she had proposed.
eng_Latn she had become very serious
eng_Latn his arms locked around my waist and pulled me tight against his body.
eng_Latn though, to my sorrow, there was no grazing here
eng_Latn who paused an impressive moment
eng_Latn ended by each of us falling asleep in our chairs.
eng_Latn I was afraid it hit you.
eng_Latn only beauty with him took the place of truth.
eng_Latn just as my little nurse had instructed me.
eng_Latn by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised
eng_Latn get him to give me a little oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam
eng_Latn I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office.
eng_Latn while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten
eng_Latn as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart
eng_Latn I slipped up and peeped in at the window.
eng_Latn I only begged you to let me be of some good to you.
eng_Latn chuckled with delight at his pupil's proficiency.
eng_Latn I grew angry and he left me.
eng_Latn I saw him no more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.
eng_Latn then get in the car again
eng_Latn who will swear to everything thatis in that paper and more,
eng_Latn No need to panic Pug. I'm sure it's nothing.
eng_Latn in the pretext he gave for their rupture
eng_Latn who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves
eng_Latn he was horribly shaken
eng_Latn lingered on the matting, that she might leave her husband quite free.
eng_Latn impenetrable perseverance of men from the uplands.
eng_Latn but this little piece o scratch that's here.
eng_Latn how far off he must be already!
eng_Latn maybe, who knows, the upturned boat with hishat and her veil discovered!
eng_Latn I have answered your first appeal
eng_Latn so much blood gushed forth from him
eng_Latn I am Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn I do not even want you to speak to her again.
eng_Latn I saw you going up the creek there with him a while ago.
eng_Latn I will throw up everything and fly to you
eng_Latn that he had been approached by a young working man in the factory, newly married, who
eng_Latn I kissed the back of it
eng_Latn all for a naughty orphan which nobody can't love.
eng_Latn striving to struggle against this triple force and his own emotion
eng_Latn rose at his usual easy hour the next morning
eng_Latn must be absent on the very day.
eng_Latn allowed him to proceed, and he continued
eng_Latn I cannot accept it without my father' s permission.
eng_Latn achieving them again in gossip.
eng_Latn I keep my eyes fixed on the beige carpet.
eng_Latn but finding the cub was safe for away it ran
eng_Latn but she had no time at all for it.
eng_Latn nothing to bother about in the army except getting killed.
eng_Latn I paced it against my own heartbeat, but I wasn't sure if that was any measure.
eng_Latn I was pretty confident it was no accident.
eng_Latn but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!
eng_Latn wizards should have a thorough understanding of the non magical community
eng_Latn when he met me, he knew I was no dog.
eng_Latn you could never see it.
eng_Latn he holding his hat in one hand, and his stick in the other
eng_Latn I stare out of the window
eng_Latn the work of a prankster
eng_Latn pull out a few of their hairs
eng_Latn it all happened very suddenly, as you say.
eng_Latn the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off the wall.
eng_Latn the grief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility.
eng_Latn now you must try to be useful.
eng_Latn Big enough for all the animals wholived there to play together very happily indeed.
eng_Latn I asked, darkness seeping into my voice.
eng_Latn tomorrow morning, sister, you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it.
eng_Latn then I called him a beggar.
eng_Latn The Kangaroos and the Koala.
eng_Latn but in fact no animal had ever actually retired.
eng_Latn we came to a long kind of building, made of timber stuck in the ground
eng_Latn if he could console her for my loss.
eng_Latn but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight.
eng_Latn she did not think it was decent to accept without the consent of her fiance .
eng_Latn then he sat down again.
eng_Latn there were even a few girls in her classes who were reasonably nice.
eng_Latn with him, one of our own sort
eng_Latn but I think you may have some secret sorrow.
eng_Latn I told her that when I'd had enough of her she'd have to go
eng_Latn I like to pay my debts
eng_Latn I will pick you up at eight fifteen.
eng_Latn I won't cause her pain now.
eng_Latn a doublebarreled shotgun clutched in both hands.
eng_Latn Who are you talking to you lilylivered land-lubber?
eng_Latn or even alone in a boat with a biscuit.
eng_Latn I pretended to be a nurse and I drew his blood.
eng_Latn now it had not long cleared up.
eng_Latn I'm just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.
eng_Latn softly raising up his right fore foot to remove my hand.
eng_Latn I smiled at how perfectly blase I sounded.
eng_Latn sipped the whisky delicately
eng_Latn I'm not a magician or a mage.
eng_Latn care was taken to have it made so clean, that the dust was not offensive.
eng_Latn but another stroke would settle him.
eng_Latn took his gun in one hand his pickaxe in the other
eng_Latn Umm Armadillos... Artichokes...Ah.Artists!
eng_Latn leave the door open for you.
eng_Latn it might spoil many a match.
eng_Latn I was struck with the singular posture he maintained.
eng_Latn among the things he said to him was that which will be told in the following chapter.
eng_Latn I was always of the party
eng_Latn but it was unintelligible.
eng_Latn rewards given to the benefactors of man than to his destroyers
eng_Latn but my knife tumbled over my fork, my fork tripped up my knife
eng_Latn he searched, hastily fluttering the pages, and said
eng_Latn as he takes his leave of the pair
eng_Latn with the illusion of feeling that he was part of a family.
eng_Latn No. That is definitely something. Proceed to panic.
eng_Latn he was himself as one dead.
eng_Latn just mull things over in the hot water.
eng_Latn until he passed a group of them next to the bakers.
eng_Latn her having one uncle who was a country attorney,
eng_Latn she came close again, clinging to him.
eng_Latn drawing him out entirely they perceived he had his eyes shut and every appearance of being fast asleep.
eng_Latn but I can see, she's just as freaked out as me.
eng_Latn I endeavoured to stop her thoughtless tongue.
eng_Latn Bye.
eng_Latn a thousand good quips and cranks would be lost to him.
eng_Latn with none of the rather wandering attention span typical of a four year old.
eng_Latn an event that has not been held for over a century.
eng_Latn And this glove... belongs with this glove!
eng_Latn I wondered if she would guess immediately who I was as well.
eng_Latn they wouldn't hunt nobody down
eng_Latn it was not their way to suppose any evil could be told.
eng_Latn getting a bit of good contriving and solid building done
eng_Latn though there was no trace of that in her voice.
eng_Latn for it is not everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.
eng_Latn They are words - in pictures!
eng_Latn cat like, with bare feet
eng_Latn after the double catastrophe
eng_Latn had a good cry.
eng_Latn therefore I shall confess and await forgiveness.
eng_Latn they have all sorts of ceremonies and artifices of their own
eng_Latn for if they have not been of the body they have been of the spirit
eng_Latn you were so good that I can't help coming to you again.
eng_Latn remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.
eng_Latn I had the intelligence from her father yesterday.
eng_Latn may not be said and heard again to morrow.
eng_Latn it will bring bad luck.
eng_Latn then plumped down in a chair by the table.
eng_Latn I had only just come home
eng_Latn gazed round them in the clear morning light.
eng_Latn So lots and lots of happy people could come in and buy his books!
eng_Latn directed the guard to open the barrier.
eng_Latn I come direct.
eng_Latn I turned him out of my house this morning.
eng_Latn I will shout in the fruit seller's ear, that she is aniece of mine
eng_Latn I selected someone very attractive
eng_Latn it had been decided that the marriage should take place within six weeks.
eng_Latn opening the door of a room
eng_Latn Remember not to look down, Dog.
eng_Latn but she never looked up, and the lesson was not spoiled for her.
eng_Latn waking her from her previous stupidity and incurious self absorbed ignorance about her husband's relation to others.
eng_Latn that might embarrass me
eng_Latn when he had had his tea he went to bed.
eng_Latn which had her at its beck and call
eng_Latn that he had been overwhelmed by the burden of disillusion.
eng_Latn before me they were nothing after me they will be nothing
eng_Latn whatever might have been the general's crimes, he had certainly too much wit to let them sue for detection.
eng_Latn I'm not sure we'll want you then.
eng_Latn I hoped the voyage had been good
eng_Latn in order to make sure that they would bury him dead.
eng_Latn for this piece of absent mindedness she underwent acoulpe which lasted during the whole service
eng_Latn for he was timid and fond of the approbation of his friends.
eng_Latn she misunderstood him and opened the door a bit wider to let us in.
eng_Latn it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that.
eng_Latn the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke
eng_Latn fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty eight of them.
eng_Latn I tell you she wasn't cold, when I stole it!
eng_Latn Will you be my friends too?
eng_Latn I dial it again.
eng_Latn I can do it. I WILL do it. See whatI can do!
eng_Latn I read the note
eng_Latn I'll do anything.
eng_Latn there is only one real sentiment comradeship between man and man.
eng_Latn I'll bring the father backwith me, too, to identify the body.
eng_Latn only give orders to put out both your eyes.
eng_Latn I am so glad poor father did get that house.
eng_Latn I doubt there is any way to get a needle through the amniotic sac
eng_Latn which were qualities altogether opposite to those animals.
eng_Latn I've explained why I said that.
eng_Latn I asked the headmaster if the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice.
eng_Latn a game which could boast of a more aristocratic public, and was played with cards instead of with a wheel.
eng_Latn here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.
eng_Latn A pet dragon.
eng_Latn I refused staunchly.
eng_Latn that she whom we loved in life shall enjoy her just and eternal reward.
eng_Latn he watched the appearance of nature again
eng_Latn I unfortunately left behind me for haste
eng_Latn I was so sensitively aware, indeed, of being younger than I could have wished
eng_Latn but because she will marry
eng_Latn not of what other people may lose.
eng_Latn it was like she wasn't even human!
eng_Latn the feast'll be starting in five minutes.
eng_Latn for I am getting rusty here.
eng_Latn like I'd been crying or something.
eng_Latn he would not have to watch his hair turn gray.
eng_Latn of her own accord she had allowed me to tell her as much .
eng_Latn I had decided that I was willing to marry her.
eng_Latn Whatever is the matter Pug?
eng_Latn I I hope so, sir.
eng_Latn preceded by two barefoot orderlies
eng_Latn which, being creosoted, burned well.
eng_Latn he was now filled with amazement at what he heard from the goatherd
eng_Latn a vague gesture to some past century but whether seventeenth, eighteenth, or nineteenth.
eng_Latn And now I hath learnt of mighty monsters who dwell upon a hill and that I must drive away!
eng_Latn I leaned against the wall by the door, waiting.
eng_Latn she'd been gone this long before.
eng_Latn Oh Be careful.
eng_Latn looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself.
eng_Latn so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained.
eng_Latn while you're at it
eng_Latn she had not given a thought to the fact that the price she was paying for the safety of home was permanent exile from it.
eng_Latn a thick set, freckled cossack.
eng_Latn I've had a hellish time.
eng_Latn strong when you are sickly
eng_Latn I was raised to abide by traffic laws.
eng_Latn slipped out into the entrance hall.
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all..
eng_Latn the snake vanished in a small puff of black smoke.
eng_Latn behind which theguard was massed on a slope of the plain.
eng_Latn so close that we had to strike sail to avoid running foul of her
eng_Latn leaned close to it, and muttered the password
eng_Latn was used to being beaten from time to time.
eng_Latn with a little boy before hiM
eng_Latn that might embarrass me
eng_Latn I honor my pack. I do what's best for them.
eng_Latn he shook his head in submission.
eng_Latn those mustering none but young vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
eng_Latn he was convicted and a new trial refused then,well then
eng_Latn the father asked anxiously.
eng_Latn the other two stood one on each side to support him.
eng_Latn for I had no fear of retirement.
eng_Latn in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery
eng_Latn she moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I couldn't sleep.
eng_Latn though be strove to imagine what desire
eng_Latn And a magical wand! Double wow-zer!
eng_Latn so now you know.
eng_Latn a long night during which she lay awake until dawn, her ears strained to hear his key in the latch.
eng_Latn then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall.
eng_Latn he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency.
eng_Latn I made that remark to him afterwards when we met after some sort of order had been restored in the town
eng_Latn their only contact with it was through the magic written word.
eng_Latn I laughed so hard I snorted.
eng_Latn who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.
eng_Latn I put the firstquestion that I came across.
eng_Latn he had taken with him when he left
eng_Latn hardly was his head laid back on the pillow than he went to sleep.
eng_Latn the poor little boat almost sank in the bronze coloured waves.
eng_Latn for I begin to suffer again.
eng_Latn as to conceive the idea of improving on his method
eng_Latn but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut
eng_Latn I was glad for the poor fellow, and went home.
eng_Latn I examined the food in his lap.
eng_Latn he bent his head, groped with his mouth for hers, found it.
eng_Latn but he immediately turns back and stares out of the window again.
eng_Latn I felt like there was something right over by the turnpike embankment, and that it was watching me.
eng_Latn who nodded encouragingly
eng_Latn yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him
eng_Latn but I am only an old hobbit, and I miss my meal at noon.
eng_Latn provided she conceived between eleven and twelve either of the day or night
eng_Latn I mean to get something to do directly, and earn money.
eng_Latn but all in a somewhat decayed condition
eng_Latn so, making a show of severe suffering
eng_Latn call out the militia.
eng_Latn that he was ready for any trial
eng_Latn I hope you may be able to think so well of me
eng_Latn Of course! I am Merlin - magicianto good King Arthur.
eng_Latn left behind by the advance of civilisation
eng_Latn I bet it is.
eng_Latn he stared helplessly.
eng_Latn that he had not even presence of mind enough
eng_Latn he dropped, all dressed as he was, upon the bed, where he immediately fell into a profound sleep.
eng_Latn but she got out of the car and bolted for the front door.
eng_Latn I was told to put it in the post.
eng_Latn as one who dreads pursuit.
eng_Latn to support the teachers during this troubled time.
eng_Latn like all men, he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love
eng_Latn Pug, your nose is amazing!
eng_Latn of the suppressed fire of vitality, and the consciousness of her own attractiveness.
eng_Latn also a kind of sticky pink stuff in an oval matchwood box with a tiny tin spoon to eat it with, which cost a halfpenny.
eng_Latn Oh..My head is going round and round!
eng_Latn It's Father! He s on his way back!
eng_Latn though not necessarily conciliated.
eng_Latn These are the Puggle-Wuggles, whohelp me run my factory.
eng_Latn then I fell a vomiting, which gave me great relief.
eng_Latn Hmm How curious. Do you think that really sounds like a monster Pug?
eng_Latn suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle.
eng_Latn but as he neither looked up nor spoke, she finally made a movement to the door
eng_Latn we shall be married all our lives after.
eng_Latn he was in no danger and would be out soon.
eng_Latn nor was the heart of any dog.
eng_Latn I stepped forward again, and he stepped back.
eng_Latn sleeping in one bed
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer!
eng_Latn so we took a gray view of the place.
eng_Latn hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside.
eng_Latn to yet another the stifling of the future to the peril of liberty.
eng_Latn but they kept on watching the room.
eng_Latn his laughing face towards me, and submitted his head to her inspection
eng_Latn What s a navigator?
eng_Latn it is my philosophy that in order to be successful
eng_Latn but so nervous that he almost stuttered.
eng_Latn offered him a sum of money and a safe conduct out of the country for the betrayal of his band.
eng_Latn had marked it with the tri colour, and were drinking brandy in its state apartments.
eng_Latn no aid had been given in change of place
eng_Latn Hoo hoo hoo!
eng_Latn I am wrong!
eng_Latn there was nothing I could say to clear myself.
eng_Latn silently continued to walk to and fro.
eng_Latn which will start on my whistle.
eng_Latn To show how handsome he is.
eng_Latn she asked, her voice rough with stress and fear.
eng_Latn We have ballet and opera and a book group.
eng_Latn with an imposing calmness, but I think it is now
eng_Latn I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracts of human feet, and some of cows
eng_Latn where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here.
eng_Latn when you step out to face that creature
eng_Latn with difficulty remembering where he was, and where he ought to walk or drive.
eng_Latn but his moral machinery was still out of gear.
eng_Latn but they wanted me to carry on with my braces.
eng_Latn I found myself suddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring
eng_Latn as the spider balled itself up and began to roll over and over.
eng_Latn but said nothing.
eng_Latn because I thought it might be one of those men up ahead instead of you.
eng_Latn but I will no
eng_Latn but that enemy is only the agent of providence
eng_Latn all too human creatures.
eng_Latn which seemed to magnify her own
eng_Latn staving her in completely, but without doing any further damage.
eng_Latn about 1925 in fact it even crossed my mind that I might have done so.
eng_Latn which protected my breast!
eng_Latn No it doesn t. But it does say that we met Granny Pug here.
eng_Latn it's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.
eng_Latn he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired.
eng_Latn that in his poor opinion, the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least water rat
eng_Latn to recognize the enemy.
eng_Latn I got to have it to night.
eng_Latn Bet you can t see me now Dog.
eng_Latn acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis judging in all her ideas on one subject
eng_Latn that the captain was much gratified by their good will.
eng_Latn I was a beast and cruel to him.
eng_Latn he was the investigating lawyer, from the school of jurisprudence, who had only lately come to the town.
eng_Latn Pug, will you join me in a bookthat makes your heart beat faster and your fur stand on end?
eng_Latn made the menfolk still seated at the breakfast table turn their heads curiously.
eng_Latn remembered how she asked him if he was proposing to her
eng_Latn then it won't matter what time you come for it.
eng_Latn Woo hoo.
eng_Latn for all, all except man, is sinless
eng_Latn One. Two. Three. Four...
eng_Latn I spent about twenty dollars on the trip, I think.
eng_Latn as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.
eng_Latn if she comes out, as I know she will, victorious from this struggle
eng_Latn Wow-Bowzer! Puzzle completed.
eng_Latn you're like the weather cock on a roof.
eng_Latn standing before him in his underclothes only.
eng_Latn for he seems in a mood to bewail himself for a month at a stretch.
eng_Latn she did better still in throwing up that crazy brother in law of yours.
eng_Latn I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world
eng_Latn well, it was him put her up to narking me.
eng_Latn but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father.
eng_Latn who have no remorse to disturb you.
eng_Latn Dog does like asking questions. AndPug?... Pug Loves Books.
eng_Latn the harpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
eng_Latn for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that
eng_Latn she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.
eng_Latn should you meet a doctor you will do me a favor by sending him to me.
eng_Latn Maybe I ll just eat them instead Dog but at record breaking speed!
eng_Latn I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's so kind of strange and unregular.
eng_Latn he had shrunk with proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject.
eng_Latn as though he doubted it.
eng_Latn but that he had a positive dislike for her.
eng_Latn I shan't see you in the restaurant this evening as I'm dining out.
eng_Latn he was unwilling to leave it untranslated
eng_Latn growing decidedly nervous so much so that his hand trembled slightly.
eng_Latn for, going as soon as I was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour
eng_Latn perhaps she had no temptation to transgress.
eng_Latn his inspection finished, he placed the key in the lock.
eng_Latn but I've got a good place.
eng_Latn I didn't ask her to do that.
eng_Latn had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes.
eng_Latn so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.
eng_Latn now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient.
eng_Latn she tells you about it.
eng_Latn as if he were a blind beggar on the street
eng_Latn I had never heard her more malicious about our common friends.
eng_Latn for that happiness would compose his mind and give him courage to make his confession.
eng_Latn their respective dreams without injury to each other.
eng_Latn he was watching, now, as it fluttered across the room
eng_Latn the golden egg, still damp from the bath, slipped from under his arm.
eng_Latn in whose protection as many more swords were in an instant unsheathed
eng_Latn nor notice my presence in the slightest way.
eng_Latn Dog dried his fur.
eng_Latn IT was about half past one three bells in the sea phrase that
eng_Latn meet with any of the natives
eng_Latn I was not going to be nervous and shy with the servants any more.
eng_Latn felt at the foreshadowing of success an almost boundless affection for his two helpers, for these two young people from over the sea.
eng_Latn looked as though he might cry.
eng_Latn that her fate must be decided now or never.
eng_Latn he even began to avoid being crushed
eng_Latn she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts.
eng_Latn I knew you were in the war.
eng_Latn Just some bunnies in the forest.
eng_Latn it seemed to himthat what he had just said was really true.
eng_Latn but he's one of our side
eng_Latn I think I know what happened with that money
eng_Latn we should attack their line of communication.
eng_Latn like the mist had done.
eng_Latn she put back into the box and carried away.
eng_Latn I passed the barber's shop.
eng_Latn there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear.
eng_Latn having lost only three men by sickness in the voyage
eng_Latn hadn't bothered to keep a close enough watch on him
eng_Latn mechanically sought for a book to place under his arm
eng_Latn for the honor she was doing himself and his sons
eng_Latn one large, fat beetle.
eng_Latn brilliant in a scarlet cloak over a frock of thinnest creamy silk.
eng_Latn perhaps, on perceiving it was still alive
eng_Latn how this affair stood between the two men.
eng_Latn brought him crashing to the floor.
eng_Latn when they saw him appear in the door
eng_Latn I don't want to talk about it.
eng_Latn he said to the waitress.
eng_Latn this young woman is only her niece, and very proud.
eng_Latn I've had my fling, and I don't mind settling down now.
eng_Latn waited there until two gentlemen came out
eng_Latn also it was nearly as cold as outdoors.
eng_Latn I shall beg his pardon, that's all.
eng_Latn pulled the lid fully open and tipped the newt in.
eng_Latn a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the world cannot add a seventh.
eng_Latn had he had no other clothes to wear than the skin of a bear not yet killed.
eng_Latn grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.
eng_Latn pull you down with him.
eng_Latn a dark heart, a spirit lacking inner light.
eng_Latn I wasn't back from the war.
eng_Latn I found my mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me.
eng_Latn she walked off across the backyard toward the flapping halffull clotheslines.
eng_Latn till we start south.
eng_Latn quite a first rate favourite with me already
eng_Latn had the insight to decline his hollow caresses.
eng_Latn you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.
eng_Latn I love men genuinely
eng_Latn gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless
eng_Latn what the laughter was about, drowned all the rest with his heavy roar.
eng_Latn it is not exciting on my island
eng_Latn having now the leisure to look around, let her eyes roam in delight.
eng_Latn making a clutch at me
eng_Latn but he respected the law and its need to be upheld.
eng_Latn we were off to another part of the line.
eng_Latn but swung his right foot, which hung down, and stared at the brazier with an air of savage revery.
eng_Latn I began speaking of you, she begged me not to.
eng_Latn I had indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers
eng_Latn I'll kick you!
eng_Latn was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
eng_Latn a flood of emotions surged up in him
eng_Latn but she thrashed again
eng_Latn by this time was beginning to come on oppressively.
eng_Latn I'm glad I had a chance to say good bye.
eng_Latn looked on, for a minute or so, in silence.
eng_Latn he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly
eng_Latn meeting with any interruption by the way.
eng_Latn but he could see that it was too late to try to escape.
eng_Latn she expressed with the thought that they seemed to have a very good time.
eng_Latn hundreds of homes resounding with their footsteps.
eng_Latn when I left her, I sought the garden.
eng_Latn as a sensible physiologist, simply particularly re mark its front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.
eng_Latn was steadying herself with a little bejewelled hand against the side of the door.
eng_Latn stayed with her until his death.
eng_Latn Really? Gosh! Perhaps I will.
eng_Latn a chance current had sent it alighting on her.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shop that will give you some more ideas?
eng_Latn that gave me a chance to truly compose and resolve myself.
eng_Latn immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of
eng_Latn I was glad to get her away from the house.
eng_Latn you was the first that found me!
eng_Latn she said, trying once again
eng_Latn he, raising his head, sprang nimbly to his feet
eng_Latn took the side of the workers.
eng_Latn no longer keep her whole attention.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients.
eng_Latn for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and eloquence of the curate
eng_Latn when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand
eng_Latn the women, dressing hastily, knocked on their neighbors' doors and spread the story.
eng_Latn come and see.
eng_Latn I'll have to look elsewhere for allies.
eng_Latn that they would attract more people, and get more credit,
eng_Latn she'd have thought it vaguely wicked sort of decadent and foreign and aristocratic to keep later hours.
eng_Latn but swallowed the home thrust in silence.
eng_Latn I'm going to insist that he replace her.
eng_Latn I was perfectly well.
eng_Latn suddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably
eng_Latn is drinking a glass of water and looks startled to see me.
eng_Latn applied his eye to the keyhole, which wastolerably large
eng_Latn took us for ghosts or devils
eng_Latn including the name and address of a first class mercenary.
eng_Latn the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.
eng_Latn I stared him down.
eng_Latn I jumped the ditch and scrambled up into the trees
eng_Latn rushing out of the church.
eng_Latn I felt sick at myself, sick and disgusted.
eng_Latn I'm running a fever.
eng_Latn the two ladies squeezed in as well as they could.
eng_Latn stairs which before this he had seen from the jail!
eng_Latn we might go for a canter sometime.
eng_Latn what a good servant should tell his master.
eng_Latn I thought you'd be all right together.
eng_Latn yet after a few minutes the bird came back.
eng_Latn Thank-you Pug, but why so many candles?
eng_Latn that accomplished, he had no further immediate fears.
eng_Latn driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who
eng_Latn I heard afterwards, however
eng_Latn they shook hands again.
eng_Latn but that with the same shrewdness and a little more luck
eng_Latn who the devil should know
eng_Latn I bet they didn't!
eng_Latn I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.
eng_Latn lotions made with the subacetate of lead, and fomentations of oxycrat.
eng_Latn I recalled her to my level.
eng_Latn for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.
eng_Latn the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute
eng_Latn I should like to have some further proof of it.
eng_Latn said her father was gone for the chaise, and he must make haste and get himself ready.
eng_Latn bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.
eng_Latn I begged he would forbear applying that word to me
eng_Latn I saw my reflection glimmer in his agonized eyes as the sun touched my own skin.
eng_Latn the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me.
eng_Latn I am going to see now if can get good advice about it.
eng_Latn looking up at the wheeling stars in the vast sky.
eng_Latn put him to driving a lumber wagon
eng_Latn for a man he was to her
eng_Latn I could show you in a few minutes after dinner if you wanted to.
eng_Latn there was not a square inch of his body that was not tattooed, front and back, and from his neck to his toes.
eng_Latn I turned round when I heard the soft closing of the door.
eng_Latn permit me to marry her!
eng_Latn soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner.
eng_Latn I have loved my misery.
eng_Latn then it's not for any darky to talk impudent about him.
eng_Latn I am not likely to fall into mistakes from excess of optimism.
eng_Latn and inscribed his name to speak against the budget
eng_Latn literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.
eng_Latn but it's incredible yeh don't know his name
eng_Latn one apparently contained the two bazookas
eng_Latn used some other speeches I had been taught.
eng_Latn where there is most dirt and smell and all sorts of nastiness.
eng_Latn happy in the sense that he had got nearer to the attainment of his aims that evening than during the last two months.
eng_Latn A real Knight!
eng_Latn I am unhappy enough as it is!
eng_Latn who smiled and swallowed the rest.
eng_Latn the very summit of glory was reached.
eng_Latn but he simply turned his head the other way
eng_Latn in the hope of out distancing the fatal news
eng_Latn If I think something is scary then I'm being brave when I do it!
eng_Latn How extraordinary!
eng_Latn with these words he once more embraced her
eng_Latn I thought that over for a minute while he waited.
eng_Latn It’s those naughty bookshop mice Pug. They will keep running around.
eng_Latn here the exact amount could be indicated in brackets
eng_Latn I wish your heart were independent.
eng_Latn it seems as if there were so many things which are more wanted in the world than pictures.
eng_Latn a wordless plea
eng_Latn they have to carry that attitude out into the street with them.
eng_Latn how she would order her life now, after that.
eng_Latn but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed.
eng_Latn because there had been neither time nor money to bring them out.
eng_Latn land mines and only the mis kept them safe.
eng_Latn a man was looking at a digital map on a computer.
eng_Latn A highly secretive and rare seamonster Pug. It's extremely shy.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shop that might help you perform more magical magic tricks?
eng_Latn they had invited the counting house clerk over, had divided the crop in his presence, and had raked together eleven stacks as the owner's share.
eng_Latn I remembered him forcing himself out of wolf form for me.
eng_Latn No... your majesty!
eng_Latn the last month's payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude
eng_Latn rsula visited him in his bedroom.
eng_Latn restored the sunshine to his face.
eng_Latn I am in no fear of you.
eng_Latn I tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk.
eng_Latn I had no one to write to.
eng_Latn I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it.
eng_Latn I am going to make you a captain of cavalry directly we get within sight of a horse again.
eng_Latn he looked at me astonished.
eng_Latn that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a time
eng_Latn it must be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman
eng_Latn where she had kept a notions shop ever since she was a young woman
eng_Latn she is not likely to go visiting on such a day.
eng_Latn an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness.
eng_Latn that's the way a woman most always does, but a man always does t'other way.
eng_Latn Woo. Hello. I am Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn but his uncle's kind remembrance delighted him
eng_Latn but for a pretty young woman like you it's early days for that house of charity.
eng_Latn therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose.
eng_Latn is that he was on the road all day,
eng_Latn deeply, softly, like a mellow organ, but with a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper's, which rasped his spine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound which, concussing, broke.
eng_Latn but there is another over me.
eng_Latn they had started jabbering and rocketing around
eng_Latn he felt an awkwardness at finishing it.
eng_Latn where a ferryman was waiting to take him across the moat.
eng_Latn Unless... we find our head torches!
eng_Latn I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if he were a real horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved.
eng_Latn This is a book all about catching things. And it is called...
eng_Latn turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.
eng_Latn because you know better than anyone.
eng_Latn it was as wet as everything else in the bathroom.
eng_Latn you are liable to be contradicted.
eng_Latn the roof was slippery.
eng_Latn get laughed at.
eng_Latn knew him again directly, and he seemed to have got some very pretty cattle too.
eng_Latn to this tale of wounded self love and defeated ambition
eng_Latn , but to restore your fortune to your granddaughter
eng_Latn with the terrible excitement of the evening
eng_Latn maybe that's why I'm here for terms.
eng_Latn upstairs almost all the rooms were finished.
eng_Latn not to be behind the rest
eng_Latn Pyramus and Thisbee
eng_Latn placing his pocketbook under his pillow.
eng_Latn the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river
eng_Latn I think it is only then that you are yourself.
eng_Latn I shall tell him all about you!
eng_Latn as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
eng_Latn leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him
eng_Latn Tent pegs
eng_Latn who thereand then proceeded to copy it.
eng_Latn if you're hard up
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book! And what s more, now I know how to get the mice out of my cake tin!
eng_Latn so hard that he missed the throat.
eng_Latn if you had one.
eng_Latn with his handkerchief rubbed his trouser knees,green with juicy grass.
eng_Latn swathed in a long black traveling cloak
eng_Latn as what appeared to be a small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head.
eng_Latn especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes
eng_Latn the four that were on horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted
eng_Latn I was so squeezed that I could hardly bear it.
eng_Latn as I reckoned, about nine hours.
eng_Latn the hill bare and dark
eng_Latn but he must be worthy of her.
eng_Latn some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground.
eng_Latn as they weren't entirely sure they were supposed to be out.
eng_Latn that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon.
eng_Latn was enough to make it all come rushing mightily up before his gaze.
eng_Latn because we've got to win today
eng_Latn gave it a minute's head start
eng_Latn no one else was looking.
eng_Latn Hello folks. In the end , I win this race.
eng_Latn to face the exit.
eng_Latn I came to see a man here.
eng_Latn in thee to desire to take that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer
eng_Latn we've got lots ter do tomorrow,
eng_Latn but perhaps not even a sage would be gratified that nobody missed him.
eng_Latn I do not wear a silly hat.
eng_Latn I gestured for her to follow me.
eng_Latn cold as marble and proud like his father
eng_Latn Bunnies in the forest
eng_Latn silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready
eng_Latn I sure will be glad to get out there.
eng_Latn I was a kinder friend than you deserved.
eng_Latn WHAT WE TEACH YOUHow to address your lodge.
eng_Latn This is a book about a very specialsomewhere and it is called...
eng_Latn playing the piano and writing things which sounded beautiful
eng_Latn the water was a flat calm.
eng_Latn for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship
eng_Latn attended on each side by persons of prime quality.
eng_Latn the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar.
eng_Latn the gates had been closed by order of the police, on account of the insurrection.
eng_Latn adieu, my friend adieu, my father!
eng_Latn then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, someone spoke.
eng_Latn in order to cover up the scandal.
eng_Latn claimed that all his property descended to them.
eng_Latn I had a longing to go upstairs and put on my dress
eng_Latn as soon as I dared, caught it up
eng_Latn then borne forward with prodigious speed.
eng_Latn drove off upon my new quest.
eng_Latn I am a clown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.
eng_Latn I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible.
eng_Latn but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.
eng_Latn I didn't know if you'd be able to keep it from her, promise or not.
eng_Latn I just slumped deeper into the chair, getting comfortable.
eng_Latn Don t worry, Pug. We re safe under here.
eng_Latn the decision whereof should be left entirely to their own breast.
eng_Latn I know the truth better than you do.
eng_Latn there was a monk he received and had a long talk with.
eng_Latn unless the wife takes care to provide a healthy father, among her neighbours or domestics
eng_Latn nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman's hand
eng_Latn arriving by flying car.
eng_Latn pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.
eng_Latn whose improvement was now our main effort.
eng_Latn he found himself lost in solitude.
eng_Latn instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army.
eng_Latn I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,
eng_Latn I made an awful mistake the first day.
eng_Latn r, which is that he should disapprove of what I have done
eng_Latn all of whom, high or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages
eng_Latn I coulda chucked my job
eng_Latn I never did see such a girl as you.
eng_Latn he looked up with the eyes of a tortured animal.
eng_Latn I know so.
eng_Latn for she insisted on being seen with him.
eng_Latn we're as close as we could be.
eng_Latn I shook my head, rising slowly to my feet.
eng_Latn I'm afraid not. I am Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn There is only one way to find out Pug. (calls out) Bookshop mi-ce!
eng_Latn in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.
eng_Latn I angrily turned round in bed
eng_Latn while we went up to the dining room
eng_Latn her habit of speaking with perfect genuineness asserting itself through all her uncertainty and agitation.
eng_Latn I had something else to do.
eng_Latn then fell to biting and tearing the rest
eng_Latn threw it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet
eng_Latn suddenly changing his tone
eng_Latn we can succeed in disciplining anyone.
eng_Latn So, places everyone.
eng_Latn it had all come upon me so suddenly.
eng_Latn I should like cabbage soup and porridge better than anything
eng_Latn that I still waited for him, and that still he did not come out, and lay down again.
eng_Latn as if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart
eng_Latn until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.
eng_Latn for the rich among them are for the most part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our carelessness and indifference.
eng_Latn knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post where he is stationed
eng_Latn that there might be no mistake in the person
eng_Latn the words trembled on her lips.
eng_Latn holding his breath
eng_Latn the fathers will hear of it and they too will begin to come.
eng_Latn or I'll be having another kind of talk with you.
eng_Latn but she walked on as rapidly as she could.
eng_Latn I'm very grateful for your help Dogand Pug. Is there anything magical I can do for you in return?
eng_Latn because I was under water to my neck.
eng_Latn because he hadn't any aunt.
eng_Latn perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughter loves a father
eng_Latn Pug, why are you using your metal detector in the shop again?
eng_Latn asked him into the room that had been assigned him.
eng_Latn I shattered a window in the back door with a brick
eng_Latn he again seized his trumpet
eng_Latn I had nothing to do with that.
eng_Latn I'll explain inside
eng_Latn at the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke
eng_Latn in relation to which document he had a notion that time was beginning to press now, and that it really must be got out of hand.
eng_Latn a long, low ceilinged room, dusty and spattered with cobwebs.
eng_Latn now, he gave vent to several very grim laughs
eng_Latn QUICK in here boys.
eng_Latn amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp
eng_Latn I never went near it.
eng_Latn I recalled his singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began to fear his wits were touched.
eng_Latn for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.
eng_Latn like flashing a shiny object at a child.
eng_Latn but really quite surprized.
eng_Latn for the time neither quarrelling nor crying
eng_Latn I can never see his face, but I can see his eyes.
eng_Latn that had cost many a carefree drunk his life.
eng_Latn I couldn't live in it for a moment.
eng_Latn with damaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.
eng_Latn they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.
eng_Latn you are aware from whom I come at least so my cashier tells me
eng_Latn forgive me, and that will do.
eng_Latn I decided that I must escape at once, if ever.
eng_Latn a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat.
eng_Latn I got tired of trying to stay away from you.
eng_Latn as it turned, in its aversion, elsewhere.
eng_Latn I looked automatically toward the unintentional call, realizing as my eyes found their destination that I recognized the voice I'd been listening to it so much today.
eng_Latn I'll take it off at once.
eng_Latn I swung round, looking at the gallery behind me.
eng_Latn one must project an image of success at all times
eng_Latn a frightfully grand woman!
eng_Latn taking the fowl from the young bandit
eng_Latn but it was the last house at the bottom of a narrow street
eng_Latn I certainly couldn't look after you then.
eng_Latn when he became a woman and has remained so ever since.
eng_Latn whereupon the huge creature trod short.
eng_Latn made him bury his face in that astonishing composition
eng_Latn as if she expected to come back tomorrow.
eng_Latn to prepare my own meals
eng_Latn I wish I had not taken that.
eng_Latn but his movement caused it to fall, face downwards, on the ground.
eng_Latn which induces me so readily to excuse you
eng_Latn will rain as often as it pleases me and may be needful.
eng_Latn with the great yellowy white walls of abandoned convents behind the rows of sombre green cypresses, that fact very modern in its spirit
eng_Latn she slipped her hand into her breast
eng_Latn everybody was asleep.
eng_Latn Don t tell me, don t tell me -you re an elephant.
eng_Latn you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from the same point of view.
eng_Latn I daresay their kind don't set much store by punctuality.
eng_Latn Like Dog and...
eng_Latn a shivering light filled the compartment.
eng_Latn were brought there to have their arms bound.
eng_Latn surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.
eng_Latn I agreed to risk it.
eng_Latn Colin the Castaway I presume!
eng_Latn but could not eat anything.
eng_Latn she was also very popular.
eng_Latn but seeing the direction of his eyes and their quick averting
eng_Latn I had injured wounded left my master.
eng_Latn which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house
eng_Latn as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming
eng_Latn I used to be the responsible one.
eng_Latn knocked off his hat twice
eng_Latn was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as white jessamine.
eng_Latn I am in no fear of you.
eng_Latn they re mained in the road below him.
eng_Latn I took the axe and smashed in the door.
eng_Latn but that was because his mother hadbeen notified that she was not needed.
eng_Latn but I suppose you had no tools to aid you
eng_Latn experienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who
eng_Latn waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to take.
eng_Latn that he sank down almost dead with fright.
eng_Latn a woman towards whom she had set out with a longing to carry some clearness and comfort into her beclouded youth.
eng_Latn of our humanity
eng_Latn most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own
eng_Latn since it begins to bear fruit.
eng_Latn with the tender age of his daughter
eng_Latn who have no remorse to disturb you.
eng_Latn I think that's how she'd want it.
eng_Latn GRRR. I am very angry! But in a minute I'm going to forgive them.
eng_Latn all the same, you must refuse him.
eng_Latn for he was no longer easily embarrassed.
eng_Latn I have to get to my desk.
eng_Latn come to me, and I will fill it.
eng_Latn trying to squash a particularly fat one into a pot.
eng_Latn he saw that the carved garden fence was broken
eng_Latn she decided to use the extension in the study.
eng_Latn laid on the very couch he had so feared of late.
eng_Latn I didn t recognise my feet before because I was looking at them upside down!
eng_Latn I shall go to see them from time to time.
eng_Latn he came into the room with more speed and noise than he intended.
eng_Latn that was his style
eng_Latn it's my birthday
eng_Latn we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.
eng_Latn Aye aye captain!
eng_Latn during which time, the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.
eng_Latn that I fully expected to see his head go down behind the counter
eng_Latn two men on horseback facing the ditch.
eng_Latn although he had learned nothing really satisfactory
eng_Latn Yum yumm!
eng_Latn Please don t judge her too harshlyWitch Hazel. She wouldn t have fallen from the sky if we hadn t dropped in.
eng_Latn resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.
eng_Latn with the sign burnt off with a plumber's blowflame
eng_Latn he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived
eng_Latn I can see a bright light... which is really good!
eng_Latn but when she saw his legs she laughed out loud.
eng_Latn stopped quite near the approaching train.
eng_Latn in time makes a 'prentice of him.
eng_Latn send me an owl if you find anything.
eng_Latn she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in complete possession of all her forces
eng_Latn my resolution is firmer than ever.
eng_Latn that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people
eng_Latn I remember one year when there were so many dogs that it was necessary to put it in the newspapers.
eng_Latn but something in her face made him decide not to.
eng_Latn the thing was altogether as represented in the circular, or at any rate so the agent had said.
eng_Latn IT RAINED FOR four years, eleven months, and two days.
eng_Latn because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all.
eng_Latn all tha' respectable.
eng_Latn most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it
eng_Latn Yes, so we could run up here!
eng_Latn a cloud of dust boiled up.
eng_Latn a pack of tallow candles
eng_Latn hoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him.
eng_Latn an unmitigated scoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse.
eng_Latn he felt that something had been torn out of him.
eng_Latn whereupon they stole off unperceived.
eng_Latn I told him, too, that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage
eng_Latn Yes - what s left of it. It's theperfect size for a mongoose –
eng_Latn with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to shout.
eng_Latn no importunate, overbearing
eng_Latn invited him into the very large living room, which was very impressive.
eng_Latn lower the general conditions of life in this island.
eng_Latn she might even come to know how and why he had lost her.
eng_Latn I don't read him that way, she said.
eng_Latn I knew his whole family history before he left.
eng_Latn he perceived his carriage
eng_Latn hit him with a hand that had a finger missing.
eng_Latn rose with a supple movement and looked round.
eng_Latn I wasn't exactly eager to reveal myself to a new wolf with an anger management problem
eng_Latn I alighted and went in.
eng_Latn they have been privately engaged to one another this long while.
eng_Latn I'll think about her.
eng_Latn agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go.
eng_Latn but a very noble way of erasing the past.
eng_Latn found myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide.
eng_Latn belonging to an overturned government.
eng_Latn I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell.
eng_Latn but remaining inactive nonetheless.
eng_Latn but he soon sighed
eng_Latn leaning against the head board with our four knees drawn up close together
eng_Latn that the delay of a month might not prove fatal was sufficient to cause him to be willing to wait, and that rather indifferently, for that length of time.
eng_Latn it is in no way interesting to you to know that.
eng_Latn that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it
eng_Latn removed it to a little distance from the owner.
eng_Latn cheered him and caused him to step along most briskly and gayly.
eng_Latn it says that, withdrawing a little from the others
eng_Latn I hope she caught no cold last night.
eng_Latn but she had been urged also by a vague discomfort.
eng_Latn the spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss.
eng_Latn buried them in a secret place
eng_Latn suddenly she realized that the room was not empty.
eng_Latn losing money is like pouring water on the sand.
eng_Latn but so ready to refuse the social obligations which went with them
eng_Latn because he was less likely to be blown off course.
eng_Latn I know just exactly how you feel.
eng_Latn I won't give away anything and to her less than any one!
eng_Latn of which nothing remained but pestilence.
eng_Latn They must wait till we re asleep before they start!
eng_Latn just a small change in the set of my mouth.
eng_Latn he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly.
eng_Latn that, after my telling your worship, if I don't mistake
eng_Latn he learned that there had been a great battle that evening.
eng_Latn I might be the undoing of some poor prelate yet.
eng_Latn so there was plenty of time for them to enjoy life.
eng_Latn very plain and rough in his exterior
eng_Latn I am very glad I did think of her.
eng_Latn there was not enough difference between them and others.
eng_Latn went to a car parked down the street.
eng_Latn it was time to settle down.
eng_Latn I relocking the vacant drawer.
eng_Latn her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing such a question.
eng_Latn but could not imagine how he had entered.
eng_Latn her face and cheek came very close to him
eng_Latn For gold is gold and diamonds are diamonds, but there are things worth much, much more.
eng_Latn felt himself tremble the least bit with excitement
eng_Latn so that she could become accustomed to the idea that he was her guardian and no longer her lover.
eng_Latn I just take the train from platform nine and three quarters
eng_Latn yet after a few minutes the bird came back.
eng_Latn but now to be more than twenty five is absurd.
eng_Latn drawing his sword
eng_Latn I shoved his hand away with unnecessary force.
eng_Latn just as the door handle turned.
eng_Latn Look at me Dog. I'm buff!
eng_Latn No, that would be silly Pug. They go camping.
eng_Latn I must leave you now, indeed.
eng_Latn while all the other muscles are strained and half started
eng_Latn I had put my chair away, and was going out of the room
eng_Latn generally while he read the paper by the pantry fire.
eng_Latn the better to support the part he had to play
eng_Latn on the third from recovering my company she complained of a headache, and left me.
eng_Latn the news stand a marble kiosk with a brass grill.
eng_Latn I should so like to see you at a ball.
eng_Latn creative genius and source of all wisdom on business and marketing
eng_Latn the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his harpoon
eng_Latn I thought of them myself.
eng_Latn I sighed and gave her the key.
eng_Latn starved at that, by the powers!
eng_Latn just a faint, musky trace of wolf odor
eng_Latn but without any order.
eng_Latn others, to the betraying of their country or their prince
eng_Latn emptying his glass flung it on the floor.
eng_Latn now I don't know what I've done with them!
eng_Latn so whatever befalls us is for our good.
eng_Latn she got the wounded man to bed, and remained to nurse him.
eng_Latn he wasn't giving us anything.
eng_Latn I was not able to work.
eng_Latn he cut his friend's throat like a sheep, and took the watch.
eng_Latn any lapses or tangles not heavily sponsored by others.
eng_Latn he had had enough of them
eng_Latn to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the river bank.
eng_Latn while I held the odious vermin in my hands
eng_Latn stopped to take counsel together.
eng_Latn continued to turn it.
eng_Latn I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way
eng_Latn sped off toward the castle
eng_Latn taking the four reals
eng_Latn Mr Wow. Do you know a lot aboutherrings?
eng_Latn almost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least.
eng_Latn as though it were heavy.
eng_Latn assuring him that no other treatment would be required
eng_Latn but I can tell lots of things are going on beneath the surface.
eng_Latn although the king at that time had no design against his life.
eng_Latn but whether this was due to equanimity of soul or to contradictoriness it would be difficult to say.
eng_Latn he strokes my hair gently.
eng_Latn I tried to forget everything else so I could concentrate.
eng_Latn will quiet them by bestowing your blessing upon them.
eng_Latn in law the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them
eng_Latn which he had torn to atoms.
eng_Latn I take this boy to the hospital wing!
eng_Latn This is a book about how to lookafter your dog and it is called...
eng_Latn she dropped to the cushioned seat with a little cry.
eng_Latn that gave me a chance to truly compose and resolve myself.
eng_Latn for the soul of the departed
eng_Latn that a fox had been found, and the whole pack, joining together
eng_Latn yes, it is indeed he who has so long
eng_Latn I can t wait to...
eng_Latn had been forgotten under the chestnut tree.
eng_Latn but not many had died there.
eng_Latn when he didn't need to.
eng_Latn then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.
eng_Latn notwithstanding and in spite of his armour, he milled him like a measure of wheat.
eng_Latn the uncut space was ten feet wide.
eng_Latn will not be impertinent, but, on the contrary, pertinent.
eng_Latn he flung it out of the window
eng_Latn making trip after trip until the old horse was lathered.
eng_Latn I did not then know the besetting sin of woman
eng_Latn I've never seen anything to equal her.
eng_Latn he declared he had no ear for this appeal.
eng_Latn but certainly she laughed and blushed and then cried out
eng_Latn it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening
eng_Latn I don't like your gown
eng_Latn she hastily disengaged herself
eng_Latn I have to go out of town for a day or two.
eng_Latn however dreadhis erring ways might seem?
eng_Latn you would make me weep, if such a thing were possible.
eng_Latn however insignificant they may appear to groveling vulgar minds
eng_Latn auburn hair, and a thin, fresh
eng_Latn it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.
eng_Latn but to me it's so serious, so intensely serious.
eng_Latn the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination
eng_Latn I can't, I feel so queer!
eng_Latn since this man who had nothing to expect from his comrade
eng_Latn so that the clock ticking on the mantelpiece beat like a hammer.
eng_Latn perhaps you'd better come, too
eng_Latn through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship.
eng_Latn he dashed out from behind the angel
eng_Latn here is another thing that now comes to me as some thing that I should say to you.
eng_Latn Or it would just look like a lampor candle from a cottage on the cliff top.
eng_Latn I went up to the window and leaned right out of it.
eng_Latn I remember a piece of poetry this here guy wrote down.
eng_Latn the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the public.
eng_Latn nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture without any other aim.
eng_Latn the company followed them in due order.
eng_Latn how long you stopped andfor what.
eng_Latn I won't stay more than a minute.
eng_Latn they added to these such other forcible arguments
eng_Latn I'm not much of a one for saying pretty things.
eng_Latn stared at the person who had addressed him
eng_Latn but it didn't teach me how to live with them.
eng_Latn he was cold.
eng_Latn he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.
eng_Latn unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights errant also.
eng_Latn I cannot tell what will happen to me or what will happen to any of us.
eng_Latn said let him try
eng_Latn Ready,
eng_Latn at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship.
eng_Latn it cannot be a matter of chance.
eng_Latn I try thinking of a follow up line.
eng_Latn with no one but himself to defend it.
eng_Latn I tried to steer the conversation back to trite paths.
eng_Latn for you have before you your worthy brother and your good sister in law.
eng_Latn but his resources were now exhausted
eng_Latn be very nice as though he cared for her as much as ever now
eng_Latn he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul.
eng_Latn they had neglected to keep their children in school in any one place.
eng_Latn what I thought!
eng_Latn but I made little way with him.
eng_Latn I'm Tiny.
eng_Latn had it not been for an adverse destiny, that beloved monarch would this day have been among us.
eng_Latn I was afraid you'd take it like this!
eng_Latn I waded with what haste I could
eng_Latn no one had the heart to ask him to redo the whole print order.
eng_Latn never stopped until he had run a mile or more.
eng_Latn kissed each of the two large tears.
eng_Latn was much beyond her daily reach
eng_Latn I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded.
eng_Latn if he let it slip it would not return.
eng_Latn but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him
eng_Latn stamped his feet in his impatience.
eng_Latn nor be to blame
eng_Latn stiffly holding a stuffed quail in its mouth.
eng_Latn Which way now, Wow?
eng_Latn entreating him to allow some delay
eng_Latn but wait, and read for yourself
eng_Latn cook their porridge.
eng_Latn And so the Troll learned the skills to build or fix something, and made a real difference for all.
eng_Latn that the delay of a month might not prove fatal was sufficient to cause him to be willing to wait, and that rather indifferently, for that length of time.
eng_Latn I will procure your pardon.
eng_Latn Uh... wait, Pug. I'm not sure that s such a good idea...
eng_Latn Really Dog?
eng_Latn her eyes filling with tears
eng_Latn she suffered her first sense of displeasure at being home
eng_Latn by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute
eng_Latn yet while the two horses were busy in conversation
eng_Latn She may have said it first.
eng_Latn who had screamed.
eng_Latn for it is no very easy matter to pass from one extreme to another.
eng_Latn there was certainly an unusual feeling between them.
eng_Latn decided to sit quietly where they were
eng_Latn a most worthy old man, and what dignity!
eng_Latn Now, without showing me, put itback in the pack.
eng_Latn until the deed is done
eng_Latn One dish of fresh cream.
eng_Latn unknown to others, often unconfessed to herself!
eng_Latn These may help.
eng_Latn but it didn't teach me how to live with them.
eng_Latn Yiipp
eng_Latn he had been humiliated before her, and had lost her forever, leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory.
eng_Latn but close enough for his protection.
eng_Latn I know he'll get it all right.
eng_Latn to the solitary box in the coffee room and the familiar waiter again.
eng_Latn the real express sent after him
eng_Latn if you repent there is still time.
eng_Latn they succeeded in making the priest sit down again
eng_Latn whose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention
eng_Latn I have a mind to play the mischief with thee, in a way
eng_Latn because the stress of his feeling was more than he could bear.
eng_Latn Two down. One to...WOAH!
eng_Latn was open and nearly full.
eng_Latn I kind of hoped it wouldn't soon.
eng_Latn as a man I found a pleasure in her
eng_Latn I've finished what I had to do, and I am going.
eng_Latn to enjoy the sport of the search.
eng_Latn what it is our duty to do.
eng_Latn but he does know his own pocket.
eng_Latn as if it would be unreasonable to suppose anything else of him.
eng_Latn gazed at it, and then around him, confusedly.
eng_Latn for though the elder was attached to me
eng_Latn then, in the space of three seconds and a half, everything had changed
eng_Latn but these were not exactly the reasons why, for instance, the whole surveying camp, from the youngest of the young men to their mature chief
eng_Latn I have now quite settled in my new rooms .
eng_Latn he said you'd resigned.
eng_Latn a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds.
eng_Latn none of these durst return to their native countries
eng_Latn so she would never again allow me to undergo the exertion
eng_Latn so they'll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast
eng_Latn each, deceived by the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last.
eng_Latn but at least his eyes had lost that awful dead fish look.
eng_Latn then I went to take her up with one hand by the waist.
eng_Latn It was fun watching him makepictures for a while Dog, but can we go home now?
eng_Latn tugging at his arm.
eng_Latn he had turned his friend into a badger.
eng_Latn I'm sure she would be delighted to see you both as well.
eng_Latn every day I am faced by the possibility that he may force me to live with him.
eng_Latn slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume.
eng_Latn he had been ushered into the drawing room
eng_Latn save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live
eng_Latn but there was something in his voice that surprised me.
eng_Latn putting the light near his face
eng_Latn and not wishing to carry it too far
eng_Latn don't let me suffer more for you, just now.
eng_Latn I was going to be sick.
eng_Latn not a confession to the crimes of the world
eng_Latn without display and without perceptible difficulty.
eng_Latn an odd thing happened to me about a month ago.
eng_Latn I love the sound of them.
eng_Latn I'm frightfully busy.
eng_Latn well dressed on a week day.
eng_Latn I'll say the first with all my heart
eng_Latn made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger
eng_Latn till they come to dress themselves
eng_Latn she was altogether a mistake
eng_Latn surrendered without honor.
eng_Latn he seemed to struggle against the mortal sleep.
eng_Latn he lifted his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.
eng_Latn for how are you to succeed unless love is laid under contribution?
eng_Latn previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.
eng_Latn only, the pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust
eng_Latn who you said had 30,000 livres
eng_Latn Oh no. We re Dog and Pug. We re notbad at all.
eng_Latn Yes this is nice. I feel so much better...
eng_Latn he did so immediately
eng_Latn the yellow church swelled like a throat with the sound of sad singing.
eng_Latn as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy
eng_Latn the pages were soiled and thumbed with use.
eng_Latn I just love your roses
eng_Latn I have to think of my reasons why not. I'm not going to let you draw me into a discussion of my reasons why not
eng_Latn had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case.
eng_Latn I would have died before I betrayed them.
eng_Latn Nom nom nom. This tastes like...(Shock) Fish. Dogs don t like Fish. FISSSSSSH!
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder, Pug!
eng_Latn covered it over with a couple of other bundles
eng_Latn but he's one of our side
eng_Latn here the court was convulsed
eng_Latn as wide awake as if he had never slept.
eng_Latn shook the sleeper to rouse him.
eng_Latn unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men
eng_Latn for I am not a knight errant and never expect to be one
eng_Latn I shoved past them, not caring if they realized my presence.
eng_Latn the dread of officialdom with its nightmarish parody of administration without law, without security, and without justice.
eng_Latn but he's too busy messing around to get down to her.
eng_Latn which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour
eng_Latn a preference which I never believed him to deserve.
eng_Latn I showed you this morning that I had a heart, did I not, count?
eng_Latn while two other customers walked about the shop, drinking tea from crystal glasses.
eng_Latn well dressed on a week day.
eng_Latn then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls
eng_Latn paused to note if by any chance any one had observed her, now looked cautiously about
eng_Latn as a boy went rushing after her.
eng_Latn was on his way to becoming a saint.
eng_Latn to dig hollows in the earth with their swords.
eng_Latn Oh dear. I think Pug is about toput the king in the picture!
eng_Latn I went here and there collecting it.
eng_Latn upstairs almost all the rooms were finished.
eng_Latn I don't know what you want me to say.
eng_Latn how dear and comforting they could be
eng_Latn that he should talk of encouragement
eng_Latn I asked you for help and you wouldn't give it to me.
eng_Latn A-a-are we there yet?
eng_Latn which had become extremely important
eng_Latn it does you good to get out of it sometimes into a bachelor atmosphere
eng_Latn even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground.
eng_Latn the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men.
eng_Latn went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he went.
eng_Latn rsula was the only one who dared disturb his, abstraction.
eng_Latn I've asked him to come down here
eng_Latn I'll tell you everything.
eng_Latn peered over the edge.
eng_Latn smiling in spite of her sorrow.
eng_Latn I know what was the trouble!
eng_Latn but had some banknotes left over in her wallet.
eng_Latn I'm busy now.
eng_Latn they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground.
eng_Latn I wandered to the table beside the bed. I picked up the book.
eng_Latn when I got round to him, not he.
eng_Latn he showed her for the first time that she had a rival in his love.
eng_Latn as if they were cattle on the hoof.
eng_Latn as impossible as to fling down a child one is carrying in one's arms.
eng_Latn I must outfit a ship to bring the treasure to the surface.
eng_Latn How intriguing!
eng_Latn I ground my teeth together.
eng_Latn I remarked the change in the shape of the prints after that point
eng_Latn I don't want to hear that you feel that way.
eng_Latn when they heard the clatter of three horses' hoofs on the road not far from the shed
eng_Latn I have to go home he said
eng_Latn in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him.
eng_Latn I've got a better idea.
eng_Latn I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts.
eng_Latn but I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than for arguments.
eng_Latn the apparition advanced more quickly towards her
eng_Latn I send it to her by you.
eng_Latn I cannot even say of what it is expressive to me now
eng_Latn or refused to have a telephone for many years.
eng_Latn I feared my brain was disturbed by my sufferings and misfortunes.
eng_Latn There s four...and five...
eng_Latn I am extremely sorry that the circumstance should have made such an unpleasant impression upon you!
eng_Latn or we will kill you and your gods!
eng_Latn where I continued during my stay
eng_Latn in the light of day he seemed to be his old self again
eng_Latn he presently recovered his spirits and good humour
eng_Latn I told you
eng_Latn I have sent for one, and, if she dies, I shall hold you responsible.
eng_Latn that is, if you want me to.
eng_Latn in some women its as regular as the phases of the moon, in others its not so predictable.
eng_Latn only in search of rest from life's turmoil
eng_Latn then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right.
eng_Latn stolen a horse and such a horse!
eng_Latn who moved heaven and earth in his interest publicly
eng_Latn unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are enchanters
eng_Latn the best of it was that the innkeeper's lamp went out
eng_Latn ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture
eng_Latn in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him
eng_Latn because I was under water to my neck.
eng_Latn was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them,
eng_Latn I shall put you in the corner.
eng_Latn I sawed it up and down four times.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know... giraffes haveblue tongues.
eng_Latn then he paused
eng_Latn had married a florid widow with property and three boys
eng_Latn I'll tell her what I think of her and then walk straight out of the house!
eng_Latn a hand, which seemed to her enormous, had just seized the handle, and lifted it vigorously.
eng_Latn was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
eng_Latn my arms frozen to my body.
eng_Latn in order to match the shade of green precisely he looked at the thing itself
eng_Latn but they could not get to sleep
eng_Latn I will do it yet.
eng_Latn though, after all, 900,000 francs are worth regretting
eng_Latn he did up a hundred francswhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll
eng_Latn you would have been taken in
eng_Latn so you'd better get packed.
eng_Latn I knew it wasn't a mistake to come!
eng_Latn that everyone would forget about it, and his name would remain unsullied.
eng_Latn No, we re hot dogs.
eng_Latn they would not be able to spare enough warm bodies to man the plows.
eng_Latn but was to be passed on most artfully from one to the other until evening should be over.
eng_Latn where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here.
eng_Latn but he cursed and made a disturbance to attract a policeman
eng_Latn without telling them
eng_Latn meant to leave him calmly.
eng_Latn as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions
eng_Latn he showed him the bucketful of geese and hens
eng_Latn he had long held in public opinion
eng_Latn save me again!
eng_Latn but what's got into your head?
eng_Latn I had only just come home
eng_Latn before I could get far enough into the sea
eng_Latn I gave him a short account of some particulars
eng_Latn with almost as much cruelty as the pains of love.
eng_Latn but he wrote it the day before that
eng_Latn I only wish I could thank you for it.
eng_Latn she was as though deprived of the power to think.
eng_Latn First I draw some circles. Then anoblong, see? Look, new doggy friends. I ve made you a tree!
eng_Latn she drew in a deep breath, and, turning back her prominent eye till the white looked bloodshot,
eng_Latn but now sure of what she must do.
eng_Latn I discerned he was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity.
eng_Latn I regret to say that my conscience has not troubled me at all about deserting you.
eng_Latn Hello. I'm Dog and this is Pug.We re so sorry for waking you.
eng_Latn if the person was caught
eng_Latn I havent got a single skeleton left to hide from you
eng_Latn set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire
eng_Latn rummaging it all over
eng_Latn I hadn't realized that there were others with him until I'd heard the loud laughter.
eng_Latn but immediately began to badger her about helping with his transfer.
eng_Latn the venom in your eyes will dissolve them in a few hours.
eng_Latn Help! Somebody! Anybody!
eng_Latn that he was master of it.
eng_Latn after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest
eng_Latn this is the kitchen
eng_Latn but the girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early
eng_Latn It's not that funny Dog.
eng_Latn so that she did not even cry out.
eng_Latn it couldn't possibly be anyone else
eng_Latn a veritable soul pilot in her cross grained, uniformed way.
eng_Latn then he walked slowly back the way that he had come
eng_Latn that is to you.
eng_Latn And here we are in what lies beneath.
eng_Latn what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded
eng_Latn shame of this had in part at least been forgotten.
eng_Latn I don't want to talk about it.
eng_Latn I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people
eng_Latn by then a man has done his best work, all he does after that is repetition.
eng_Latn to enable futile politicians and state managers to fritter it away on electorally useful white elephants.
eng_Latn I hope it doesn't take me the whole blasted afternoon.
eng_Latn the clerk of the court announcing in a clear, thin
eng_Latn looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.
eng_Latn though he had only been a short time under a surveyor
eng_Latn but that would expose me to unpleasant consequences.
eng_Latn a significance which is to vanish as the waters
eng_Latn than a lamp is like sunshine.
eng_Latn until she took the phone off the hook.
eng_Latn he did up a hundred francswhich he had in a cupboard, into a roll
eng_Latn I apologise if I seemed critical.
eng_Latn this will be the third time
eng_Latn tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl into her empty food tray.
eng_Latn And you re not Dog.
eng_Latn at every turn she will fall into a thousand blunders
eng_Latn on which I shall do deeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come.
eng_Latn I went to the well, seeking the alchemist.
eng_Latn yet I allow he preceded me in right of his post.
eng_Latn you empty her locker and split.
eng_Latn I must not at least sink into the degradation of being pensioned for work that I never achieved.
eng_Latn I must speak to you for a few minutes somewhere
eng_Latn what looked like a thick, flesh colored rubber glove.
eng_Latn I stepped over the great western gate.
eng_Latn walked slowly backward and forward, to let those people see I had no intent to run away.
eng_Latn papa asked what was the matter
eng_Latn when I wasn't around
eng_Latn but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement.
eng_Latn when the front door opened
eng_Latn in order to force him to raise his head a secondtime.
eng_Latn Now I know why it's called the throne room Pug. Because we keep being thrown out of it!
eng_Latn there's a haystack
eng_Latn fine gentlemen are going twenty for a penny?
eng_Latn must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye beer, onions,
eng_Latn she was still standing there like a figure of doom, with the two letters
eng_Latn theirbones have turned to stone.
eng_Latn And you dug another hole.
eng_Latn was so careless as to let a huge frog not perceiving it slip out of his pail.
eng_Latn that he may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady
eng_Latn about two and a half years later, at the beginning of '23
eng_Latn spent half the value of his store on medicines and pastimes
eng_Latn I did not close my eyes that night
eng_Latn I had already formed the intention of asking her to lend it to me some day.
eng_Latn once in every moon, and return the said messenger back if so required safe to our imperial presence.
eng_Latn You re the best playground I ve ever been friends with, Dave!
eng_Latn when over thirty four years of age
eng_Latn but adding that professionally he had been unwilling to doanything for her.
eng_Latn I was gonna go tom catting and here I ain't had time to do none of them things.
eng_Latn there was no real relief now until this problem should be definitely solved.
eng_Latn being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance.
eng_Latn I should like you to ply him well with the victuals, my dears
eng_Latn he would have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always observed towards her
eng_Latn he shrugged and laughed softly.
eng_Latn we had nothing before us
eng_Latn but she was altogether too excited to let the matter rest.
eng_Latn wrench that made me cry out.
eng_Latn but to keep and preserve it
eng_Latn I took them up, one by one, in my hands
eng_Latn Oh good. We love walkies.
eng_Latn I had never experienced the sensation.
eng_Latn so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word.
eng_Latn it was difficult to feed and lodge humans, much less animals.
eng_Latn a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended.
eng_Latn she had never seen it quite like this.
eng_Latn he can't do anything about it.
eng_Latn I don't know how much more drama I can stand.
eng_Latn but he felt it necessary to assert himself.
eng_Latn he should be put in prison and hanged
eng_Latn with him give vent to his joy over the precious pearl he had gained in having established his wife's purity
eng_Latn Of course Dog. Ta-dah!.
eng_Latn there were scarcely six months between them.
eng_Latn that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to do.
eng_Latn his left cheek, shoulder and arm bruised, but not otherwise injured
eng_Latn withdrawing to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.
eng_Latn he warned me after fifteen minutes of silence.
eng_Latn as if waiting on a school bench to hear their final grades.
eng_Latn I don't think we need to go that far.
eng_Latn by a bodiless voice no one but he could hear
eng_Latn with an expression of infinite gratitude.
eng_Latn I'm a going to see what's going on here.
eng_Latn you grab anything you need from your room
eng_Latn but he enjoyed the way she cringed.
eng_Latn they all froze when they saw me.
eng_Latn I don't care what it's interrupting.
eng_Latn make this man to recover
eng_Latn but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate.
eng_Latn he searched, hastily fluttering the pages, and said
eng_Latn it has an enormous success here.
eng_Latn those on horseback with wheel lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords
eng_Latn I hadn't noticed till nowit was a nice day.
eng_Latn then went back again to the beach.
eng_Latn but not mad.
eng_Latn temperature 45 degrees
eng_Latn I walked about the chamber most of the time.
eng_Latn but could not eat anything.
eng_Latn for all is lost now!
eng_Latn what my own feeling is you already know
eng_Latn I negotiated with him about the pony.
eng_Latn her thoughts wandered in a confused maze
eng_Latn skipped out of the parlour and into the road
eng_Latn So places everybody. Let's get ready for a rehearsal.
eng_Latn saving our own lives, with the extremest care.
eng_Latn worth forty cents in those easy times
eng_Latn drawing her chair up to the table
eng_Latn my soul thirsted for a pure draught.
eng_Latn stop up your excavation carefully do not work any more
eng_Latn I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! We just ran around and around. I know what King Arthur needs!
eng_Latn after sending out the cable message for the information of a more or less attentive world.
eng_Latn he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water
eng_Latn I want him to go away
eng_Latn the best he could suggest was that both were to try
eng_Latn I've got some copy for you to run downstairs.
eng_Latn I had better go into the house and die.
eng_Latn who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready.
eng_Latn I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting
eng_Latn I don't know, I told him honestly.
eng_Latn afterwards general on sea
eng_Latn backed off, his stumps jerking in alarm.
eng_Latn get me ready something hot for breakfast
eng_Latn who apparently was on the look out for him a smooth
eng_Latn Pug, do you think...
eng_Latn for having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.
eng_Latn I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing after that, and he didn't.
eng_Latn they gently struck each other's right hoof before
eng_Latn wishing that he had died, and that everything would end forever at that moment.
eng_Latn naturally made him look forward the more eagerly to the happy termination of courtship.
eng_Latn I saw that the table next to ours, left vacant for three days, was to be occupied once more.
eng_Latn I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils.
eng_Latn And some bridge bits might fall off at any moment...
eng_Latn for there is nothing worse than singing under suffering.
eng_Latn How curious and curiouser!
eng_Latn as the only one who has the right of doing so
eng_Latn which at first and up to now at least had seemed to be drawing them indivisibly together.
eng_Latn when you walked a hundred paces beside that workman,
eng_Latn on view at that hour in his coffin
eng_Latn where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years.
eng_Latn to recover my breath and loss of spirits.
eng_Latn was beginning to sense, extracted the slip from his pocket and turned it over to the others
eng_Latn we believe thata perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living.
eng_Latn only that it was a letter from him from the man she loved.
eng_Latn not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies.
eng_Latn put his hand beneath her elbow courteously to guide her
eng_Latn I want to know how long I'm gonna have to be here.
eng_Latn I shall be back in five minutes.
eng_Latn this forms a part of the general death of the order
eng_Latn you know he always has wise advice to give.
eng_Latn a quiet sea.
eng_Latn ...I love the peace and quiet reading a good b-
eng_Latn Holmes?
eng_Latn there came an awful longing to weep and cry
eng_Latn a slender elf woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.
eng_Latn his ass must have been out to the wind when he put that last line on
eng_Latn but the army had slept six hours and was moving.
eng_Latn all too human creatures.
eng_Latn again she earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
eng_Latn the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons
eng_Latn his breeches were also of blue cloth, and his cap of the same colour
eng_Latn considering what to say.
eng_Latn I knew she was dead.
eng_Latn I can make this right if you give me the chance.
eng_Latn a prosperous lawyer and widower and speculator of this region, who
eng_Latn bade him furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings
eng_Latn found my wife and family in good health.
eng_Latn Oops.
eng_Latn he was lying on his stomach in bed
eng_Latn meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity
eng_Latn but the sound echoed dismally into the silence, and they stopped fairly quickly.
eng_Latn but nothing compared to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses.
eng_Latn apparently there's nothing interesting for you to do at night besides study.
eng_Latn for there were snakes swimming in the pools or clustering in knots around their brinks.
eng_Latn isn't that suffering!
eng_Latn Pug, our questing song please.
eng_Latn I waited to hear some answers in a human voice
eng_Latn but two days after, I went to her funeral
eng_Latn I wish you'd let me mind my own business.
eng_Latn thou wilt find they have only bodies of air
eng_Latn we picked up another three just as we were leaving.
eng_Latn I went on from that.
eng_Latn he was lying on his stomach in bed
eng_Latn but it never materially varied.
eng_Latn for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be
eng_Latn peeped into the hut.
eng_Latn There s a word - a special word forwhen lots of animals are frightened and begin to run together.
eng_Latn they let me out with a gun in my hand and a free pardon to do more killin'.
eng_Latn I am sure that it was really the sob of a woman.
eng_Latn in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
eng_Latn I am not exactly thanking you
eng_Latn others, to the betraying of their country or their prince
eng_Latn saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed.
eng_Latn but in every other way he looked more like a young man than a schoolboy.
eng_Latn I'll wait till he leaves
eng_Latn I guess I'll always be sorry for that.
eng_Latn I can't wait.
eng_Latn Space. The final front yard.
eng_Latn tears came as he spoke.
eng_Latn But did it show us how to catch those naughty bookshop mice Pug?
eng_Latn I know the tune for him.
eng_Latn thought that this man of delicate and melancholy mind, physically almost a cripple,
eng_Latn I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet, like that of a cable
eng_Latn except that it was determined by feelings of friendship
eng_Latn Thank you, Dog and Pug. Now I can deliver this.
eng_Latn my mother burst out crying.
eng_Latn I knew it was you when I looked out the window.
eng_Latn since the new system of feeding has come in
eng_Latn who then modified the entire search plan
eng_Latn until the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well
eng_Latn she has served him and he is gone
eng_Latn I'm sure he is around here somewhere.
eng_Latn I just threw myself into the silky leather seat and cranked the engine while my knees were still crunched up under the steering wheel.
eng_Latn I held one hand out to catch her, but she righted herself before it was necessary.
eng_Latn I wish I was a Doris.
eng_Latn but it's rotten nonsense.
eng_Latn I stared him down.
eng_Latn hoped, in a short time, I should be able to tell him wonders.
eng_Latn And that every happy journey ends in a happy home.
eng_Latn but he'll be here soon
eng_Latn he cried, needlessly indicating the direction.
eng_Latn maybe that's why I'm here for terms.
eng_Latn he felt as if he had been visited by a ghost from his lost youth.
eng_Latn for he at once comprehended its meaning perfectly
eng_Latn a lean, haggard face, ragged beard and hair, and had walked in limping, with a crooked branch of a tree for a staff.
eng_Latn run the same chance that I run
eng_Latn I then took my tackling.
eng_Latn with this she began to weep in earnest
eng_Latn so the amiable couple parted.
eng_Latn looking for what they say are called adventures, but what I call misfortunes
eng_Latn I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store for him.
eng_Latn threw down the placard he was carrying and flung his arms about her.
eng_Latn for fifty three years, seven months, and eleven days and nights.
eng_Latn I think darling is better.
eng_Latn You re a little shy aren t you. Just like Camille.
eng_Latn before the horror was half an hour old
eng_Latn laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table
eng_Latn drew a stamped paper from his pocket, and began to prepare his report.
eng_Latn but I'm damned if I sympathize.
eng_Latn for of all impossibilities the greatest is to write one that will satisfy and please all readers.
eng_Latn so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years
eng_Latn I trembled at the first effects of this intelligence
eng_Latn with this the dance wound up, to the great enjoyment of the beholders.
eng_Latn I couldn't stand not knowing.
eng_Latn the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the best supper that was in his power.
eng_Latn I was glad someone was trying to keep him from starving due to his lack of cooking ability.
eng_Latn but it was impossible to delay her at such a crisis
eng_Latn you know, like a sort of avenging spirit.
eng_Latn I will if she does
eng_Latn THE next morning we fell early to work
eng_Latn for soon after the queen bestowed him on a lady of high quality
eng_Latn I'd hate to have him get anything on me.
eng_Latn hen the rest followed
eng_Latn or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of protrusion.
eng_Latn with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face.
eng_Latn I'll do whatever I can to make you happy now.
eng_Latn I'm not telling anyone what to do.
eng_Latn owing, I suppose, to the sudden storm.
eng_Latn but they were both pure metal.
eng_Latn he had grown more and more used to his own intention, and by now distinctly perceived the feasibility of its execution.
eng_Latn I'm afraid she has to be watched all the time.
eng_Latn if you've nothing to eat,
eng_Latn I don't think we need to go that far.
eng_Latn worried and suddenly more frightened than before.
eng_Latn which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night.
eng_Latn who could galvanize the most shiftless negro into energy.
eng_Latn I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown
eng_Latn when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony.
eng_Latn graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night.
eng_Latn Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
eng_Latn I am badly in need of money.
eng_Latn she began immediately talking of other things, as though they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment.
eng_Latn but of fortitude and courage they cannot.
eng_Latn I must go and bar the doors quick
eng_Latn waiting, until it should be introduced by some decisive event.
eng_Latn plunged head first into the water.
eng_Latn shot right through the twelve rings.
eng_Latn he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him.
eng_Latn than under the circumstances she feared he would be.
eng_Latn that I might destroy him, and cover myself with glory.
eng_Latn testifying in every way to their great joy at her return.
eng_Latn I turned slowly to stare at him, raising my eyebrows.
eng_Latn call out the militia.
eng_Latn I take a deep breath and stand up.
eng_Latn if you should survive this encounter and fall
eng_Latn I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily
eng_Latn sought to seize him by the hand or place a gratefulpat upon his arm or shoulder.
eng_Latn cold chicken maybe
eng_Latn until the final dossier emerged with the stamp of approval.
eng_Latn I'm against them
eng_Latn my mother and I were well taken care of.
eng_Latn went into a little shop
eng_Latn You appear to have a problem?
eng_Latn having summed up three leading reasons for complete success
eng_Latn Serves us right!
eng_Latn but that time had passed and the effect was grown faint.
eng_Latn but at the same instant the man raised his light, which flashed in his face
eng_Latn This handle must be turned to keep the beam of light moving.
eng_Latn I outfitted you and sent you to find diamonds for me.
eng_Latn held four roosters and upward of forty hens.
eng_Latn when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea
eng_Latn he was a dairy farmer.
eng_Latn that won't be forgotten after I'm dead.
eng_Latn he all but fell over on to the chest
eng_Latn the sovereignty of man over himself.
eng_Latn but she struggled, and let it pass.
eng_Latn Thanks to Dog and Pug I'm not scared of jumping any more.
eng_Latn he had only shouted for luck.
eng_Latn I can blow out mine.
eng_Latn I could maybe ask him what he thinks
eng_Latn the woman who had crept in to steal and defile
eng_Latn that had so completely absorbed his own childhood and youth
eng_Latn he said you'd resigned.
eng_Latn hazarding the usual reply.
eng_Latn the bandit raised his head.
eng_Latn which had been falling for almost an hour now.
eng_Latn by instinct, a stand with his hands behind him in front of the fireplace.
eng_Latn at least not without moving someone else
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Dog?
eng_Latn but none on their faces, nor any thing more than a sort of down on the rest of their bodies, except about the anus and pudenda.
eng_Latn it struck sharp on the inn door
eng_Latn the kitchen maid, and the coachman had given warning.
eng_Latn I'll prompt anyone who forgets the rules!
eng_Latn sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter,
eng_Latn I soon fell into some acquaintance, and was very hospitably received.
eng_Latn the kitchen maid, and the coachman had given warning.
eng_Latn I can't even remember how to do it now.
eng_Latn we came to a long kind of building, made of timber stuck in the ground
eng_Latn but they seemed to be on good terms now.
eng_Latn I checked she was correct again.
eng_Latn abutting it a small greengrocer's and next to that a tumble down tobacconist's.
eng_Latn one single soldier left behind
eng_Latn they left him untouched
eng_Latn Mices! Come back here. I ve never read a book before. I don t know my way round.
eng_Latn but my wife will not have it in the drawing room.
eng_Latn I'll believe I'll get it.
eng_Latn her small, slight fingers!
eng_Latn presented itself to his mind
eng_Latn might turn out to be the wrong thing.
eng_Latn whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony.
eng_Latn this belief produced another dread.
eng_Latn you would betray me I never even thought of that
eng_Latn to tell me who you are and the cause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a brute beast,
eng_Latn I do like a ship with a sail.
eng_Latn I was gratified by the way she blanched at his obvious intent.
eng_Latn even his lips were black
eng_Latn if you like him to try experiments on your hospital patients
eng_Latn we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation.
eng_Latn this man, accustomed as he was to the sight of pain, could not keep back a tear that fell on his shirt frill.
eng_Latn suggested the plan of going over to see the grandmother.
eng_Latn I wish there was a way we could have night and day at the same time.
eng_Latn that the fellow is innocent
eng_Latn I can see you clearly, Pug.
eng_Latn was that which the angels announced on the night that was our day
eng_Latn I'll do that for you.
eng_Latn but it never materially varied.
eng_Latn the shoulder is just bandaged.
eng_Latn Pug, I think I owe you an apology. I did not ask you to join in our game.
eng_Latn I read of it yesterday by chance.
eng_Latn which he had so impatiently awaited and to which
eng_Latn I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me.
eng_Latn in bow ties and dinner jackets.
eng_Latn I should be glad to have an idea of the forms in which such things are done in practice.
eng_Latn I said it accidentally, but let the word stand
eng_Latn calculated to shock his trust in final causes, including the adaptation of fine young women to purplefaced bachelors.
eng_Latn I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch.
eng_Latn so far as it is straining through me
eng_Latn of about twelve feet square, and ten high
eng_Latn apropos, what is become of him?
eng_Latn it was brought me from the tavern and only that morning, only that morning I wanted to forgive him everything, everything even his treachery!
eng_Latn that vulture the very creature he creates.
eng_Latn hoped there were many like him.
eng_Latn but at all events you can hardly refuse it the tribute of your interest.
eng_Latn he still had enough love to ask her to soap him.
eng_Latn then taking his flute and a few books from his desk
eng_Latn my colleagues will want to enter into the occasion!
eng_Latn with her wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer!Yip. Wooh
eng_Latn I tell you to cool it down.
eng_Latn he was her uncle perhaps, or perhaps her father, to attend the coronation.
eng_Latn but inwardly he grieved and was furious.
eng_Latn she asks, voice high and fake innocent.
eng_Latn which will be just the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them.
eng_Latn a little room with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor
eng_Latn she's sorry she ever came home, I daresay!
eng_Latn might be known to none but himself
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder Pug.
eng_Latn by that very means keep himself in the track of far reaching investigation.
eng_Latn she attacked the paper faster, peeling it away in long, ragged strips.
eng_Latn her father delegated to her the authority to run the house
eng_Latn swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road.
eng_Latn I am not used to stringing words together properly
eng_Latn I went into the wigwam
eng_Latn enabled me to find it without difficulty.
eng_Latn I advised her to try putting him in the ice cellar.
eng_Latn for everything around her was always exciting.
eng_Latn I had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things.
eng_Latn why not fourteen hundred?
eng_Latn I don't know that I blame them.
eng_Latn I gotta see them folks that's gone out on the road.
eng_Latn never knowing he suffered.
eng_Latn It's only Lee and Bella s bedtime. You have to read a book.
eng_Latn using every filthy word in her particular vocabulary.
eng_Latn an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them.
eng_Latn that my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely repugnant to my own nature
eng_Latn that you have come to pay the four pound ten I owe him.
eng_Latn it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth
eng_Latn I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.
eng_Latn I'll send for you.
eng_Latn the bandit raised his head.
eng_Latn for the sagacity and smell of this bird enables him to discover his quarry at a great distance.
eng_Latn I checked them all out.
eng_Latn I handed her a book on cookies and bars.
eng_Latn that he was having a good time, and that everyone was pleased.
eng_Latn I left my cap in the car, I believe,
eng_Latn she knocked on the door and handed the dress to her mother.
eng_Latn till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town
eng_Latn We must stay close together or else we might get...
eng_Latn he had to wait for more than fifteen minutes for the recipient to come out of her bath.
eng_Latn I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet
eng_Latn her body heat keeping the sensors from sounding the alarm.
eng_Latn on the contrary, she turned her back on me and took to flight
eng_Latn but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.
eng_Latn as she had helped him to discover happiness.
eng_Latn I was making believe to warm my bum
eng_Latn I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair.
eng_Latn we couldn' wait.
eng_Latn this is the best of all the books of this kind that have been written
eng_Latn who in his thirty sixth year at the opening of this history was now in his fiftieth
eng_Latn it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.
eng_Latn I guess the real facts is that I don't know nothin' much about such things.
eng_Latn she had been able to escape the letter itself.
eng_Latn which of late had always been kept locked
eng_Latn though certainly exhausted
eng_Latn I shall see, now, with my own eyes. I shall see all.
eng_Latn as I shall relate in its proper place.
eng_Latn I came on something which was certainly new.
eng_Latn said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event.
eng_Latn I'm going to find the thermostat and turn the heat up.
eng_Latn I'm ripe to go fifty fifty on a doughnut.
eng_Latn Getting the legs right.
eng_Latn have him at our mercy before he can resist.
eng_Latn bouquets were placed in a row the whole length of the table
eng_Latn but the milk can was a perfect masterpiece.
eng_Latn so she sewed herself a coarse cassock that she simply put over her
eng_Latn enable it to ramble at its pleasure.
eng_Latn And what I want to draw too. (Callsout) Mice! Naughty mices!
eng_Latn with which she solaces herself at her work.
eng_Latn he could hardly hold himself
eng_Latn now he's come into the business.
eng_Latn wearing a veil to conceal her face.
eng_Latn I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side door, which was fortunately near.
eng_Latn who is now in his mid forties
eng_Latn as I rode on, the gloom cleared.
eng_Latn but said good night again, in a steady voice
eng_Latn but he saw by the face of the countess that it was not yet time for him to go.
eng_Latn Night is really just a different kind of day.
eng_Latn went to sleep where he fell.
eng_Latn looking at her sister in law
eng_Latn which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber.
eng_Latn gave him a good blow with the flat side of it
eng_Latn I could answer that last one.
eng_Latn the gate firmly bolted behind him.
eng_Latn backed against the walls
eng_Latn but I am wrong to dispute with my master.
eng_Latn then cooked some bacon in the frying pan for supper
eng_Latn hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it from him.
eng_Latn I love books about the wonders of the...Earth?
eng_Latn he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floor screwed chair
eng_Latn achieving them again in gossip.
eng_Latn now this head is not to be seen anywhere about
eng_Latn so we climbed the slope of heath together.
eng_Latn it was the priest who succeeded in reconciling him to them.
eng_Latn to which I owned my resemblance in every part
eng_Latn they left him untouched
eng_Latn I shall be at the cottage this evening
eng_Latn but now a days, by a better nomenclature, 'of all the saints,
eng_Latn touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars.
eng_Latn which was admirably arranged for sleeping in
eng_Latn but I've got a good place.
eng_Latn it has the might to do so and therefore the right.
eng_Latn for it isan error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural.
eng_Latn before the horror was half an hour old
eng_Latn it was the best day any of them could remember since the superflu had drawn away
eng_Latn then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.
eng_Latn but the only bounds one side of my cell
eng_Latn which I would gladly have enjoyed longer
eng_Latn whose wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to observe.
eng_Latn I did not come this way,' I said.
eng_Latn but, happily for me, he can dispense with it
eng_Latn I coulda chucked my job
eng_Latn visit uninhabited territories
eng_Latn I know. I do know.
eng_Latn but these did not impress him.
eng_Latn I was his first admirer in the islands.
eng_Latn catching at the undertaker's coat, as he once more moved towards the door.
eng_Latn I know I don't have to.
eng_Latn he told her he loved her devotedly
eng_Latn she had very early made up her mind to his incapacity of minding his own interests
eng_Latn I shall tell you once we've finished checking it.
eng_Latn underneath the lantern in a littleiron box
eng_Latn smiling at him with the peculiar tenderness women save for the most beloved men in their lives.
eng_Latn if you're here when I come tomorra, I'll run ya in.
eng_Latn thrust two fingers under the peak of his cap
eng_Latn so that the whole thing turned out to be an illusion on her part.
eng_Latn Hello. I am Dog and this is Pug.You must be the Magic Pencil.
eng_Latn I shattered a window in the back door with a brick
eng_Latn until he passed a group of them next to the bakers.
eng_Latn so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as thefirst.
eng_Latn which had been popularized by sentimental and virtuous biographies.
eng_Latn which will probably be the case, for I have no anxiety to raise slips of myself here
eng_Latn his rifle close by his right hand.
eng_Latn I shook my head.
eng_Latn then landed on cold, damp earth.
eng_Latn I must speak.
eng_Latn find and use the magnificent loving power within you.
eng_Latn although he still did not realise this himself.
eng_Latn a brown envelope that looked like a bill
eng_Latn I thought, as I stood there, wondering which way to turn
eng_Latn I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm.
eng_Latn but on moving towards the whist tables
eng_Latn for her mind was busy planning.
eng_Latn with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey ofpartridges.
eng_Latn I must tell her first, and alone.
eng_Latn than a ruse or lovelorn device
eng_Latn as he worked toward the center of the log the axe head disappeared entirely inside the cut
eng_Latn I've guessed let's have the secret!
eng_Latn at least he was there in time
eng_Latn it was not a bad one in itself.
eng_Latn she thought and desperation came back to her.
eng_Latn extorting almost as much outward homage
eng_Latn I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.
eng_Latn which was his only chance to speak to her
eng_Latn your attitude to me.
eng_Latn since he was no longer in terror for himself.
eng_Latn put the cup down empty.
eng_Latn yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon
eng_Latn before I began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of clock work contrived by some ingenious artist.
eng_Latn I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.
eng_Latn nor any hair at all on their buttocks, except about the anus
eng_Latn to saddle them
eng_Latn quickly busied himself with the marmalade.
eng_Latn brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven.
eng_Latn the wretchedness of an old man interests no one.
eng_Latn Hello, Goldilocks!
eng_Latn I was not able to do till three days after.
eng_Latn Ooh ..Best . Day. Ever!
eng_Latn it was enough that I had something to eat and a bed to lie on.
eng_Latn barely permitted her to make out the shape of things
eng_Latn I think you will find I tasteextremely un-leafy .
eng_Latn he's an internationally famous wizard already!
eng_Latn which was so little perceptible to a common observer
eng_Latn then to signify the great lenity and favour of his majesty and council
eng_Latn he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out.
eng_Latn Don t forget the doggy biscuits....
eng_Latn I will explain everything to you in amoment.
eng_Latn Another wonderful question Pug. I think I shall meditate on it.
eng_Latn I thought would have made me faint.
eng_Latn but don't call him so, he will be offended.
eng_Latn for I now began to be tortured with thirst.
eng_Latn instead of leaving the door fastened
eng_Latn but I'm damned if I sympathize.
eng_Latn I tried to look as though, to my mind, there was nothing worse in the world than that.
eng_Latn her head covered
eng_Latn for nearly an hour to get up a head of steam, while an officers' patrol came back and searched, very carefully, the ground where I had been seen sitting.
eng_Latn because nature, in that country, observing the same proportion through all her operations.
eng_Latn you know how susceptible and esthetically impressionable I am.
eng_Latn that if she revealed my negligence of his orders
eng_Latn I can't tell any more than you,' he said.
eng_Latn whereupon the studio manager said
eng_Latn because I think it is nice to be engaged.
eng_Latn slylyand silently remained as near as possible to watch.
eng_Latn I never seemed to get the chance.
eng_Latn the letters have not yet been forwarded
eng_Latn for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is.
eng_Latn I'm afraid we didn t bring any swabs with us.
eng_Latn she insisted, laughing
eng_Latn so that she could sit down on the end of bed
eng_Latn I love her exceedingly, and am delighted to find that you like her too.
eng_Latn follow with the things and now slipping in the mud
eng_Latn leaning back he drew several deep breaths.
eng_Latn these noises meant no more than the chiming of a dull clock in the distance, marking the hours of the night.
eng_Latn We don t want to scare them away.
eng_Latn I will acknowledge the issue decided.
eng_Latn next, he had much lesswork, since it was shared.
eng_Latn in fact, the place of honour at the top left hand corner of the front page.
eng_Latn who were standing nervously at the counter that ran all along the great marble hall
eng_Latn The dinosaurs have been down here so long they ve evolved!
eng_Latn Yes! It's a new world record!
eng_Latn I put on my smile again.
eng_Latn let me end on that which is most important
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all..
eng_Latn which exactly suited me.
eng_Latn I saw something that almost made me jump out of my skin.
eng_Latn I agree with you that this is a peculiar occasion
eng_Latn I remember that on my first morning I awoke early
eng_Latn Now I have had a little peace Pug, I'm in a much better mood to make some noise!
eng_Latn at that very moment, or it would be too late.
eng_Latn his eyes closed.
eng_Latn from whom he has received no obligation
eng_Latn dark haired, lanky, bent over a book
eng_Latn waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.
eng_Latn I scanned the screen in my peripheral vision.
eng_Latn very pretty and very silly.
eng_Latn with a familiarity that cut him to the quick because his boldness came too late.
eng_Latn That s because I found your comicin my book Pug.
eng_Latn so I just made a little private moan for my one beauty.
eng_Latn where she now stood looking at him
eng_Latn Are you alright Mr Donkey Derby?
eng_Latn had already advised the young man of a temporary remedy.
eng_Latn but I'll need your testimony.
eng_Latn she in turn stood staring down at him
eng_Latn knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town
eng_Latn between the madness of women andthe madness of men.
eng_Latn he hadn't spoken clearly enough
eng_Latn it did me good!
eng_Latn purring so loudly that everyone laughed.
eng_Latn remembered the child.
eng_Latn a sufficiency of cold water
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.
eng_Latn but somehow it seems as if I did.
eng_Latn his wounded arm forgotten, thoughts of suicide forgotten.
eng_Latn that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.
eng_Latn I shall be ready to go tomorrow,' he said.
eng_Latn though they were still there.
eng_Latn as the fellow may put out his light and be off.
eng_Latn I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met as I was warned I should this comrade.
eng_Latn no good would come of it.
eng_Latn I have it from good authority that last night and a pretty night it was!
eng_Latn it was beating her wings wildly against the bars of her cage.
eng_Latn I can safely take satisfaction for the affront he has offered me
eng_Latn so that by simply turning her head she could look out across the lawns.
eng_Latn she had no ear
eng_Latn a nose that was flat as a snakes with slits for nostrils
eng_Latn but you need more than a nice guy.
eng_Latn The End.
eng_Latn so I was a good long time in getting over.
eng_Latn I shall be very sorry to lose him next year,
eng_Latn she said shortly, not even troubling to blush at his implication.
eng_Latn but I guess it's a bit late for warnings like that.
eng_Latn whom he had met by the way
eng_Latn as for instance, if a _Houyhnhnm_ has two males
eng_Latn but never daring to go beyond her.
eng_Latn To the wheelie ladder Dog?
eng_Latn I caught glimpses of a battle with forces greater than our own.
eng_Latn for they all realized what that meant.
eng_Latn this grave, and to reach the gate in season topass it before it is shut.
eng_Latn restored the usual hand to his mouth.
eng_Latn I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife.
eng_Latn I have a solution ready
eng_Latn Puggle-Wuggle. Puggle-Wuggle.Puggle-W...
eng_Latn he continued, as they turned towards the house.
eng_Latn she loved him
eng_Latn I'll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me
eng_Latn that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions.
eng_Latn but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded.
eng_Latn Oh. That would be wonderful Dog and Pug. She s over there.
eng_Latn and this scene was premeditated
eng_Latn killin' and a lot of us was kilt.
eng_Latn what they were like
eng_Latn perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life.
eng_Latn had very little to do with reality.
eng_Latn struck at its straining head and slashed at its moving feet.
eng_Latn I myself could have done no better.
eng_Latn cleared it at a bound, and was gone.
eng_Latn I am Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn his eyes on the dark doorway to the hospital wing
eng_Latn hundreds of homes resounding with their footsteps.
eng_Latn I have advised him to do that.
eng_Latn I ain't seen him since he was little.
eng_Latn pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.
eng_Latn while she went somewhere upon business, or a visit.
eng_Latn I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries
eng_Latn Would you like to take my factorytour? It's about to start.
eng_Latn till they have swallowed it and got the colic.
eng_Latn I hope we shall have you with us for a long time yet.
eng_Latn I mean, he gave away all your secrets.
eng_Latn I just have to figure out how to use it.
eng_Latn I leaped nimbly from the branch to his side, soundlessly landing again on the balls of my feet.
eng_Latn here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!
eng_Latn a pity but I am in a situation now where I am forced to sell it.
eng_Latn but she didn't mention anything about this rule changing.
eng_Latn I have absolutely no idea, Pug ...but something smells fishy.
eng_Latn had his meals as usual
eng_Latn You know it wasn t just kites that The Chinese invented.
eng_Latn I'll tell you from the beginning.
eng_Latn had she deemed it possible enough for wishing.
eng_Latn by the cursed advice he gave my master, to show me as a sight upon a market day in the next town, which was half an hour's riding, about two and twenty miles from our house.
eng_Latn to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade
eng_Latn knowing that she didnot want to be noticed.
eng_Latn the game ended in complete confusion.
eng_Latn capable of healing anything from a rent in the side of a work dog to an ulcer on a human shin.
eng_Latn for sure I dare say
eng_Latn anything else she had done.
eng_Latn but he's one of our side
eng_Latn he answered, frowning.
eng_Latn he said mournfully.
eng_Latn there miserably howled
eng_Latn one of them with a red cap
eng_Latn she thanked him with an inclination of the head, and began smelling her bouquet.
eng_Latn a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.
eng_Latn one good idea is all you need to start a fortune.
eng_Latn the bearing of his deeds a matter of private vision adjusted solely by spiritual relations and conceptions of the divine purposes.
eng_Latn apropos, what is become of him?
eng_Latn scratched, and bleeding hands.
eng_Latn but only once or twice in a hundred years.
eng_Latn these moments were but presentiments, as it were, of the one final second
eng_Latn neither of the two took much heed of her.
eng_Latn our folks had paid good solid money for it
eng_Latn it was to pin down some thought more exactly.
eng_Latn she braided her long hair
eng_Latn if they got me some electricity to run it.
eng_Latn from its craggy summit I looked out myself across the melancholy downs.
eng_Latn You kept saying Hey and lots of diddles.
eng_Latn then moved back to her place without looking at him.
eng_Latn on the first occasion of my sitting up in the evening
eng_Latn haven't the faintest idea what there is for them to express their will about.
eng_Latn that he was condescending when he noticed them at all.
eng_Latn sat at a distance under the verandah.
eng_Latn I put on the sun bonnet and tied it under my chin
eng_Latn you can take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket.
eng_Latn go right again as soon as possible.
eng_Latn the party had the intention of rifling his room that night.
eng_Latn he was leaning over her to turn the leaves.
eng_Latn I would not be bound to go two miles in it for fifty thousand pounds.
eng_Latn so that at first I was not quite sure
eng_Latn ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed
eng_Latn the man asked if he could be moved next to the window.
eng_Latn the life of knights errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses
eng_Latn I completely messed up
eng_Latn but the form of it was unexpected, and particularly disagreeable to him.
eng_Latn but now there was only silence and the wind.
eng_Latn for there was no one the man in the flat in the 11th arrondissement hated more.
eng_Latn I put them both outside my door last night
eng_Latn for his madness is amusing
eng_Latn I trailed you to the cave, but didn't follow you down
eng_Latn his lips were smiling.
eng_Latn I glanced at the angry mob, too
eng_Latn it is quite ridiculous for a young lady of fashion
eng_Latn he folded the letter and resumed his pensive attitude.
eng_Latn let me end on that which is most important
eng_Latn pausing as he was about to read the remainder of the novel.
eng_Latn when he was already stamped with the mark of death.
eng_Latn I jumped after him.
eng_Latn at night, the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe.
eng_Latn which makes this day's news doubly welcome.
eng_Latn thence turned to the left
eng_Latn Oh Obviously not a music lover.
eng_Latn he followed him quietly to the table
eng_Latn here or some where and tell him all and get him to say how really guilty
eng_Latn I could not doubt that
eng_Latn converse once more with those dear to his heart.
eng_Latn the others were only reflections of that living fire of goodness and love.
eng_Latn till he had first defended that attack.
eng_Latn I listened, too engrossed, to the girl's response.
eng_Latn I took up the vessel with much difficulty in both hands.
eng_Latn there was much in his life which was strange and terrible, in his character something outrageous, and in his fate not a little that was pathetic.
eng_Latn I understand, of course, that you consider it necessary.
eng_Latn take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that 'ere dog.
eng_Latn as he attempted to do one rainy morning
eng_Latn Well I remember that autumn when a great fog descended on London...
eng_Latn my fingers large and chunky in comparison to hers.
eng_Latn speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment.
eng_Latn I have to say it
eng_Latn we'll pick a lop management team to back him up.
eng_Latn I'm no labor agitator!
eng_Latn as well as other maims and hurts in the several parts of the body.
eng_Latn I shall have to teach her first how to study
eng_Latn I really felt something of the emotion that had caught him.
eng_Latn with the great yellowy white walls of abandoned convents behind the rows of sombre green cypresses, that fact very modern in its spirit
eng_Latn that had never happened before.
eng_Latn just after I was born
eng_Latn congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade.
eng_Latn I and my life are like a young man and his betrothed.
eng_Latn when I heard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door.
eng_Latn I missed it right after we got into the wood.
eng_Latn I jus' don't know what the country's comin' to.
eng_Latn with his sport shirt which looked like a hospital jacket
eng_Latn he was still in want of quiet.
eng_Latn it has in it a certain diffidence.
eng_Latn Now they re making tents out of books so they can holiday at home!
eng_Latn Or stolen by the Lost Sock Monster.
eng_Latn For all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players.
eng_Latn smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before
eng_Latn But there was no one there.
eng_Latn I must keep her near me.
eng_Latn No. It's a safety net to catch us if we fall.
eng_Latn for to gain you would be life to me
eng_Latn that was the state of the case!
eng_Latn I enjoyed it much.
eng_Latn And any minute now a young girlcalled Goldilocks will come skipping along.
eng_Latn just like he'd always guarded me.
eng_Latn following hard upon the footsteps of our friend.
eng_Latn would also have the property qualification for doing so.
eng_Latn that wouldn't do he wanted it with him where he could look at it
eng_Latn disappeared deftly into the angriness around him.
eng_Latn but it was quickly getting over that
eng_Latn the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.
eng_Latn I am here to accuse him, but to defend him also.
eng_Latn but I'm hard to impress right now.
eng_Latn the shrinking room which was so eminently distasteful to him
eng_Latn I never made any fuss about the young fellow.
eng_Latn I leant back in my chair
eng_Latn the carpenter here can arrange it easily.
eng_Latn I threw the sketches into the waste paper basket in disgust, thinking no more about them.
eng_Latn I wasn't very good at it.
eng_Latn Welcome fellow explorers. We are about to go on a voyage of discovery - underground!
eng_Latn I wish he had made his coffin
eng_Latn I look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look at.
eng_Latn nobody knew whose baby it was
eng_Latn this time he stood over it a little while
eng_Latn he took his tea in silence.
eng_Latn instantly changing the mood in the kitchen.
eng_Latn then, as an honest man, you cannot help caring about it and sympathizing with the movement, and so wishing to work for it.
eng_Latn if he'd knowed how to work spunk water
eng_Latn but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these.
eng_Latn therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your brother's account.
eng_Latn suddenly he felt something long and hairy
eng_Latn because she had rarely slept alone in that bed since the loss of her virginity.
eng_Latn your father, should take his departure for the other world
eng_Latn if he be a sensible man
eng_Latn Umm. Arbitrage....Fuselage..Aah..Camouflage
eng_Latn but he might be rendered unhappy
eng_Latn I had something to do.
eng_Latn to place the hat on his head.
eng_Latn he wasone who, out of many in this northern region, had been touched
eng_Latn then he let him go, and proceeded to fine each of the girls five dollars
eng_Latn called to him to stop, that she might kiss me once more.
eng_Latn Ah. Oh.I think it's over here.
eng_Latn much less properly spoken with him.
eng_Latn I shall be sure to find employment
eng_Latn who, merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a side pocket of his great coat
eng_Latn once more flying
eng_Latn the equally unseasonable impulse to burst into scornful invective.
eng_Latn while dreading the blow
eng_Latn but these words produced no effect on him.
eng_Latn in law the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them
eng_Latn it was one of his accomplishments to speak with fluency.
eng_Latn I am very glad you were well enough and I hope you had a pleasant party
eng_Latn I smiled ruefully.
eng_Latn I am one of the principal characters of the play
eng_Latn I'm heartily glad you have come and are staying with me.
eng_Latn whether knights errant deserve to be held in estimation,
eng_Latn but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself
eng_Latn this is the kitchen
eng_Latn but he had really never been.
eng_Latn I am not going anywhere,
eng_Latn leaving the consequence to fortune.
eng_Latn then borne forward with prodigious speed.
eng_Latn when they dare creep back in at midnight and make themselves a hot chocolate.
eng_Latn it fed the malevolence with which they regarded their neighbors.
eng_Latn I don't even dispute it.
eng_Latn I stretched my neck eagerly to look for the place where I had sat, in the sun and in the shade, waiting for my money.
eng_Latn he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen.
eng_Latn she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it
eng_Latn When I ve built it's bigger brain it won t be a mere machine like Dogstar One.
eng_Latn was a glad piece of news
eng_Latn making the odour exhale, and scumming off the saliva.
eng_Latn have others be nice to him, too.
eng_Latn It helps me be a bit bolder.
eng_Latn I was not fifteen when my father found that I had a lover,
eng_Latn it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing
eng_Latn then, in the space of three seconds and a half, everything had changed
eng_Latn but he held her hand.
eng_Latn dashed back downstairs to his trunk
eng_Latn but he had gone too far to draw back
eng_Latn but only as she had imagined it before she had been there.
eng_Latn but I would have nothing to do with it.
eng_Latn I have to thank her for this sprain.
eng_Latn but the renegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his life.
eng_Latn I love the sound of them.
eng_Latn I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it.
eng_Latn she noticed with joy that it was one of her good days, and that she was in complete possession of all her forces
eng_Latn turned a deaf ear to her pleas
eng_Latn now stood thereunable for the moment to think of anything more to say.
eng_Latn There is also a princess called Thisbee.
eng_Latn he had become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few
eng_Latn I can see of the line.
eng_Latn I as good as killed them
eng_Latn so deep it had cracked the sewer below.
eng_Latn I'm not going to mention any names.
eng_Latn it was like a fresh slap in the face.
eng_Latn to be my second self, and best earthly companion.
eng_Latn I've run quite out of it.
eng_Latn but a number of men had already made their way in, and met him.
eng_Latn I mean to go into all that.
eng_Latn Oh, I can deal with them.
eng_Latn What pole?
eng_Latn was lying stretched before us.
eng_Latn so that he would help him start the total war.
eng_Latn although in the last days he lost his appetite
eng_Latn I turned back to the front door, which I'd left open
eng_Latn he had shrunk with proud sensitiveness from ever recurring to the subject.
eng_Latn where the provisions looked so splendid and clean
eng_Latn burst with our buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup.
eng_Latn I think the right breast is very well painted.
eng_Latn was no roof at all.
eng_Latn I says, that's what you get for narking ME!
eng_Latn I never much believed in neither of THEM.
eng_Latn I couldn t tell the upper world even if I wanted to. Our cave has collapsed. There s no way home.
eng_Latn having behind it the village, and in front of it theslope, which was tolerably steep then.
eng_Latn I crawled up from the floor
eng_Latn you'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone.
eng_Latn they are first rate, these people, at making a career!
eng_Latn I hope it all went off tolerably well.
eng_Latn boasted to him of her winnings
eng_Latn almost before I realize what's happening.
eng_Latn wiping he waited.
eng_Latn along the road, in the snow, the silence and the night, under the cold stars.
eng_Latn but ashamed of making a pretense, she looked straight in his face with cold eyes.
eng_Latn even if her last haircut was a bit severe.
eng_Latn that his brother had a littledaughter whom he would bring with him
eng_Latn hear me out!
eng_Latn he ought to be accustomed by now to making at first sight a bad impression on people.
eng_Latn Treasury Island.
eng_Latn I was left a prisoner in his power
eng_Latn stopping obligingly before every cluster of huts to collect produce, down to three pound parcels of indiarubber bound in a wrapper of dry grass.
eng_Latn Those are hieroglyphics.
eng_Latn pushing it away when it got too inquisitive.
eng_Latn where I have a villa on the sea.
eng_Latn but without the success she had at first hopedfor.
eng_Latn I can remember it vividly now
eng_Latn as if she had just fished them out of a pond.
eng_Latn but now knit his brows and nodded his head slowly
eng_Latn some particulars connected with the public safety
eng_Latn neutralized the effects of the poison?
eng_Latn everybody got bills at the grocery.
eng_Latn but I awoke next morning after nine o'clock when they knocked at my door.
eng_Latn but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely
eng_Latn I can stay in town and see to the selling while they handle the milling and hauling.
eng_Latn sat knitting what looked like a canary yellow circus tent.
eng_Latn pick off another man.
eng_Latn you talked to her and amused her a long time.
eng_Latn enabled me to fix the date.
eng_Latn I will write, what I enjoy writing
eng_Latn she reckons we've got to find treasure.
eng_Latn It's a Factoid Pug. They put new facts in boxes when they arrive at the Wherehouse.
eng_Latn one of the partners in the highly respectable firm.
eng_Latn while his is waning and waning, and that's why we're drifting apart.
eng_Latn the lady, getting up from the ground, saved him the trouble
eng_Latn I tried again.
eng_Latn her mother answered with a wave of her whip.
eng_Latn not looking where she was going
eng_Latn she hurried into the room alone
eng_Latn cried the young girl
eng_Latn I only need one man to swim the creek with me.
eng_Latn made a mouth at him
eng_Latn g and looked hard at me.
eng_Latn I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting
eng_Latn Well, I ve always been known for my innovative recipes...
eng_Latn put GBP300 on one side for the air fare and expenses the following day
eng_Latn as an unqualified fact because no one shared her doubts.
eng_Latn two large sheets of note paper were covered with very small handwriting.
eng_Latn It's a you and me Dog!
eng_Latn you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
eng_Latn a bottle of wine, and two glasses
eng_Latn she cried again, losing her temper and stamping her foot.
eng_Latn I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty.
eng_Latn from the first I just felt that she was made for me
eng_Latn but they have been that way always.
eng_Latn following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach.
eng_Latn during which time, the emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.
eng_Latn went after the innkeeper in the dark
eng_Latn but that beautiful black hair
eng_Latn but we seldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred.
eng_Latn I may count on you
eng_Latn put his legs out of the window
eng_Latn it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners
eng_Latn to enjoy the sport of the search.
eng_Latn perhaps to acquire others
eng_Latn like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again.
eng_Latn I think the pencil s noticed we ve gone Dog.
eng_Latn Dog loves…
eng_Latn I tried to forget everything else so I could concentrate.
eng_Latn then strode swiftly across to the table
eng_Latn I apologise if I seemed critical.
eng_Latn the commanding officer had orders to convey me safe thither
eng_Latn I pressed forward towards the middle of the room until I had secured a seat at a croupier's elbow.
eng_Latn I'll pull off his cassock,
eng_Latn time, when everything would be made free
eng_Latn he said I must make a finished picture of it.
eng_Latn I heard more of that than the lecture in my own class.
eng_Latn Sorry! Must dash!
eng_Latn the new sun in her firmament.
eng_Latn too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear.
eng_Latn the man on the floor cried suddenly, and then was silent.
eng_Latn reached the brim like a well filled bushel of barley.
eng_Latn omething rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us.
eng_Latn after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep
eng_Latn I may count on you
eng_Latn that is why people object to it.
eng_Latn I love books that ask big questions like...
eng_Latn I hope you enjoyed your voyage to the stars, and remember, anytime you want to visit them again, all you have to do is look up into the night sky - and wonder.
eng_Latn without first wandering in this manner
eng_Latn he leaped from his bed
eng_Latn was that he had presented a neat and pleasing appearance.
eng_Latn one near the bottom, one by the top.
eng_Latn this one will be turned into cash to day.
eng_Latn whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war.
eng_Latn trying to summon anger to her aid
eng_Latn she raised one hand as if in protest.
eng_Latn it will bring bad luck.
eng_Latn That. D-dogs and bats!
eng_Latn I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town.
eng_Latn induces me to hope
eng_Latn I didn't altogether see why it was of course
eng_Latn I congratulate you.
eng_Latn the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment.
eng_Latn but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy.
eng_Latn I feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which I had found him at the solitary fireside.
eng_Latn because his life did not belong to him
eng_Latn if anything, she proposed to permit herself to do in regard to him.
eng_Latn a few lines at the same time by the post
eng_Latn nothing as yet.
eng_Latn when the boarders trooped into the dining room for breakfast
eng_Latn starbursts of gunshot wounds
eng_Latn but I gave them very little satisfaction
eng_Latn that there was no way this man could be persuaded to do anything he did not want to do.
eng_Latn I want to help you.
eng_Latn he pulled out his wand and limped off into the forest.
eng_Latn I will fear no evil, he said into the dead silence of the cellblock wing, and he liked the way it sounded.
eng_Latn had been sleeping for several months in its bed of manure.
eng_Latn I had not very much to say.
eng_Latn for as to capering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant.
eng_Latn if his masters present him with clothes
eng_Latn whether he had taught himself to sublimate his passions almost perfectly
eng_Latn I can see a red page one!
eng_Latn though o'course about five miles to the west o' here is the railroad.
eng_Latn we shall be glad for you to stop as long as you like.
eng_Latn it had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries.
eng_Latn I'm afraid I don't see any point in troubling them further.
eng_Latn with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday
eng_Latn the pallor and anguish expressed on his countenance
eng_Latn I want to open my heart before you, so that you may see how I wish your welfare.
eng_Latn or perhaps worse!
eng_Latn then the brother, he, who had appeared so attached to you!
eng_Latn she hastily disengaged herself
eng_Latn showed me into a small, tidy, carpeted apartment
eng_Latn I felt sure you'd like to have the latest news of her.
eng_Latn it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket.
eng_Latn a jug of iced pumpkin juice
eng_Latn but he's anxious to have the stone.
eng_Latn finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son.
eng_Latn there's enough of that sort of talk.
eng_Latn he left his station by the pilot and hat in hand leaned over the ship's bulwarks
eng_Latn I have oil if you want to oil them Dog. I'm trying to get a sun tan.
eng_Latn I can feel my face growing hotter and hotter.
eng_Latn would not be hindered from immediately going to see it
eng_Latn he had to go around like that for a week.
eng_Latn What a clever idea.
eng_Latn ever more absolutely bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh.
eng_Latn I could teach him more.
eng_Latn but I'm afraid I should not be able to do that very well either.
eng_Latn some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me
eng_Latn so his self respect is greater than his thirst for money.
eng_Latn Yes
eng_Latn I hurried out in a foolish state of dread
eng_Latn he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing
eng_Latn you slug hell out of them
eng_Latn he had lost his only weapon.
eng_Latn I am not going anywhere,
eng_Latn I believe, however, in keeping the best to the last.
eng_Latn once or twice shook his head in strong dissent.
eng_Latn Oh Ho That s easy!
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder, Dog?
eng_Latn I had not got three yards from the door, when he came after me
eng_Latn old men are always so selfish in their affection
eng_Latn that the red glare was the nursery fire.
eng_Latn for which I had a warrant.
eng_Latn I can't afford to care now.
eng_Latn she is old enough to know what she is about
eng_Latn I must know from first handall there is to know.
eng_Latn she could not get the thought of her out of her mind that afternoon
eng_Latn or else she will be sick, only to grieve us.
eng_Latn that were never said of me
eng_Latn I shall be about to have been studying it.
eng_Latn they have to carry that attitude out into the street with them.
eng_Latn tell them what he had seen in that hell down there.
eng_Latn those I have been dozing and grumbling away at the play.
eng_Latn Exploring a cave ... Catching awave ..Ah.. Being brave!
eng_Latn she soon dropped off.
eng_Latn dwell upon memories of the past.
eng_Latn for a short, plump, kind faced woman
eng_Latn that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment
eng_Latn I'm too ancient for this!
eng_Latn pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.
eng_Latn we call ourselves vegetarians, our little inside joke.
eng_Latn I had no hesitation in advising him to marry.
eng_Latn there was a difference due to their alarm and shock at what had happened that afternoon.
eng_Latn not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present.
eng_Latn We will go and get everything needed to mend this bridge.
eng_Latn Dog, the naughty bookshop mice keep laughing at me.
eng_Latn the sea breeze had set in higher than usual.
eng_Latn yet that you should fall into a delusion so great
eng_Latn all the daimons struggling within him, all of whom had an equal right to live.
eng_Latn entered the tunnel again flung off his rags and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead body had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside
eng_Latn I didn' wanta stop there, fear we wouldn' get acrost.
eng_Latn almost a whole second had passed since I'd been on the table.
eng_Latn for my mother wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now.
eng_Latn the irons, the irons!
eng_Latn when he come to this country and was pore, that didn't scare him a mite neither.
eng_Latn had arrived there by scaling the wall
eng_Latn that they bear to all others of the same species who come in their way
eng_Latn such is my fate and I am a beast by nature!
eng_Latn if he didn't save it wi' clemmin' his own inside.
eng_Latn her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl
eng_Latn an orc shot him from behind a stone.
eng_Latn no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me.
eng_Latn but it may be that in private she had a copious conversation.
eng_Latn issued a report saying that the effects of the bomb were 'disappointing'.
eng_Latn was much fatigued and in a very weak state of health.
eng_Latn you may lay to that.
eng_Latn or the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not well
eng_Latn her mouth stretched too tightly for speech
eng_Latn I wondered if the bishop's wife saw the flush on my face
eng_Latn proposed that my pocket handkerchief should be spread upon the horse's back to dry.
eng_Latn because he was a man apart.
eng_Latn I could break a hoof trying to get over that.
eng_Latn I couldn't repeat them.
eng_Latn That s it, Dog! Keep going!
eng_Latn it wasn't hard.
eng_Latn with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection.
eng_Latn never knowing he suffered.
eng_Latn How curious. Now I can hear agrumbling, rumbling...
eng_Latn but the hum of the heater was the real soundtrack.
eng_Latn between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.
eng_Latn wind or no wind.
eng_Latn but making sure we take things very carefully all the time.
eng_Latn give the public some really helpful and constructive news instead of all these murders and divorces.
eng_Latn jumped for the dead man's shoulders.
eng_Latn which fell over the garden like an immenseblack pall.
eng_Latn but that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to avoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals,
eng_Latn I will use my favourite colouring pencils.
eng_Latn was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.
eng_Latn Welcome to puzzle two. There arelots of things here, but can you find five pairs?
eng_Latn caught up what arms they had
eng_Latn she ended up by consoling herself with her own lies.
eng_Latn that moved through the house and was extinguished, a little after nine, in the bedroom with the balcony.
eng_Latn he cried shrilly.
eng_Latn surrounded by beautiful paintings and antiques.
eng_Latn marry me now.
eng_Latn your sister thinks so as well as I.
eng_Latn Mmm, it's IS nearly their bedtime.Perhaps we have a book in the shop that might help.
eng_Latn at last she was free.
eng_Latn I can't do just as I want to here.
eng_Latn has been scientifically tested and measured since the 1980s and,
eng_Latn though she had watched him change and grow with proprietary pride
eng_Latn they were like schoolboys after a few hours in school.
eng_Latn squirted boiling tea all over the place
eng_Latn I think it's time for you to meet them.
eng_Latn about six hundred feet high.
eng_Latn half of 'em like to drowned.
eng_Latn though now and again he remembered my existence and flung me a remark at hazard.
eng_Latn the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor.
eng_Latn he would say no word that might disturb her peace or spoil her tranquil sense of comradeship.
eng_Latn with her needle drawn out to its thread's length.
eng_Latn a real one, but that they would talk of that later.
eng_Latn during which I will be with you to introduce you to those who are my friends.
eng_Latn said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready.
eng_Latn I hated thinking of her that way
eng_Latn there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be acquired
eng_Latn he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage.
eng_Latn Who s a pretty pirate?
eng_Latn the skin was white and clear.
eng_Latn It was you all the time???!!!
eng_Latn professing he would be glad to receive further information.
eng_Latn the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.
eng_Latn not offer to walk, or lie down, in a meadow or field of corn.
eng_Latn don't interrupt the bachelor
eng_Latn not only his own money, but that of his clients as well.
eng_Latn no one will believe it.
eng_Latn while here are we trying to drag out our meal as long as possible,
eng_Latn but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince's favorite topic
eng_Latn more than anything else, it troubled and irritated him.
eng_Latn being always provided with a good number of books.
eng_Latn now put into repair and turned into a modern dwelling.
eng_Latn as an unqualified fact because no one shared her doubts.
eng_Latn that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife
eng_Latn I've got a treat for you after supper.
eng_Latn Soggier DogBiscuits.
eng_Latn as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story.
eng_Latn I didn t make a snow...
eng_Latn I hate maroon
eng_Latn he gave me a lift homeward.
eng_Latn to the force of things become the sole public force
eng_Latn I looked at her again
eng_Latn with his handkerchief rubbed his trouser knees,green with juicy grass.
eng_Latn I've held it in check so far.
eng_Latn he could not stop himself flinching, suppress the exclamation of pain.
eng_Latn I wisht I had five hundred jalopies.
eng_Latn I'll tell you my idea after.
eng_Latn she searched for him where he was not, she searched again without hope, and she found him
eng_Latn on my account!
eng_Latn yet should understand how things stood between them.
eng_Latn the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow.
eng_Latn stroking me gently with the other.
eng_Latn now your whole fortune, in a chest concealed under that closet
eng_Latn his serfs, or himself, only one ought to
eng_Latn but he shook his head and said it was for me.
eng_Latn the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be
eng_Latn ...I love books that help me relax with a nice calming...
eng_Latn watching his mother, father, sister, and friends murdered.
eng_Latn he shuddered all over with a cold shiver.
eng_Latn it is far better to be feared than loved
eng_Latn already it was impossible to say which was which.
eng_Latn panting from the effort of dragging his trunk.
eng_Latn but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform.
eng_Latn she thought she would have to go down again, brave the throng about the desk.
eng_Latn hoisted the sack of fish over her shoulder
eng_Latn that could endanger the stability of his marriage.
eng_Latn to get our cannon out.
eng_Latn begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.
eng_Latn but it was evident that he hated him and all his party
eng_Latn I know the tune for him.
eng_Latn so deep it had cracked the sewer below.
eng_Latn I don't want your advice.
eng_Latn you might have a bit of difficulty in believing I ever belonged to it.
eng_Latn for all I care about is to get my money.
eng_Latn I don't believe you!
eng_Latn I sat there in my corner
eng_Latn fear you get praying over me.
eng_Latn I never saw you for an instant.
eng_Latn especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning
eng_Latn to whom I shall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay
eng_Latn she tried to feel an interest in her own amendment
eng_Latn be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.
eng_Latn bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a deep sigh.
eng_Latn they re mained in the road below him.
eng_Latn after an hour they told each other all their secrets.
eng_Latn I couldn't remember the last time she'd looked so excited to see me.
eng_Latn take her out of the stubble
eng_Latn he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects.
eng_Latn But you only have five minutes tofind the piece or you ll end up in the next show!
eng_Latn better than from the lighthouse
eng_Latn when he did open his mouth, it was to utter the falsehood that I had occasioned the uproar
eng_Latn will certainly bespeak the favour of the bench.
eng_Latn the reasons why he had declined them.
eng_Latn ears on her head, which had real hair and enamel eyes.
eng_Latn but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband.
eng_Latn both my father and grandfather died of it in a third attack
eng_Latn I was never consulted.
eng_Latn peeping as usual and our timorous lips more or less under anxious control.
eng_Latn but and always will be, pseudo healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths.
eng_Latn expecting every moment that the coast guard would be down upon us.
eng_Latn Chien and Pug, you have caught me.But before you hand me over to Billy Barker, please look in here.
eng_Latn gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives.
eng_Latn his pulse imperceptibly stopped and his soul departed.
eng_Latn but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally
eng_Latn that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish.
eng_Latn I desired them to tell me what country it was.
eng_Latn it was the way you
eng_Latn than a ruse or lovelorn device
eng_Latn this morning I came across two sparrows fighting
eng_Latn I'm trying to stay outside the loop.
eng_Latn she is so very unreasonable.
eng_Latn that son who had first learned to say pear and then granny
eng_Latn but the count seized his arm and prevented hiM
eng_Latn a love new to her, before he was born.
eng_Latn in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away the bald head.
eng_Latn then I've found him and I want to go to bed with him.
eng_Latn spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it.
eng_Latn the hide merchant and his servants had seen three men on the road arrested suspiciously, with their horses' heads together.
eng_Latn To find out what the Wumpus is.
eng_Latn but then it had to be done only once.
eng_Latn just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood would suit him to live in.
eng_Latn of being starved by a gradual process in the house
eng_Latn his rifle close by his right hand.
eng_Latn it became entangled, fell face forward, and
eng_Latn Ready?
eng_Latn The general's demeanour was pleasant the whole time, and Catherine was relieved of the general's hopes and aspirations.
eng_Latn my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil
eng_Latn maybe four or five years.
eng_Latn to know who was the sponsor of that uncommon tribute.
eng_Latn but it is the artist's business to create sunshine when the sun fails.
eng_Latn she'd have thought it vaguely wicked sort of decadent and foreign and aristocratic to keep later hours.
eng_Latn he swallowed half of it.
eng_Latn although I did not much admire the conceit.
eng_Latn he's a tough old fellow.
eng_Latn to be noticed and admired.
eng_Latn I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before you
eng_Latn his thirst for vengeance was all that had sustained him, kept him alive.
eng_Latn may not be said and heard again to morrow.
eng_Latn soul and senses quivering with keen throes
eng_Latn but, so armed, he was stronger than his namesake, and blinder
eng_Latn as though he'd only just realized he was there.
eng_Latn the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all...
eng_Latn I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug.
eng_Latn such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way
eng_Latn since they are by no means incompatible emotions.
eng_Latn it's pretty important.
eng_Latn perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting three hundred million people all with the same face.
eng_Latn what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first.
eng_Latn I hear her strange heart, he murmured with an almost musical lilt to his words.
eng_Latn I could no longer be in doubt about that.
eng_Latn from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front.
eng_Latn but when he had copied it carefully, in a large scrawl that was easy to read
eng_Latn then you won't have your conscience to deal with afterwards, either.
eng_Latn for although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship
eng_Latn wipe the nose of your neigbbour's son, and take him into your house.
eng_Latn I sealed the letter, and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor lacquey, with orders to hand it to the addressee in person.
eng_Latn I couldn't be more eager to have mine behind me.
eng_Latn which I did most cordially.
eng_Latn I didn't altogether see why it was of course
eng_Latn worse than any image I'd ever held inside my head.
eng_Latn you won't venture to turn round on your own account.
eng_Latn that instant yearned for so many times and so many times postponed
eng_Latn in pain and sickness it would still be dear.
eng_Latn I despaired of ever expressing myself with such aptness or with such fluency.
eng_Latn he said he preferred the train.
eng_Latn there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear.
eng_Latn as if it lay across his path like an insurmountable object.
eng_Latn to the society he so loved.
eng_Latn I shall attempt to persuade the old lady
eng_Latn she would never be happy until I had left it.
eng_Latn walked on tiptoes to his room.
eng_Latn he said to himself in despair
eng_Latn you would cease to be the executioner, you would take the victim's place.
eng_Latn more fight in her.
eng_Latn I can even say definitely that it was a marriage of affection.
eng_Latn but there's a thing that could be the sun.
eng_Latn as he was out of his senses.
eng_Latn three thousand workers penned up by the station
eng_Latn who nodded, and they left together.
eng_Latn I defended the king.
eng_Latn settled lower against the tree.
eng_Latn such is the law of nature.
eng_Latn wondering whether to slam it shut.
eng_Latn the only one by which he could descend
eng_Latn Where I can hear some jungle! Come on.
eng_Latn the conversation drawing away happily from his health
eng_Latn you begin to say really witty things.
eng_Latn about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element.
eng_Latn I wish I were, if only for the sake of justifying myself in her eyes.
eng_Latn we can succeed in disciplining anyone.
eng_Latn I'm sick of all these reeking bloodsuckers.
eng_Latn so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know and avoid them.
eng_Latn which became to me from that time forth a place of awe and dread
eng_Latn but neither of us put words to it.
eng_Latn I have only the supreme illusion of a lover.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know.... tinned food wasinvented forty five years before they invented the tin opener.
eng_Latn I will never call you aunt again as long as I live.
eng_Latn because he was in misery, the world must be coming to an end.
eng_Latn but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out
eng_Latn I make a snap decision.
eng_Latn let her want to be kissed, first.
eng_Latn but the sum and substance of it was
eng_Latn I trusted her.
eng_Latn she was like as if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her
eng_Latn it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her.
eng_Latn gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced into execution.
eng_Latn I reckon she was so mad he wouldn't give her loads of horrible stuff about me
eng_Latn three paces from her.
eng_Latn that gazing on it, in that full front view
eng_Latn should he fasten the door in his face?
eng_Latn pulled it off.
eng_Latn drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper.
eng_Latn I just didn't want to spend my honeymoon writhing in pain.
eng_Latn we have political passions sometimes.
eng_Latn but suddenly all heads were bared
eng_Latn after ten minutes it came into sight again
eng_Latn close enough that I felt the heat of her breath on my lips.
eng_Latn youre my friend.
eng_Latn I managed to turn the tables on him.
eng_Latn until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.
eng_Latn Let's make it beautiful again.
eng_Latn to arrange her thoughts before going to her father.
eng_Latn I don't maul nobody with a fence stake no more.
eng_Latn How curious. There is writing this wall.
eng_Latn I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord's policy of insurance.
eng_Latn skipped out of the parlour and into the road
eng_Latn performed some affecting tears and sniffs.
eng_Latn he wandered off in the direction of his room
eng_Latn see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion
eng_Latn he was gloomy, not on account of that conversation, but from what he saw at the samovar.
eng_Latn they wonder if we could spare a bite.
eng_Latn Like... what?
eng_Latn but I imagine that to you this is comprehensible.
eng_Latn so he changed his tone, and sharply ordered me to take off my drawers.
eng_Latn don't touch me don't!
eng_Latn even in the spaces that were supposed to serve as passageways.
eng_Latn has been telling me what forces are being collected against him!
eng_Latn that it became clear to the law student's mind that he must have some more certain source of income if he meant to live as he had been doing.
eng_Latn have heard reports of your brother in law having sought her hand, or something of that kind.
eng_Latn Slow down! Stop! I can t watch!
eng_Latn she asked for the truth
eng_Latn then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.
eng_Latn it doesn't make so much difference now she will never know
eng_Latn Perhaps you do not need a captain. If you work together, you could both run the ship for the good of all.
eng_Latn when I laid my hand on its rough sides.
eng_Latn I have done all that I could.
eng_Latn I was left alone with my mother.
eng_Latn I had the misfortune to scream in my sleep, owing to a frightful nightmare.
eng_Latn except that his wasn't the only voice that shouted.
eng_Latn but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear at her devotion and trustfulness
eng_Latn I touched the bump on my stomach that had not been there yesterday.
eng_Latn Ooh. I love hot dogs, evenmore than I love pizza.
eng_Latn was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him
eng_Latn because I meant what I wrote.
eng_Latn than much better food provided for them at home.
eng_Latn the officers and men would be paid the same.
eng_Latn to play my part in the farce to the end
eng_Latn declared it was time to go.
eng_Latn their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene.
eng_Latn that for the first time I shall have to show all I can do.
eng_Latn but lured him back again.
eng_Latn I found out what your 'drug stores' were.
eng_Latn it was at such points that the barricades were situated.
eng_Latn who of his own free will hath exposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee?
eng_Latn but of funds which she can well spare.
eng_Latn but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant.
eng_Latn I'll bet he's got the trains running on time and all his ducks in a row.
eng_Latn I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the world
eng_Latn We re ready to row captain.
eng_Latn that like a neon sign, he only made the same simple patterns over and over again.
eng_Latn one is that of letters, the other that of arms.
eng_Latn I was sorry, I kissed her as she was going.
eng_Latn nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner.
eng_Latn he felt more fear than pleasure.
eng_Latn I have a large team, and obviously they need a lot of briefing.
eng_Latn I can't stand waiting anymore.
eng_Latn I stared at her face and tried to think of some way to make the future bearable.
eng_Latn being one hundred and seventy fivefeet distant
eng_Latn but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare.
eng_Latn I have no control over myself.
eng_Latn but, except the breathing, there was no sign of life.
eng_Latn his heart broke
eng_Latn I do not like the stupid fashions of today.
eng_Latn I thought you didn t like having a bath?
eng_Latn offering his arM
eng_Latn I did it!
eng_Latn the doors were propped open to let in the balmy air.
eng_Latn I ll just watch if you don t mind. I'm not a very good actor and I have snacks.
eng_Latn for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.
eng_Latn well, I won't go on and bore you.
eng_Latn When I put them in my washing machine. I had six but now I only have three! Where did they go?
eng_Latn holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief.
eng_Latn one hand over the side of the canoe in the water
eng_Latn I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.
eng_Latn I am the person you inquired for.
eng_Latn but they were so rooted in local superstition
eng_Latn would they let me since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.
eng_Latn but a burnished poniard sharper than an awl.
eng_Latn Hide! In a bush!? The Queen of England?(change of mood) What fun!
eng_Latn but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days.
eng_Latn that the commander in chief wished
eng_Latn finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual
eng_Latn They re trainee knights, Sire?
eng_Latn I turned away again, and laughed.
eng_Latn since it can deceive and pain you.
eng_Latn ready to join in the fun.
eng_Latn of course, as he now decided, he must be careful about being
eng_Latn abutting it a small greengrocer's and next to that a tumble down tobacconist's.
eng_Latn she drew back a little in her seat to watch him
eng_Latn admirers from which she could take her pick.
eng_Latn if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them
eng_Latn while it surprised her, it warmed her heart and pleased her very much.
eng_Latn with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might follow.
eng_Latn but at that moment the headmaster stood up to speak, and he broke off.
eng_Latn but today it has surpassed my expectations.
eng_Latn the princess inherits
eng_Latn at night they locked their doors in fear and dread.
eng_Latn leaning against the jamb of the door.
eng_Latn these two letters were the first thing of her that he had gained possession of, adorable initials, upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding.
eng_Latn never stopped until he had run a mile or more.
eng_Latn the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by
eng_Latn that is to say, canvassing likely parents.
eng_Latn which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections.
eng_Latn I heard a rustling there.
eng_Latn I've two words to say to you, something pleasant, very pleasant.
eng_Latn I ve never seen a jungle like thisbefore Dog.
eng_Latn the lad would like to be under me and give his mind to business.
eng_Latn you mustn't scold him either, mind.
eng_Latn stirring audience growing completely silent.
eng_Latn as I held them up
eng_Latn but, pretending I was sick, kept close in my cabin.
eng_Latn who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution
eng_Latn I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my provisions
eng_Latn This is a book about greatpainters. And it is called...
eng_Latn held the vessel to his lips
eng_Latn as if some one had thrown a light missile at him.
eng_Latn the metal ain't made that'll hold it for long.
eng_Latn that sudden flare
eng_Latn we can't let you into the gang
eng_Latn but they continued to exist.
eng_Latn to sneer at his watery potion.
eng_Latn blindly stumbled back into his shop, bolting the door behind him.
eng_Latn Graphic novel Pug.
eng_Latn which she never meant to send.
eng_Latn she and her husband both took the fever, and died within a few days of each other.
eng_Latn she rushed out of the room.
eng_Latn I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward
eng_Latn but there was a chance they could go to the police.
eng_Latn but I soon observed
eng_Latn in the common room that night.
eng_Latn I am in my turn bitten by the serpent whose tortuous course
eng_Latn when I'm not having laurie..
eng_Latn the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs.
eng_Latn I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street.
eng_Latn lacking him, there actually was a soullacking.
eng_Latn I may at the same time, very well indeed, be able to dislike some member of your family.
eng_Latn but they had only done it to keep her quiet.
eng_Latn death is sooner over with.
eng_Latn nor could he persuade her to come inside.
eng_Latn cracked her head on the leg of a table.
eng_Latn Have we been here before Granny?
eng_Latn Me-Wow! What a jump!
eng_Latn sleeping in one bed
eng_Latn I was the only one who was thick enough to take that song seriously!
eng_Latn made me a sign to follow him into the third room
eng_Latn with anyone you like.
eng_Latn And they would have gotten away with it if we hadn t read a book.
eng_Latn I won't think about it now.
eng_Latn everyone with a red face, you may be certain
eng_Latn I looked round
eng_Latn moreover, I was excited, almost to a pitch of foolishness, through my nerves and brain.
eng_Latn there is a great deal in the feeling for art which must be acquired
eng_Latn for even if they arrested him and carried him off
eng_Latn must wait for the unseen antagonist to return it to them.
eng_Latn Pug Rock. Pug Rock.Puggy Puggy Puugy Pug Rock. Pug Rock. PUG ROCK.
eng_Latn it might come to him now
eng_Latn caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.
eng_Latn until they left off, of their own will.
eng_Latn there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which bites.
eng_Latn I've thought the thing was in the bag.
eng_Latn I felt some curiosity and excitement about this lady
eng_Latn used to dine alone in his cabin on board ship to the sound of trumpets.
eng_Latn I was perfectly well.
eng_Latn but I never liked him.
eng_Latn it's quite time he did know what his mother was!
eng_Latn did not like to be left alone with the nosy man
eng_Latn we must keep away from the land till we grow weak
eng_Latn like sitting in a waiting room at a dentist's.
eng_Latn others had gone to the front
eng_Latn now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible
eng_Latn for goodness only knew what she was fancying herself.
eng_Latn stopped and leaned over the bed
eng_Latn she and I left the nursery.
eng_Latn but a moment!
eng_Latn he came to demand five millions at once
eng_Latn as steadily declared his intention of offering her his hand.
eng_Latn then he turned and walked quickly away into the darkness.
eng_Latn I rubbed another tear out of my eye before it could fall.
eng_Latn and then went away and immediately did the murder.
eng_Latn you did not expect to have to come backand pay for it anyway.
eng_Latn you shall always remain the friend of the family mine, at all events.
eng_Latn you seem to know as much as I do already
eng_Latn that he is a firm, grave, serious man.
eng_Latn I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has been as much as I want.
eng_Latn it was the smell of gas.
eng_Latn who did not answer but raised his head and again looked into the mother's face.
eng_Latn over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them.
eng_Latn got a right to their own opinion.
eng_Latn stepping barefooted and straight as an arrow, with braids of raven hair, a thick, haughty profile
eng_Latn but that as my father was alive it was his by right to make this demand
eng_Latn And now we know more about your missing sock mystery.
eng_Latn went around, and opened the trunk.
eng_Latn she recalled his composure, and a feeling of anger against him impelled her to tear the sheet with the phrase she had written into tiny bits.
eng_Latn he thought, and stopped short.
eng_Latn I will count myself happy and fortunate.
eng_Latn save that they merely serve to swell the number of those that live
eng_Latn smoothing over difficulties
eng_Latn they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral
eng_Latn I went out into the corridor and listened.
eng_Latn was a glad piece of news
eng_Latn something terribleabout one of our own members.
eng_Latn she knocked on the door and handed the dress to her mother.
eng_Latn They re not giants Mr Kyoto.They re windmills, that use wind, to grind corn.
eng_Latn something was brewing against her peace of mind.
eng_Latn so they could respond immediately.
eng_Latn soon a warm, dry bed received me.
eng_Latn remained motionless on a skylight seat
eng_Latn I said, he must come up.
eng_Latn she looked at her watch till eight
eng_Latn because he knew he was on his way to becoming a mighty ship.
eng_Latn you won't get anything else here. says the vagrant.
eng_Latn if, indeed, such salvation be possible
eng_Latn did he grasp its meaning for a moment.
eng_Latn I was way past being able to respond.
eng_Latn she went into his room to announce her determination.
eng_Latn felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen.
eng_Latn she were free now to take her way
eng_Latn keep at it all night if necessary and do not return here to morrow till after the jailer his visited me
eng_Latn giving the car stop and a description of the house.
eng_Latn And six...and seven.
eng_Latn rsula visited him in his bedroom.
eng_Latn the villains sought his life, not his money
eng_Latn in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady.
eng_Latn but it was as difficult for him to tell the truth as for a stutterer to pronounce words.
eng_Latn but all was still as death.
eng_Latn he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing him close, for oneself,
eng_Latn instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had theretofore done
eng_Latn which they had come to know and todistinguish.
eng_Latn who was to approach him and how.
eng_Latn he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which he found himself.
eng_Latn It was nice to meet you dinosaurs.
eng_Latn the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the captain and the latter by a sign indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade
eng_Latn I'll not take my eyes from your face till you look back at me!
eng_Latn Let the quest begin!
eng_Latn because nobody has any money.
eng_Latn various subjects for annotation have presented themselves
eng_Latn for it was at my house
eng_Latn I am engaged in a work of very great moment.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know... you are amazing facts too? Dog is the first dog to run a bookshop! Pug is the first pug to own ten thousand identical bow ties! And Wow the Owl is admitting for the first time... I'm lost!
eng_Latn I have only the supreme illusion of a lover.
eng_Latn that he had to take great heed to keep his tears
eng_Latn I rise to my feet and stride out of the room, breathing hard.
eng_Latn then pushed the paper a little way from him
eng_Latn I was their chief exponent
eng_Latn to be able to solve so delicate a question
eng_Latn which he had never looked before.
eng_Latn lest if they pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
eng_Latn not to mention the fact that some of those present were particularly detestable in her eyes.
eng_Latn but it was evident that there were several persons at the door
eng_Latn And Pug is very good at helping me help.
eng_Latn sprang helter skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared.
eng_Latn there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to.
eng_Latn with the chain up, and peeping out
eng_Latn Then we must think of another. But let s not stand on the top ofthis hill again.
eng_Latn in a week I shall have left this country
eng_Latn I made him a bow and felt very much overawed.
eng_Latn in the eyes of the world they were a model couple.
eng_Latn I ve never been a Thrilling Three before.
eng_Latn every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us.
eng_Latn now thoroughly roused.
eng_Latn drew my hanger, put it up again.
eng_Latn conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.
eng_Latn you're right sickly yet.
eng_Latn for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me gently into it
eng_Latn for what journeys you take, your own feet will serve you.
eng_Latn I've such an idea for a cotillion!
eng_Latn but at that moment the end of the rod jerked feebly
eng_Latn understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat.
eng_Latn I asked one or two natives if they knew anything about him
eng_Latn with absolutely nowhere to go.
eng_Latn A Dog in the night time!
eng_Latn but flat and inadequate in comparison to the real thing.
eng_Latn but with a simpering boy's face
eng_Latn but irrevocable accidents that brought him to that point.
eng_Latn this was furnished like the first, only after a more elegant manner.
eng_Latn an exciting and novel sensation for him.
eng_Latn as I sat on the ground by the door of my house
eng_Latn you will then need to come here
eng_Latn only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache
eng_Latn that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her.
eng_Latn I'm going as a trooper.
eng_Latn as was shown by a trifling incident.
eng_Latn not from any fault or sins of his
eng_Latn who have not consulted me
eng_Latn I'm LONGING to go back and begin work.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer!
eng_Latn There s nothing here but numbers
eng_Latn So, will you help me?
eng_Latn she is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, papa.
eng_Latn I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than in anyone's.
eng_Latn I notice in the budget you award yourself the sum of ten thousand pounds.
eng_Latn a tiny little dicky bird told me you just might want it.
eng_Latn stay out till two and not do any explainingafterwards.
eng_Latn but a week before that worm had been roused up again with fresh force.
eng_Latn I honestly didnt mind the child.
eng_Latn cried the magistrate, with an accent of horror and consternation
eng_Latn yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude.
eng_Latn until her eventual protests, her infrequent outbursts came forth in an uncontained
eng_Latn along the road, in the snow, the silence and the night, under the cold stars.
eng_Latn I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth reporting.
eng_Latn Now you are mine!
eng_Latn what had society said or done
eng_Latn when all this was observed in him
eng_Latn that there was a puddle in the middle of the street
eng_Latn but they were not at all tired.
eng_Latn they had had time to multiply.
eng_Latn I tried calling her and her mom said she was sick.
eng_Latn appearing in the distance like a boy on a too large horse.
eng_Latn I smiled gently as I wondered whether or not she had fallen in the ocean.
eng_Latn sock it to them.
eng_Latn in the course of which he was in the habit of smoking a cigar.
eng_Latn as I afterwards found, gave his majesty, and the whole court, a very mean opinion of my understanding.
eng_Latn but on commercial speculations.
eng_Latn had deepened into one of pain and horror.
eng_Latn it was difficult to read the expression of her face
eng_Latn he took notice of my gown.
eng_Latn muttered something to his family, who rose
eng_Latn I'm building a model of the entire world five thousand years ago, but I think I ve got the pyramids wrong.
eng_Latn I'm going to look plain next to him no matter what.
eng_Latn as this knotty point is still unsettled,
eng_Latn I wonder what he thought when he saw you sitting at the dining room table for the first time.
eng_Latn he was glad of any occasion to keep me among them
eng_Latn the fourth in six years
eng_Latn Dog! Watch this! Wooh !
eng_Latn you will find the menu of the day on the blotter, beside you.
eng_Latn he seemed to be glad to think that he was still proud.
eng_Latn then, grasping her by the head and throat
eng_Latn to take care of your needs when you were ailing.
eng_Latn was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over
eng_Latn I don't see why you should.
eng_Latn set it on the porch.
eng_Latn adding, that if he was bent upon entering it
eng_Latn I have my servicedoor which opens on the courtyard.
eng_Latn it's pretty important.
eng_Latn it had my cupboard on it.
eng_Latn I grab his arm and try to lift him up
eng_Latn I am Dog and this is Pug. We seekthe Wumpus.
eng_Latn entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street.
eng_Latn but if you would leave the postboy to say that
eng_Latn within his reach was a company larger than anything his father had ever conceived of.
eng_Latn she had fallen dead of fear and of fatigue.
eng_Latn let the hen live
eng_Latn because if my father knew it he would at once fling me down a well and cover me with stones.
eng_Latn until I got my eye above the window sill
eng_Latn seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.
eng_Latn by which he will identify himself.
eng_Latn hastened to the room where he had locked her in.
eng_Latn they waited about half an hour
eng_Latn I couldn't bring myself to admit I'd given up after only one session.
eng_Latn He won t have enough huff and puff left to chase Little Red Riding Hood anymore.
eng_Latn I placed 200 of them on twelve figures, to see what would come of it.
eng_Latn because he was really a man of peaceful and kindly disposition.
eng_Latn but look what we have gained instead!
eng_Latn the same this information astonished and irritated the count .
eng_Latn she watched the bottle clandestinely.
eng_Latn even at the cost of a certain amount of impropriety.
eng_Latn I have found a better remedy for my grief
eng_Latn I shall catch HIM tripping yet, and not he me.
eng_Latn has acknowledged the relationship.
eng_Latn I will come to that later.
eng_Latn but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out, so laboriously framed.
eng_Latn I didn't do that.
eng_Latn I got hold of a piece of paper and a pencil.
eng_Latn being already spent with labour while we were in the ship.
eng_Latn then lifted his lip
eng_Latn Split up to search?
eng_Latn as became a pirate
eng_Latn I wandered up to the church.
eng_Latn I don't approve of the match any more than you do
eng_Latn such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.
eng_Latn but as a man now fully devoted to him
eng_Latn so dark it seemed almost resinous and pitchy.
eng_Latn I must know more about it.
eng_Latn evidently with no other object than to make a noise there.
eng_Latn he stood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing.
eng_Latn for he was still clinging to the faith that tomorrow or next day he would be better, and could go back to his job.
eng_Latn when you really want something, the universe always conspires in your favor.
eng_Latn revealed the same strength of character.
eng_Latn I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering and oh!
eng_Latn I go straight home and make myself some hot chocolate
eng_Latn I saw my reflection glimmer in his agonized eyes as the sun touched my own skin.
eng_Latn they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again
eng_Latn she left her vulgar teasing
eng_Latn it's unseemly for you.
eng_Latn hence the absolute empireof the man over that woman.
eng_Latn I understand thee still less now
eng_Latn she felt once again the powerful magnetism of the man.
eng_Latn for he had found his two days with her in the country somewhat tedious
eng_Latn I'm not bisexual, either!
eng_Latn dispensing the currant wine in a little glass without a foot, which was his own property.
eng_Latn I did exactly as you told me.
eng_Latn I didn't see where that was so much better.
eng_Latn I thought about ducking out
eng_Latn A-MAZE-ing work Doris!
eng_Latn she has given him a sort of promise according to what he turns out.
eng_Latn the inspector arrived with the intern
eng_Latn they sat down.
eng_Latn to withdraw quietly into a little drawing room, especially her own, next to the great sala.
eng_Latn I didn't even check if I got the right sex.
eng_Latn it is not fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way concerned.
eng_Latn but they were few and slight, and she believed them over.
eng_Latn as well as his high blood relations with his family
eng_Latn He s definitely friendly!
eng_Latn I'm ready to tell the whole story of my life
eng_Latn I expected no peace no pleasure there.
eng_Latn but I made haste to plunge into intellectual conversation to smooth over the defects of my attire.
eng_Latn I'm not even a real doggy biscuit. Real doggy biscuits grow on trees!
eng_Latn to do nothing, in short, was to do everything!
eng_Latn that he more than once gave the matter up for lost
eng_Latn go into the market places to his heart's content.
eng_Latn more like two lovers than teacher and pupil.
eng_Latn keeping her head down and working in silence.
eng_Latn if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
eng_Latn as though it were heavy.
eng_Latn waving to apress boy who was near gave it to him together with the money.
eng_Latn that a time is coming when they will not be afraid any more.
eng_Latn I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible.
eng_Latn neither could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor informed me.
eng_Latn He has a really big heart!
eng_Latn I have heard him tell of it many times, and he got three dollars a week, at first.
eng_Latn for you to go on fighting with
eng_Latn Dog loves…
eng_Latn glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road
eng_Latn listen for dripping wate
eng_Latn but you were right to return as soon as possible my boy
eng_Latn the town house went for taxes
eng_Latn losing money is like pouring water on the sand.
eng_Latn there was always the other great dread
eng_Latn for any body else who would be puzzled.
eng_Latn But a bit too small for a Dave. When we try to play together, things sort of go wrong.
eng_Latn You just need to face your fearhead on. How about we throw a coming out party for you?
eng_Latn the unknown lords and ladies who lived there never forgot
eng_Latn but it was not of his own seeking.
eng_Latn I grabbed a horse
eng_Latn with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.
eng_Latn he was corrupted by his environment,' and so on.
eng_Latn there was no time to reflect upon or to controvert his statement
eng_Latn for we have our secret police department where private information is received.
eng_Latn I sole de hide en taller for a dollar en ten cents.
eng_Latn all was still in shadow
eng_Latn I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.
eng_Latn he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing
eng_Latn I am teaching him, developing him.
eng_Latn but really the act of marrying this wife was a set off against the obligation.
eng_Latn so mild that I must draw back from your great fire.
eng_Latn I'm Pug.
eng_Latn wrapped herself up, without opening her lips.
eng_Latn much more than I am for myself.
eng_Latn as if he had been a friend or the master of the place.
eng_Latn after wards something in the man heartening him, wishing that he hadnot.
eng_Latn I turned again to the house
eng_Latn was one with the babe whom she had loved
eng_Latn then took it out
eng_Latn sent him starting up from the bench.
eng_Latn were finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out
eng_Latn touched the glass with it
eng_Latn ...I love books after the bookshop has had a bit of a clean!
eng_Latn fixing himself on this very superior family.
eng_Latn that she was going to be able todecide for herself whether she wanted me to marry her or not.
eng_Latn You can take that knowledge home with you and use it to do something useful.
eng_Latn though you should live more years than sarna.
eng_Latn I spun sharply around the corner
eng_Latn didn't speak at all until they had climbed two floors up.
eng_Latn this morning there were reasons why I ought to have been in a better mood.
eng_Latn Can we go camping too?
eng_Latn I was glad he'd thought of it.
eng_Latn I shrugged and let myself in.
eng_Latn loaded with irons, covered with dirt, with vermin,
eng_Latn then he stopped short.
eng_Latn I, too, despaired at last,and I began my homeward journey.
eng_Latn knew there was only that moment and that
eng_Latn I just don't know if I feel like a darling.
eng_Latn but died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.
eng_Latn there we are about equal
eng_Latn with a paper parcel under his arm.
eng_Latn she yelled, so loudly that he jumped.
eng_Latn apprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed.
eng_Latn wait till you've got a beard to your chin.
eng_Latn I grabbed his face in my hands and waited until he opened his eyes.
eng_Latn I sighed and gave her the key.
eng_Latn I think you'll find it a real challenge.
eng_Latn as it has been with several others
eng_Latn I wish there was something we could do.
eng_Latn but a short time only had elapsed when a noise he heard behind him awoke him
eng_Latn tugging at his arm.
eng_Latn but not one fell close by, they all flew over.
eng_Latn the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me.
eng_Latn I fell at once into a solitary condition, apart from all friendly notice,
eng_Latn I can do very little reading myself, but I have a friend he can.
eng_Latn as if she were cut glass.
eng_Latn the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy
eng_Latn seeing that there was nothing against me
eng_Latn I am glad to dwell upon the earnestness and love with which she lifted up her face to mine, and did so.
eng_Latn I could force nothing on him
eng_Latn do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself?
eng_Latn but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone
eng_Latn as if the contact stung.
eng_Latn I mean, it would have been fine, if ' what I mean is, if you give me another chance, I'll do better.
eng_Latn poured out his glass of ale
eng_Latn he stiffly indicated a chair.
eng_Latn some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her.
eng_Latn only wished that a lion or a serpent, or any ill disposed monster, would make an attack upon us,
eng_Latn we followed the same road which we saw the shepherd take
eng_Latn taken half the paper with it.
eng_Latn I pick my way across the room, dump the box on the floor
eng_Latn but he has never come back and now it is almost one
eng_Latn that the fellow is innocent
eng_Latn I wasn't sure how I felt about that.
eng_Latn these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened.
eng_Latn when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman walked in.
eng_Latn but she covered her cherry lips with her hands, and said she wasn't a baby now, and ran away
eng_Latn but he mustn't catch it yet
eng_Latn before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind.
eng_Latn I doubted I could come up with the appropriate analogy to explain this one.
eng_Latn Do you have any bamboo leaves?
eng_Latn past the friendship I have had in my heart for you has ripened into a deeper feeling, a
eng_Latn at least he was there in time
eng_Latn but this much I will say
eng_Latn that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her.
eng_Latn had therefore leisure to look around
eng_Latn but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value.
eng_Latn after dragging from her those things which were most precious to her and trampling on them
eng_Latn I'll tell her what I think of her and then walk straight out of the house!
eng_Latn Hop on the magic pillowcase Pug, I'm smell an adventure.
eng_Latn his share in the higher education of this country did not seem to help him.
eng_Latn this is not the way to rob a man of my standing.
eng_Latn calling to my mother.
eng_Latn And throw!
eng_Latn I hate to charge you, but with things the way they are
eng_Latn pray to be better!
eng_Latn rolled over in his sleep.
eng_Latn I rubbed mine afterwards, to warm it, AND TO RUB HIS OFF.
eng_Latn they had retaliated by teasing him.
eng_Latn he brought her to me.
eng_Latn I think we'll be okay
eng_Latn the two corners of her mouth unequally raised, and her upper lip
eng_Latn whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet.
eng_Latn no one then longer needs my useless life
eng_Latn I have never had time to give myself much to natural history.
eng_Latn bent his bow against a damsel who stood between the turrets of the castle
eng_Latn I have a lot to do before the holidays.
eng_Latn a voyage that was to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the end of six months.
eng_Latn excepting the waistcoat, which could not be found
eng_Latn time had only strengthened in her absence
eng_Latn he was explaining it to me again only yesterday.
eng_Latn I broke another tree trying to hold myself here.
eng_Latn they were quiet, staring into the fire.
eng_Latn I will make you know that you are behaving as a coward.
eng_Latn we saw that there was no sign of a wound
eng_Latn I was coming to tell you so.
eng_Latn for she was not bound to perform miracles
eng_Latn was watching things very closely.
eng_Latn you should open your own account here.
eng_Latn because she shot him through his identification card.
eng_Latn who was his sister, and ten years his junior.
eng_Latn his heart had prompted him to beg her to leave her husband.
eng_Latn looked at it a moment
eng_Latn she gazed a moment
eng_Latn I said, he must come up.
eng_Latn By my Granny...Granny Pug!
eng_Latn knocked three times on the castle door.
eng_Latn the stink was somewhat between a weasel and a fox
eng_Latn by virtue of the wall surrounding the entire place.
eng_Latn stagger with her out of the room.
eng_Latn to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship during that time without claiming her love.
eng_Latn moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her.
eng_Latn although he had not planned on meeting him, anyway.
eng_Latn I shall remain entirely alone!
eng_Latn it must have been held up in the post.
eng_Latn I'd still got plenty of money in the bank, nearly two hundred quid
eng_Latn Oh, that s good. I'm delivering apizza to my Grandma s house but the Big Bad Wolf wants to snatch it.
eng_Latn handsome moving toward her as she entered the room.
eng_Latn that he had been overwhelmed by the burden of disillusion.
eng_Latn with what, since no thought of the camera had come up as yet.
eng_Latn I was going to walk in any case.
eng_Latn she had a remarkable ability for manual work
eng_Latn upstairs almost all the rooms were finished.
eng_Latn gave a spoonful of marrow syrup to each one
eng_Latn there was a snake beside his chair.
eng_Latn yelped even louder.
eng_Latn we'll set the candle on the stairs.
eng_Latn till he grew up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief.
eng_Latn she should know that she had one slave in the world
eng_Latn But you can play now that we rehere.
eng_Latn there were other people on hand to share her triumph.
eng_Latn with as little appearance as possible of doing so.
eng_Latn so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farm house
eng_Latn after staying long enough in the pump room to discover that the crowd was insupportable
eng_Latn that he has received the letter, and will come.
eng_Latn I have no more than hinted in awkward speech.
eng_Latn my greatest troubles in their passage rose from our little lady's trifling illnesses
eng_Latn when it was learned that the announcement of the pontifical visit had been a lie spread by the government
eng_Latn about how I couldn't use it for three months
eng_Latn circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings.
eng_Latn it is that there is no one left to give us orders.
eng_Latn gave a feeble hoot of thanks
eng_Latn that would be a mistake.
eng_Latn what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded
eng_Latn I hope they have that camera that takes your picture.
eng_Latn I wallowed in that delusion so long I left it too late, too late!
eng_Latn I would have offered you something.
eng_Latn Have you ever had to deal withspiders Mr Coyote?
eng_Latn that we might give a happy ending to a beginning so prosperous.
eng_Latn would not be back before the morning.
eng_Latn that is forgetfulness, repose, exclusion from life
eng_Latn I need some guns taken on board a boat.
eng_Latn she was not satisfied until she had upset her altogether.
eng_Latn but that they should place before them what is good
eng_Latn she gave him a startled sidelong glance and said nothing.
eng_Latn I think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time
eng_Latn let his arms float wide and limp in spite of the pain.
eng_Latn with your posthorses going at the rate of two leagues an hour
eng_Latn I simply took you to be drunk, and you were drunk, too.
eng_Latn the desire grew to be so intense
eng_Latn I think he wants to race!
eng_Latn I wouldn't expect very much until I was able toearn it, of course.
eng_Latn I scanned the screen in my peripheral vision.
eng_Latn he was called a snotty little kid, and told to go to bed.
eng_Latn Please excuse them Pug. They re just a few of my stray thoughts.
eng_Latn I love my father
eng_Latn I repeat it again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal.
eng_Latn as they had come only for a short time
eng_Latn he went off to see my father
eng_Latn hoping you find yourself well, sir!
eng_Latn but the sizzling steam made me fear a general explosion which would sweep across my men swarming like ants over the booty with a blast of jagged fragments.
eng_Latn the young landowner had been a long while betrothed to her
eng_Latn but not enough for the captain's fancy
eng_Latn racked me with another shudder and I nearly went to my knees.
eng_Latn And the number that comes after seven.
eng_Latn I wouldn't know what to say to him.
eng_Latn Why don t you pick on constructionequipment your own size?
eng_Latn I got tired of trying to stay away from you.
eng_Latn don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
eng_Latn I want capital to build my plans upon.
eng_Latn pondered a long time.
eng_Latn was rising from the pavement by the side of the grindstone
eng_Latn they were rather out, in this particular instance.
eng_Latn I didn't even tell my mother till it had healed up.
eng_Latn which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night.
eng_Latn Oh, it's not for me Dog. It's for aclever plan!
eng_Latn I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman
eng_Latn I stare at her
eng_Latn I'll not do anything.
eng_Latn the divan room, where they were playing chess
eng_Latn but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the world that he looked upon himself as dead
eng_Latn one would lose too much time over it.
eng_Latn at last, from the week after next to next week, this week, the day after tomorrow, tomorrow, today, tonight
eng_Latn they hardly heeded this detail.
eng_Latn when we agreed to camp again in the valley bed.
eng_Latn it halted a few yards away from him.
eng_Latn the professor showed me several volumes in large folio
eng_Latn that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish.
eng_Latn swooped in ever increasing circles outward from the beach, searching.
eng_Latn I just want you to say if you can
eng_Latn he knew it as surely as if she had told him so in words.
eng_Latn but that seemed to him quite natural.
eng_Latn I sat up awkwardly, still tangled in my blanket.
eng_Latn that they might do it.
eng_Latn I thank you for the warning
eng_Latn I don't know nothing much about it.
eng_Latn they're on their way west already
eng_Latn I'm such a goose about business.
eng_Latn after all she's done for us!
eng_Latn Hmm. Someone doesn t sound happy. Ismell an intriguing situation. This way, Pug.
eng_Latn being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her father's house.
eng_Latn he offered his homages to madame and his respects to monsieur
eng_Latn Dog, have you seen my crayons?
eng_Latn but the afternoon sun hit him full in the face and she had to close it again.
eng_Latn that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it would still remain piteous and plain.
eng_Latn we saw with horror that they were all mottled with bruises.
eng_Latn he turned his face upon the pillow
eng_Latn he never saved his money when he was earning good wages, so now he has to live on the town.
eng_Latn Hmm Ah. Take in the fresh air Pug. The perfect peace. The tranquility. The...
eng_Latn for that is the name of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery
eng_Latn he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
eng_Latn smiling, she reined in the chestnut mare and waited for him to catch up.
eng_Latn we came to a long kind of building, made of timber stuck in the ground
eng_Latn I've told you why I'm talking of them.
eng_Latn the atmosphere in the office was grim.
eng_Latn did he grasp its meaning for a moment.
eng_Latn I never saw him after that.
eng_Latn so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
eng_Latn I can never enjoy.
eng_Latn now declared that he had seen and examined it there and that th ewounds
eng_Latn that the young girl had been overcome
eng_Latn I will die,' she exclaimed, 'since no one cares anything about me.
eng_Latn on the very morning after his having had the pleasure of seeing her.
eng_Latn I wouldn't say it to anyone else.
eng_Latn he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to you when first I came.
eng_Latn I must warn you that I'm armed.
eng_Latn had been endowed by its late doting owner with a fitting residence.
eng_Latn but the surprise it occasioned
eng_Latn remembered how she asked him if he was proposing to her
eng_Latn if they were all of the same size with him that I saw.
eng_Latn presently returned with the wagon
eng_Latn I will not stir.
eng_Latn I prefer to wait and hope for better things.
eng_Latn I've got all my faculties as well as ever I had in my life.
eng_Latn then, through the fog that was drowning him
eng_Latn that to the quick, with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
eng_Latn then it seemed as though he were slashing vigorously at the wall.
eng_Latn for it was the second time within a month
eng_Latn the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.
eng_Latn I already called in sick at my building.
eng_Latn Your Majesty.
eng_Latn Why is a bit of the sky missing?
eng_Latn she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before,
eng_Latn I don't know for sure that I should, but to hell with it.
eng_Latn I'd never thought so much about it before.
eng_Latn I saw her scarf and gloves lying on a chair in the hall.
eng_Latn I cry, and flinch as he gives a tiny half smile.
eng_Latn one of the first things to be made better is the state of the land and the laborers.
eng_Latn at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother
eng_Latn but afterwards she got on perfectly
eng_Latn as he did so his face broke into an expression of amusement
eng_Latn that his condition of health is not occasioned by attachment to you.
eng_Latn it was her turn to think.
eng_Latn I don't mean to submit tamely to insult and robbery.
eng_Latn too miserable to speak.
eng_Latn you're like the weather cock on a roof.
eng_Latn so that he might have seized her twice over
eng_Latn the power you have over me
eng_Latn I am sure it almost killed me once.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! If we turn ourselves into cats we can catch them!
eng_Latn he said vaguely.
eng_Latn people ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators
eng_Latn jabbing his wand at the list
eng_Latn the children themselves were even now repaying her in small joys for her sufferings.
eng_Latn but not now, for every process has its law.
eng_Latn he had boarded the night mail with two minutes to spare.
eng_Latn I like baths Pug.
eng_Latn he ventured to say, since he could not help feeling that she would.
eng_Latn soon got upon firm ground
eng_Latn because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led.
eng_Latn he is not one of those fools who never change their opinions.
eng_Latn that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint.
eng_Latn as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting.
eng_Latn You have a very loud horn.
eng_Latn It's a deal!
eng_Latn But I never learnt how to draw.
eng_Latn or cease to identify myself with that truth which an evil generation hates.
eng_Latn I have no other friend like her and never shall have.
eng_Latn I could not hope to do more.
eng_Latn I pulled myself up on my elbow so that I could see his face better.
eng_Latn was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness.
eng_Latn I stare at her
eng_Latn waited patiently for him to spy her.
eng_Latn You re not Little Red Riding Hoods!
eng_Latn No, that s a ship in the docks.
eng_Latn was now a race of turbulent yellow waters.
eng_Latn as if she knocked its brains out
eng_Latn then in a moment fell down again
eng_Latn I have heard curious tales about her before now
eng_Latn where I saw the king seated on his throne
eng_Latn You were so brave Super-Puppy.
eng_Latn because I had given the provocation.
eng_Latn the cups where leaf joined stalk were filled with dust.
eng_Latn they were all quiet until the lay sister left the room.
eng_Latn Um... I'm not very good at balancing, Dog.
eng_Latn by my free will
eng_Latn How curious
eng_Latn it got on his mind and turned his brain
eng_Latn that there was nothing else left for him
eng_Latn said he thought that would suit him.
eng_Latn I didn't recognize the male voice, fierce and deep
eng_Latn you sully my honour.
eng_Latn have no name for this vice in their language
eng_Latn his head inclined in the direction of new noises.
eng_Latn I lent you money and you returned it
eng_Latn religion and agriculture more.
eng_Latn without any danger of coming back prodigies.
eng_Latn but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door
eng_Latn Sometimes even a simple questioncan have LOTS of answers, depending on who and where you are.
eng_Latn she was filled once she reached fifteen and sixteen
eng_Latn the congratulation on their long postponed meeting to an anxious inquiry, whether he were worse than usual?
eng_Latn put his legs out of the window
eng_Latn hoping to make something good enough to print.
eng_Latn I hadn't been this far into these woods since I was eleven
eng_Latn than she had previously thought.
eng_Latn This is the greatest day of my life.
eng_Latn Will not!
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn That s my new favourite book!
eng_Latn No, this!
eng_Latn but we're just too scared to say anything.
eng_Latn had hindered it from becoming anything more than the substantial dwelling of a gentleman farmer.
eng_Latn I already called in sick at my building.
eng_Latn beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter
eng_Latn to one side a great theater lapped up the rock.
eng_Latn Before you draw anymore, could you make us who we used to be please?
eng_Latn when he was told he had an urgent telegram on the line.
eng_Latn some area railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits
eng_Latn but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.
eng_Latn as he threw open the door.
eng_Latn someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table.
eng_Latn but I'll endure it till one o'clock.
eng_Latn the renegade comforted them by telling them that they were not held as captives
eng_Latn Nurses... Nerds... Ahh Nursery Rhymes!
eng_Latn it contained a few poor articles of household furniture a bed, a table, two chairs, a stone pitcher
eng_Latn was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor
eng_Latn but he complained that his stock was low
eng_Latn A power cut. There s nothing we cando but wait until the electricity comes back on.
eng_Latn but of late my worrys become an obsession.
eng_Latn that I entered on a firm resolution never to return to humankind
eng_Latn suddenly everything was absolutely clear.
eng_Latn I didn't much care for it.
eng_Latn I was left alone with my mother.
eng_Latn he opened up the most hidden passageways of his heart
eng_Latn gazed about wondering at the wealth
eng_Latn I folded the paper
eng_Latn I had not one.
eng_Latn swallowed with difficulty because his throat was dry.
eng_Latn I was foolish enough to imagine the memory of her mother might disarm him from desiring her injury.
eng_Latn I'll go and tell him you will come directly.
eng_Latn because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows
eng_Latn which they feared more than anything in the world.
eng_Latn yellin' your head off.
eng_Latn even if it had to use force for the purpose.
eng_Latn Ta-dah!
eng_Latn it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose.
eng_Latn carrying her coffee and her toast with her as she did every day
eng_Latn even when the power went down last night.
eng_Latn but aware that her talk was pleasant and her hands beautiful she went on explaining.
eng_Latn must never be withdrawn as long as he lived.
eng_Latn or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee
eng_Latn to take such a step without father's or mother's consent!
eng_Latn for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.
eng_Latn she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights
eng_Latn as she had done almost every night for the past few months.
eng_Latn summer lying dormant in unnumbered skeleton trees.
eng_Latn it is not fitting that honest men should be the instruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way concerned.
eng_Latn but with great alertness of movement down the staircase and out into the garden.
eng_Latn despair of nothing we would attain,
eng_Latn I must admit this is nice, to stop and give ourselves a little break from the track.
eng_Latn with that of the mythical warrior
eng_Latn had but one outlet to the gallery in the sight of everybody.
eng_Latn the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath
eng_Latn I'm simply unhappy.
eng_Latn I must go off at once.
eng_Latn with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite.
eng_Latn administered to a young girl!
eng_Latn gave him a new proof, if he had needed one, of his popularity as a leader.
eng_Latn I detest the smugness of the whole affair, he thought
eng_Latn I want you to cover it.
eng_Latn We re in the middle of anotherwonderful summer Pug.
eng_Latn so changed she was
eng_Latn the best he could suggest was that both were to try
eng_Latn again she earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.
eng_Latn but the third which he tried was, from the dull sound it gave out, evidently full.
eng_Latn a welcome relief after breathing their dust for several miles
eng_Latn I hope that I have taught you at least one amazing thing today.
eng_Latn as it seemed impossible to restrain him
eng_Latn do not move!
eng_Latn Do you mind? Some people are tryingto think around here!
eng_Latn sighing once or twice
eng_Latn smoothing her rich hair with as much pride
eng_Latn as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood
eng_Latn Let’s investigate!
eng_Latn the execution was to be carried out within twenty four hours.
eng_Latn have no passion to hide or confess.
eng_Latn with marvellous quickness he flung himself headforemost into the sea
eng_Latn while she had but one foot on those same roads.
eng_Latn claiming that his scar was hurting too badly to continue studying.
eng_Latn got on board with all my little cargo of provisions.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer Dog, but not as Bow-Wowzer as the herring who talks to its herring friends through its bottom burps!
eng_Latn I thought you would be hopeless
eng_Latn then to run with great speed to the trench, toopen it once more and to seize the treasure which the black manhas necessarily placed there.
eng_Latn followed by his wife
eng_Latn had to seek other pastimes for his idle hours.
eng_Latn till I see you are fit to mount your horse.
eng_Latn I love you.
eng_Latn I never knowed one of 'em that finished up.
eng_Latn packed with hundreds of tourists from countries all over the world.
eng_Latn to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.
eng_Latn I deleted it.
eng_Latn Wow the Owl, are you sure this is the right way to the herring facts?
eng_Latn but I must bepaid for all those little things.
eng_Latn I don't know.
eng_Latn should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon.
eng_Latn I know now that you have never loved before.
eng_Latn ...I love books....
eng_Latn with nothing very pleasant in his face.
eng_Latn stayed in the gloom of the damp stable.
eng_Latn it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness.
eng_Latn two pictures in a gold case, on one side her mother, and on the other uncle, when they were young.
eng_Latn eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her.
eng_Latn I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.
eng_Latn his wife believed as simply as he had believed in his earliest childhood
eng_Latn should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the fire of the sentinels
eng_Latn the father of three children, one of them a son already studying medicine in order to succeed to his father's practice.
eng_Latn she wasn't a teacher to cross.
eng_Latn who's standing by the door holding a glass of wine.
eng_Latn I'm making a new swimming pool.
eng_Latn so different from the man he used to be.
eng_Latn on seeing which
eng_Latn tell me the name of the president of the club
eng_Latn I don't have a regular girl friend.
eng_Latn the chill of that sudden, hurt silence.
eng_Latn Thank you, Mr. Moon. Would you likea baboon, I mean, balloon?
eng_Latn but was quickly, instantly, on his guard.
eng_Latn or if she was the one he was looking for
eng_Latn that I, too, was given an appointment at the green bench today!
eng_Latn then you may easily find me out.
eng_Latn then with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants
eng_Latn the foot of that mountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him.
eng_Latn it rested with him to punish them and there would always be time for that.
eng_Latn the other half she could give to her own view of the subject.
eng_Latn flicked through the blank pages
eng_Latn a man approached and gave him a letter.
eng_Latn that if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort
eng_Latn she fancied she heard goat bells ringing in their passes
eng_Latn Hello. I am Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn begged her to proceed.
eng_Latn that did not make her a bit less lovable.
eng_Latn not as a substitute for the host.
eng_Latn And that is the first difference! I don t wear a bow tie.
eng_Latn but the death of his brother had put him in possession of the manor also.
eng_Latn as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for my child.
eng_Latn though he was in his own element.
eng_Latn nevertheless, make up her mind to renounce the world, sir
eng_Latn as if she needed more than her usual amount of preparation.
eng_Latn dinged frighteningly in her heart like a death bell sounding.
eng_Latn I shall not scold, but I don't like your conduct there.
eng_Latn if the author of our history has not put it in
eng_Latn let me go my way alone.
eng_Latn but it was enough.
eng_Latn they had never before gained tokens of this favor so easily.
eng_Latn wish he hadn't seen that.
eng_Latn I put the phone away, run my fingers through my hair
eng_Latn I'm telling them you all abducted me.
eng_Latn dressed in full mourning
eng_Latn but the officer would not hear of it.
eng_Latn almost immediately say something about its being chilly and suggested taking a stroll.
eng_Latn I am sure it will cool down if you blow on it Pug.
eng_Latn we had better take the opposite direction, eh?
eng_Latn where she had gone for a job interview as someone's secretary.
eng_Latn her person pleasing
eng_Latn I had not left the house for years.
eng_Latn it was only a matter of time before I caught him.
eng_Latn I wasn't as angry with the source of my exposure as I would have expected to feel.
eng_Latn I'm just the one who has the unpleasant task of breaking the news to you.
eng_Latn went with the wild, dark plumed name
eng_Latn but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him
eng_Latn you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.
eng_Latn I would be identified as having been with her.
eng_Latn she had been convinced that she had left behind a seed of hatred in him
eng_Latn It means Two-Beards takes over theship and runs it better.
eng_Latn the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily
eng_Latn even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever
eng_Latn a man who seemed to have been waiting for him approached
eng_Latn then give it to his excellency.
eng_Latn I turned directly, came back, and looked again.
eng_Latn for he refused to part with his secret.
eng_Latn Oh no. I thought you were me crew. They re lost, which is strange as they all have maps like mine.
eng_Latn her small feet turning under her
eng_Latn Clearly Pug learned a lot about hiding from those chameleons.
eng_Latn Why the Wowbowzer?
eng_Latn as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first
eng_Latn looked at it a moment
eng_Latn nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.
eng_Latn for the carriage being stopped a while, to adjust something that was out of order
eng_Latn he could gaze down upon her whole person
eng_Latn I didn't do that.
eng_Latn I don't want you for nothing, anyway.
eng_Latn to see only what may be of practical use at the moment.
eng_Latn which seemed to magnify her own
eng_Latn began explaining the whole position of our troops.
eng_Latn I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.
eng_Latn I loved her more than ever.
eng_Latn but his beastly voice was so weak that I didn't hear.
eng_Latn in case I want you again.
eng_Latn but nothing happened during three days
eng_Latn That s MY den in the basement! Am I going to be down there?
eng_Latn I should only smash my skull with the hammer!
eng_Latn was folded one over another.
eng_Latn Hold tight Pug. We will save you.
eng_Latn at least, a breathing space in which we could think as a biographer
eng_Latn he seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.
eng_Latn begging me to attend the opera.
eng_Latn of the country where they set me on shore
eng_Latn alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,
eng_Latn I don't think he's ever sold a picture.
eng_Latn each drover had two or three droves to look after.
eng_Latn told him to lie down there, and rest himself.
eng_Latn it was in this chamber he breathed his last
eng_Latn who adjured his mother to perform her first duty
eng_Latn I couldn't see.
eng_Latn to make him governor of, as he had promised.
eng_Latn because it was sour
eng_Latn which she did with right good will
eng_Latn so over the old man's face there now stole some such added gloom as this.
eng_Latn the fire which followed
eng_Latn when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit
eng_Latn the hour, the circumstances,the surroundings,were in keeping with it.
eng_Latn I had two years to run, when I left, he answered.
eng_Latn bought their freedom one by one or ran away
eng_Latn for it is impossible to have the heart
eng_Latn reached a high, steady hum, and leveled off.
eng_Latn a glance at the placid face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was intended.
eng_Latn YOU don't like trouble and danger.
eng_Latn or had deserted her
eng_Latn I have a house up in the hills that's very private.
eng_Latn I think you just want to get rid of him!
eng_Latn I told them everything just as it was.
eng_Latn which affected her very deeply, she has not completely recovered her reason
eng_Latn said the old lady, laughing
eng_Latn he is even completely destitute of what is called the genius of art.
eng_Latn I am the fastest!
eng_Latn you looked through me, and frowned
eng_Latn I was left as weak as ever I had been
eng_Latn resuming the letter.
eng_Latn This is a book about two friendswho wanted to play together and it is called...
eng_Latn it was evidently useless to resist.
eng_Latn with so many turns and so great dexterity
eng_Latn gown, threw aside the drapery and for a moment stood motionless
eng_Latn is, that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the body
eng_Latn her tone growing more forlorn with each word.
eng_Latn who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
eng_Latn I tried to make it keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all.
eng_Latn Where is my Snug? Where is my Snout? Where is my Bottom?
eng_Latn smitten with pride
eng_Latn slouched out of the room.
eng_Latn especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes
eng_Latn as you've plenty of money of your own
eng_Latn I remembered him forcing himself out of wolf form for me.
eng_Latn we may be able to save her.
eng_Latn during a party game
eng_Latn as he has sworn to me by the order of knighthood which he has received
eng_Latn for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.
eng_Latn he is very unfortunate
eng_Latn the player devil must not go off boasting
eng_Latn I'll make you late for school.
eng_Latn her betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations with her.
eng_Latn twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.
eng_Latn I would gladly eat a bit of something
eng_Latn she remembered it long afterwards.
eng_Latn it fell on him after he shot it.
eng_Latn eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her.
eng_Latn I could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other.
eng_Latn then licked some up on his tongue.
eng_Latn which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn't know why.
eng_Latn his expression was icy and hostile.
eng_Latn I haven't the faintest idea whether he would make good ornot.
eng_Latn if anything be needed for the execution of your purpose
eng_Latn Trim the sails! Raise the anchor!
eng_Latn you have no reason to dislike me
eng_Latn did just that, divorced her.
eng_Latn that it was as if a cannon ball had hit me and got stuck inside.
eng_Latn above some a crown carved on the same tree
eng_Latn but the laugh on his lips froze in wonder.
eng_Latn I explained that I wanted two thousand of them.
eng_Latn all my life I had this feeling that something wonderful was about to happen to me.
eng_Latn I seen it was that way.
eng_Latn I ve just perfected a recipe for lava cakes I'm sure you ll enjoy.
eng_Latn to hand a glass of water without looking
eng_Latn this time, that his mood in regard to her was different, colder.
eng_Latn to come and see it, for it was worth seeing.
eng_Latn I'm doing my best HEEEEEEELP!!!
eng_Latn I'm not nervous
eng_Latn I was nearly shouting to you,
eng_Latn how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him.
eng_Latn for the reason that he could not afford to keep a secretary only an unpaid servant.
eng_Latn you must be tenacious of life.
eng_Latn then dropped his headquickly.
eng_Latn see if she could not secure a church, or two, or three, in which to speak and plead his cause.
eng_Latn the taboos and inhibitions of womanhood not yet a part of her world.
eng_Latn I must speak.
eng_Latn the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed.
eng_Latn like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.
eng_Latn which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness.
eng_Latn was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance.
eng_Latn so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each
eng_Latn because it had been in the water so long it warn't much like a face at all.
eng_Latn I ain't got nothing on under my trousers.
eng_Latn finding on the beach a little bark without oars, sail, mast, or tackling of any kind, in the intrepidity of his heart flings himself into it
eng_Latn with incredible accuracy and nimbleness
eng_Latn Astounding Feats of Balance. (The Story of the World s Greatest Acrobat) .
eng_Latn I'd made up my mine 'bout what I's agwyne to do.
eng_Latn then shouts of hurrah! ' and jivio!
eng_Latn but these days, of course, that meant nothing.
eng_Latn Oooh ... I can t wait! Thank you Dog and Pug...
eng_Latn a doublebarreled shotgun clutched in both hands.
eng_Latn Hello. I'm Dog and...
eng_Latn however reluctantly and gloomily
eng_Latn I don't know what has changed and what hasn't.
eng_Latn said she could not enter.
eng_Latn I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.
eng_Latn I hope those naughty bookshop micewere listening.
eng_Latn so bewildered him with fine words
eng_Latn even her whispers were loud and liable to sudden bursts like those of a deranged barrel organ.
eng_Latn keep their distance.
eng_Latn there was a good deal of talk among them in the language of the country, not without some laughter at my expense.
eng_Latn he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes.
eng_Latn one is enough till another is wanted.
eng_Latn because he was really a man of peaceful and kindly disposition.
eng_Latn he seemed to struggle against the mortal sleep.
eng_Latn even the external forms, indeed, he fancied, must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything.
eng_Latn to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment
eng_Latn to see if all the edges were perfect
eng_Latn noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her
eng_Latn but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble.
eng_Latn I floundered around in my head, trying to remember how to close it.
eng_Latn Whoa! Hop on boys.
eng_Latn at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant
eng_Latn I told her about your parents and said that's what was wrong with you.
eng_Latn or they had cut themselves, and had blood poisoning, or met with some other accident.
eng_Latn really you appear to be totally ignorant
eng_Latn she had a son born a few months subsequent to her escape.
eng_Latn a piece of boned fish which tasted delicious, dipped as it was in floury batter and fried in the smoking well of liquid fat along with the chips.
eng_Latn trying to catch the voice again
eng_Latn again, it was his fault that she was forever separated from her son.
eng_Latn Here we see the Foxton family doingtheir shopping.
eng_Latn I and all men have only one firm, incontestable, clear knowledge
eng_Latn she bought dictionaries, a grammar, and a supply of white paper.
eng_Latn that her caretaker did not realize she was dead until two hours later.
eng_Latn he may never feel certain of not losing himself again.
eng_Latn therefore had been applied to common use.
eng_Latn you must think it over.
eng_Latn your sister thinks so as well as I.
eng_Latn because I'm too insignificant to conquer the world.
eng_Latn although still warm and sunny.
eng_Latn has shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty sixth
eng_Latn he faltered mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes.
eng_Latn discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust it
eng_Latn on the contrary, now the fire seemed quenched in her, hidden somewhere far away.
eng_Latn but an inn keeper must browse wherefate has hitched him.
eng_Latn because he had not kneeled down in the rain
eng_Latn but something in her face made him decide not to.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowser! I know exactly what I'm going to make next!
eng_Latn though it was made with the hero himself.
eng_Latn He be even worse than the last time he was captain and I had to take over the ship.
eng_Latn I began to distinguish between tripe and not tripe.
eng_Latn I thought I'd just quickly make something up.
eng_Latn but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.
eng_Latn putting a stink bomb under your desk.
eng_Latn leave an eternalized fragment in a room.
eng_Latn I had a long think about it.
eng_Latn I would have gone in, but he stood in the way to prevent me passing.
eng_Latn I'll help ya if ya want,
eng_Latn I welcomed the opportunity.
eng_Latn but he had not gained his ship's side
eng_Latn as if it contained other worlds.
eng_Latn while the earth and sky were cool.
eng_Latn but of late years he had begun to think differently about it.
eng_Latn every season would bring rapid progress.
eng_Latn Wow the Owl, can you fly above theboxes and show us the way home?
eng_Latn moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle.
eng_Latn why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer
eng_Latn it would have been too much trouble.
eng_Latn he has not robbed or killed or murdered
eng_Latn I watched him too, through the keyhole, more than once.
eng_Latn no one of whom had troubled to communicate with him in any way
eng_Latn the world shall see that with thee reason has more influence than passion.
eng_Latn This playground looks a lot of fun.Is it yours, Janice?
eng_Latn The bookshop mice go on holiday?
eng_Latn but she thought it necessary for her brother's health.
eng_Latn I didn't realize I was a lesbian till I was thirty three
eng_Latn yellowish beard and hair
eng_Latn that I will take coffee with her
eng_Latn his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition'fully intelligible now'that her father had attached to their betrothal
eng_Latn had left the final battle of his life unfinished.
eng_Latn but he mustn't catch it yet
eng_Latn to look at the sky even at night
eng_Latn Sorry. I ve been a little busy.
eng_Latn nobody would fool around with a preacher anyway.
eng_Latn but inside all looked bright and cheerful.
eng_Latn to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning.
eng_Latn who looked stonily back.
eng_Latn a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay down in bed.
eng_Latn I could not doubt that
eng_Latn I can see a flutter all-a-flutter over there.
eng_Latn through the wood on the village and turn the enemy's position.
eng_Latn give her a shake like a dog shakes a rat.
eng_Latn took an enormous teapot from the shelf
eng_Latn that he should pay her more attention than he had done before.
eng_Latn I stare at her
eng_Latn that's what I've been leading up to.
eng_Latn he should be glad to hear of any thing that might deserve imitation.
eng_Latn So what was I thinking, wanting to be one of you???
eng_Latn I sighed and gave her the key.
eng_Latn ostensibly for services to industry, but in reality for secret contributions to party funds for the general election
eng_Latn each carrying a minute lamp of gold or green.
eng_Latn I am very glad I persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow,
eng_Latn she would make us some tea.
eng_Latn all of them, cheap and new.
eng_Latn If we solve the puzzles will we wina prize Granny?
eng_Latn consisting of about fifty men of war, and a great number of transports
eng_Latn sensuous force controlled by spiritual passion.
eng_Latn who waved back, grinning.
eng_Latn the grand mother dropped dead by the stable door.
eng_Latn but the solution of some question connected with them.
eng_Latn closed the ceremony without allowing any speeches.
eng_Latn the shoulder is just bandaged.
eng_Latn It's not a point I ve really pondered before Pug.
eng_Latn presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.
eng_Latn nor dragged through the streets
eng_Latn he was still not married, and was further than ever from marriage.
eng_Latn it was only a question of time and the mechanism itself would be destroyed.
eng_Latn that he frightened her so much her feet chattered on the floor
eng_Latn he locked himself in the bathroom and cried
eng_Latn they come from so many different distant provinces.
eng_Latn so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years
eng_Latn it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before.
eng_Latn except father and mother, there's everything!
eng_Latn let me see your pictures.
eng_Latn then kissed her sister, whose arms encircled her
eng_Latn the instrument was on one side, the performer on the other.
eng_Latn but instead she avoided passing through the villages of her nostalgia.
eng_Latn I really ought to break myself of the habit.
eng_Latn we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea.
eng_Latn so had found a safe hiding place for the creature.
eng_Latn It's my job to stop anyone crossing this bridge. But Ooh..
eng_Latn Then we need to make you warmer. Bookshop mice! Bookshop mices! Bring Dog s duvet!
eng_Latn he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it.
eng_Latn some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground.
eng_Latn but they're all layin' 'em down the same direction, jus' the same.
eng_Latn without a tombstone
eng_Latn suddenly let loose in a gentle, sunny, spacious and welcoming world.
eng_Latn he groped his way to the door
eng_Latn which, however, had no injurious effect upon his appetite
eng_Latn shiver my timbers
eng_Latn he told the canon what he proposed to do
eng_Latn seeing him fail a little.
eng_Latn again politely motioned me to get into bed
eng_Latn I've got a better idea.
eng_Latn I just'let her carry on a bit.
eng_Latn the skin of which is covered with a fine down.
eng_Latn with a sardonic giggle confirmed that this was so.
eng_Latn except for her brief honeymoon interlude, she had not had fun in so long.
eng_Latn It's alright Willow. No one snoticed.
eng_Latn I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your husband's winding.
eng_Latn would deserve, each of them, to have a sambenito put on it
eng_Latn a pack of tallow candles
eng_Latn where the queen was soon informed of what had passed
eng_Latn We did it
eng_Latn I have said that he had reason to fear us.
eng_Latn Look! More scary footprints!
eng_Latn I wouldn't say it to anyone else.
eng_Latn one is that of letters, the other that of arms.
eng_Latn growing confused, and constantly losing the thread of his ideas.
eng_Latn I'm not ashamed of myself as company for anybody.
eng_Latn here was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.
eng_Latn I provided the best substitute I could by dreaming of dragons until morning.
eng_Latn I know that you have even put up with having his wife around, which must have been a strain on you.
eng_Latn I loved him but he was so so thoughtless.
eng_Latn she threw her cheroot out of the window and went to bed.
eng_Latn they aren't so keen on showing their ignorance.
eng_Latn he expected to see her appear at all the corners of the paths
eng_Latn turning white at the mere suggestion.
eng_Latn to hear the old fashioned airs he liked.
eng_Latn one day, if I allow you to live
eng_Latn still it was pleasant to him to hear this now.
eng_Latn you'll see nothing to provoke you.
eng_Latn the truculent dirty old man with his wooden peg sticking stiffly out over the dashboard
eng_Latn I ambled along at a slow walk.
eng_Latn I bet he'd do anything to help you.
eng_Latn my august benefactor, I melt into tears!
eng_Latn you really ought to think about a nurse.
eng_Latn the price would be nice, very nice indeed.
eng_Latn consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle.
eng_Latn Let's do duvets!
eng_Latn my mother and sister.
eng_Latn I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!
eng_Latn turned in upon itself, and totally disappeared.
eng_Latn so we called a halt, and made our supper fires.
eng_Latn that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast.
eng_Latn because you are still four against one
eng_Latn I stride across the office and down the corridor to the meeting room
eng_Latn though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son
eng_Latn dressed in long white tunics
eng_Latn the boy had been one of his students last year.
eng_Latn went on perfecting the details
eng_Latn making peace before it could turn into a fight.
eng_Latn the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat down.
eng_Latn her life was shortened by trouble.
eng_Latn fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.
eng_Latn I can't move in with you.
eng_Latn down the dark little tunnel into the room at the front.
eng_Latn yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night.
eng_Latn but she drew her bonnet and her bandage closer about her face, and again beckoned me to depart.
eng_Latn I shall perish if you do not take me away.
eng_Latn it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer.
eng_Latn that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero.
eng_Latn ask you to your face what you had against me.
eng_Latn make no unworthy use of it, she said
eng_Latn I'm sorry you wasted the trip.
eng_Latn I had said it aloud.
eng_Latn maybe we could start out tomorrow or day after.
eng_Latn my clear duty was never for an instant to let him out of my sight.
eng_Latn by teaching us the first principles of honour, justice, truth, temperance, public spirit, fortitude, chastity, friendship, benevolence, and fidelity.
eng_Latn I wish they weren't real too.
eng_Latn it's no use now.
eng_Latn although he had never heard of the man before.
eng_Latn like children after a punishment or grown up people after a dreary, ceremonious reception
eng_Latn for the indifference was broken up.
eng_Latn yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.
eng_Latn I gave him a very short relation of my voyage
eng_Latn I think we only have five enemies to deal with.
eng_Latn but when they were seated at tea
eng_Latn he said vaguely.
eng_Latn I don't know what's the matter with you.
eng_Latn many will have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end.
eng_Latn Dog?
eng_Latn I will give you the signal
eng_Latn with many matters waiting on account of the pressure of this particular case
eng_Latn rather to be circumspect in the future
eng_Latn but now it has turned out vicious and lamed itself.
eng_Latn Because the world may be full of noise and distractions, but we can always find peace within.
eng_Latn I darted through the door, pulling it shut behind me.
eng_Latn Hmm. This is something I must look into.
eng_Latn he had a slight mechanical turn
eng_Latn whom he had utterly forgotten to call upon.
eng_Latn It's on of a stick?
eng_Latn thanks to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered
eng_Latn getting mixed up with these wizarding types ' just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end
eng_Latn returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief
eng_Latn he had to jog to keep up.
eng_Latn it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance
eng_Latn I'm sure many girls would be very envious of your career.
eng_Latn for whom he was ready to ruin himself, and has ruined himself, and who cannot live without him.
eng_Latn I nursed her, poor thing!
eng_Latn stretching his legs toward the stove.
eng_Latn as though by automatic action.
eng_Latn if he is not there, bring the note back to me.
eng_Latn Oh I do like to be beside theseaside Dog. Where s the ice cream van?
eng_Latn we will pray and go together.
eng_Latn I've never seen his sitting room when it wasn't dim with pipe smoke.
eng_Latn I've got a fellow coming to see me early to morrow.
eng_Latn she waited while he used the key she handed him
eng_Latn I should do it just to teach the stupid idiot a lesson.
eng_Latn to see what it was that made his head feel so cool
eng_Latn even in her despair, she was glad.
eng_Latn from whose discretion and courtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.
eng_Latn very quickly this time she felt the electricity beginning to flow inside her head
eng_Latn made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture
eng_Latn I'm the man who speaks for the latter age
eng_Latn this gentleman doesn't want to remain in my company or else he'd come at once.
eng_Latn she was permitted to see her son in a room entirely apart from theold death house.
eng_Latn dimly I could remember the passage as it used to be
eng_Latn nor yet can I give her what she asks
eng_Latn which, being itself nicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour
eng_Latn I'd been standing with her and then pulled her out of the way till her eager listeners got bored and stopped looking for more details.
eng_Latn he might put me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke.
eng_Latn who struck him as being a man of intelligence.
eng_Latn for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud voice
eng_Latn Now the bookshop mice are asking Why? a lot too!
eng_Latn then, closing the window, sat down again upon the sill.
eng_Latn I'll leave in the morning.
eng_Latn the arms flung above his head with the fists clenched, a hand laid flat upon the heart
eng_Latn I pushed the plate of food back towards her pizza, I realized wondering how best to begin.
eng_Latn tosses her long blond hair back
eng_Latn but to getting into conversation with her.
eng_Latn I relocking the vacant drawer.
eng_Latn but then the screen flickers.
eng_Latn ready to pounce upon the old lady at the first words of condemnation.
eng_Latn No! Dragons are wild creatures, not pets
eng_Latn out of her dumb, fear distorted face.
eng_Latn as though to avoid meeting her eyes.
eng_Latn he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.
eng_Latn But we like fried chicken Mum.
eng_Latn he believed what was told him, did not care to find out more, and went to his own room.
eng_Latn I am very glad you have changed it very very.
eng_Latn the better sort, who could afford it, crowded for warmth and merriment to the city.
eng_Latn the friend whose life was delivered into his!
eng_Latn eave us alone for a moment.
eng_Latn filled it with powder
eng_Latn to be the most conscientious man in the world
eng_Latn I know I can't keep him forever
eng_Latn You know who d be fun to inviteDog?
eng_Latn but I feel it so deeply that I'll tell you what I think.
eng_Latn I smiled gently as I wondered whether or not she had fallen in the ocean.
eng_Latn Let me take you on an amazingadventure into the wondrous world of marvellous creatures just a few feet from your feet...
eng_Latn there were some half dozen persons, and one of these was bending close over a manuscript
eng_Latn but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him.
eng_Latn her head covered
eng_Latn I LOVE BOOKS THAT CARRY ME AWAY TO SOMEWHERE PEACEFUL AND QUIET!!!!
eng_Latn knowing her fate and powerless to avoid it.
eng_Latn I said I should be delighted to see her.
eng_Latn as something I have passed, rather than have actually been and almost think of him as of someone else.
eng_Latn the murderer, finding that he was not followed
eng_Latn to remind me and recall what she then did,
eng_Latn I'd better tell you the whole truth.
eng_Latn as the ship was now, in a sense, my own
eng_Latn for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that
eng_Latn And that concludes our wildlifesafari.
eng_Latn her bonnet askew
eng_Latn though that of poetry is less useful than pleasurable
eng_Latn moreover active, and kind to the poor
eng_Latn waded till I came within a hundred yards off the boat
eng_Latn compared the questions he made with the answers I had given.
eng_Latn such is the law of nature.
eng_Latn while the person who had let them in
eng_Latn if I search a year.
eng_Latn drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.
eng_Latn I should like very much to see her once more.
eng_Latn looking and listening eagerly
eng_Latn gave me a full account of what we are all driving at.
eng_Latn she had never been fully conscious of the weight and size of the drama that she had provoked
eng_Latn was lying stretched before us.
eng_Latn We can see because of the moon.
eng_Latn 1 to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation
eng_Latn strewing some heath under me
eng_Latn where I saw many labourers working with several sorts of tools in the ground
eng_Latn I started, or rather was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one and twenty
eng_Latn if I can repay them in avenging you of any arrogant foe who may have wronged you,
eng_Latn now he won't have those splendid provinces.
eng_Latn indeed, he was not yet certain that the grim, sneering stranger was his father.
eng_Latn But sometimes It's more fun imagining what happened than actually finding out!
eng_Latn evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might.
eng_Latn one saw that all to him was void darkness.
eng_Latn I ve never see somethings like youbefore.
eng_Latn And so the king who only looked at himself began to see others instead. And for the kind deeds that followed was more fondly remembered than any king in a portrait.
eng_Latn I never said I was leaving.
eng_Latn We re very high in the sky Dog!
eng_Latn twenty four male domestics sat in his halls
eng_Latn left her by herself to follow as she had proposed.
eng_Latn we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on board
eng_Latn except that of coming across some vessel out on a roving expedition.
eng_Latn There s a bit where Mrs Hargûşa Şîrîneloses her carrots.
eng_Latn as she had done before and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again
eng_Latn you ain't well a bit
eng_Latn saying he was wanted at the counting house.
eng_Latn prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made.
eng_Latn the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight
eng_Latn I don't believe I shall ever do much good as a painter.
eng_Latn for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked.
eng_Latn when I spied a very small island about half a league off
eng_Latn Quick grab a parachute and head for the turbine
eng_Latn some poor creeter came a beggin', and your ma went straight off to see what was needed.
eng_Latn I lie in bed, my heart hammering, going over it again and again.
eng_Latn though hehad never spoken to her
eng_Latn but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation
eng_Latn A fellow painter, eh?
eng_Latn a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school.
eng_Latn hooked the handle of the bucket on to the end of it.
eng_Latn he glanced down at her, and at once fell a prey to distress, incertitude, and fear.
eng_Latn I was the third of five sons.
eng_Latn that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,and that they were to have a tete a tete drive.
eng_Latn My books!
eng_Latn the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major
eng_Latn that credit at present was dead and buried.
eng_Latn it would amount to my simply trying to gain a certain sham reputation by such a challenge.
eng_Latn so that it would not be too obvious that it was really a document of love.
eng_Latn thinking you'd be discharged, and it would serve you right!
eng_Latn because my principal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.
eng_Latn the chemist whistled softly, as he read it.
eng_Latn taking the grass grown path by which we had come.
eng_Latn I was on the point of opening the door and leaving my grateful but confused medical friend to himself and his shame
eng_Latn to which a band of zinc had beennailed by way of dressing.
eng_Latn Er, what exactly are they doing now Pug?
eng_Latn most of the school seemed to be packed beneath it
eng_Latn one single soldier left behind
eng_Latn vehemently and repeatedly denied that he had.
eng_Latn hastily closing the window shutter of the room into which it led
eng_Latn the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart.
eng_Latn then, she had reached herfierce stage of devotion.
eng_Latn his wounded arm forgotten, thoughts of suicide forgotten.
eng_Latn she promised to lend it whenever I want one.
eng_Latn only now, for the first time, he wasliving it for himself.
eng_Latn though the attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half his men.
eng_Latn took' and kept'her hand in both his own.
eng_Latn I can drill a dime at fifty yards.
eng_Latn We d love to be of assistance.
eng_Latn I should esteem it the happiest good fortune.
eng_Latn I always will, I suppose.
eng_Latn delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of their great abilities if I could be brought to converse with them.
eng_Latn such as any other country would be under the necessity of enacting, in the like circumstances.
eng_Latn I hope you have a family business
eng_Latn she burst into a paroxysm of sobs
eng_Latn my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened.
eng_Latn I do hope Pug is learning someuseful painting taps...I mean tips.
eng_Latn placing himself between his wife and the door.
eng_Latn he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle
eng_Latn whom she had seen last in the days of the siege.
eng_Latn at the little bit of wax candle she kept for her thread
eng_Latn to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.
eng_Latn I am the last man to withhold my vote
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat might tell us.
eng_Latn you know, I'm not your boss.
eng_Latn but he had failed to transmute it.
eng_Latn but all the weary submission had gone out of his face.
eng_Latn I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this legend.
eng_Latn would, perhaps, have given him the world likewise.
eng_Latn for why should I not confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter
eng_Latn I sealed the letter, and dispatched it by the hand of a corridor lacquey, with orders to hand it to the addressee in person.
eng_Latn knows he can trust me, see.
eng_Latn I shall depend upon a most particular description of it.
eng_Latn 1830 is a revolution arrested midway.
eng_Latn he smiled,pitying her.
eng_Latn of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows
eng_Latn who was young and for whom he would have to put on only a small show.
eng_Latn he has fared hard, and worked hard to make good everybody's loss.
eng_Latn Give me a number nine Baz.
eng_Latn though, to my sorrow, there was no grazing here
eng_Latn written without his father's knowledge, and that letter persuaded him to return.
eng_Latn the guard guy of the truck rabbed him
eng_Latn I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a few words.
eng_Latn to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible
eng_Latn she was in no mood to compel him to do other than he wished.
eng_Latn it did me good!
eng_Latn mysterious gesture no one understood
eng_Latn but I do know that she does not behave this way to hurt you.
eng_Latn I wasn't in a very good mood
eng_Latn I wasn't very good at it.
eng_Latn a frightfully grand woman!
eng_Latn This isn t a beach Pug.
eng_Latn Dog, I can see Canis Major!
eng_Latn half in the table's shadow and half out.
eng_Latn I can't stand waiting anymore.
eng_Latn marry me now.
eng_Latn but the pleasure she had felt on other days was gone today
eng_Latn a yeti with a head cold
eng_Latn so it went, the inexorable elimination of the superfluous.
eng_Latn it was like giving him the land
eng_Latn he asked them, whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces as themselves?
eng_Latn that the young girl's heart was filled with gratitude.
eng_Latn but he adopted the people.
eng_Latn until it had my shape instead of his.
eng_Latn which was admirably arranged for sleeping in
eng_Latn where you see one of them blue lights flickering around
eng_Latn where he had better go and try to live.
eng_Latn although he was at last undeceived and reconciled to her
eng_Latn but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the letter
eng_Latn brought out her work box to her own table in the open window
eng_Latn some sudden catastrophe had occurred, and that he was almost the cause of it, because he had read the article aloud.
eng_Latn lest they should be attacked by some giant or other malevolent scoundrel
eng_Latn I come back and look around the quiet office
eng_Latn assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well.
eng_Latn regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.
eng_Latn It looks more like holey island.
eng_Latn Something you really need.
eng_Latn I welcomed the opportunity to examine him at my ease.
eng_Latn which moved slowly upward as the doors closed behind him
eng_Latn Again! Again!
eng_Latn Now I can go back to my woodwork, Dog. Hmmm...I wonder if I can make some wooden electricity?
eng_Latn probably because the captives possess teeth
eng_Latn after five months continuance, came back with a very little smattering in mathematics
eng_Latn I tried to picture her in the sun on the beach.
eng_Latn assured her that he was not comparing.
eng_Latn just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can.
eng_Latn perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man
eng_Latn Tell me about it.
eng_Latn they all watched her run up the marble staircase.
eng_Latn with a page, whom I was very fond of
eng_Latn her lifetime dream.
eng_Latn as he closed the box and returned it to his pocket while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated inn keeper
eng_Latn I never even looked for where they were venting the tank!
eng_Latn or put the phony certificate to a government, with his name and guarantee backing it up.
eng_Latn Does it have any cream cakes or lashings of fizzy pop?
eng_Latn on which he rested his elbows, looking dejectedly before him.
eng_Latn there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary
eng_Latn as well as fear of his own word given to the officials abovehim
eng_Latn now had opened a bakery downtown.
eng_Latn Dog.
eng_Latn I know exactly all that went on, in every detail, and why things have turned out as they have.
eng_Latn or a human being of some new species or unearthly breed.
eng_Latn not quite certain.
eng_Latn I think I have served you faithfully.
eng_Latn she gave her neck a meditative turn
eng_Latn though I may wish it unsaid the next moment.
eng_Latn I heard him go as I stood at the half open door of my own room, to which I had now withdrawn.
eng_Latn I had no right to ask.
eng_Latn I'm sure I'm not doing this the way you expect.
eng_Latn better distemper and tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer book!
eng_Latn he spoke to her
eng_Latn I made two wills on purpose.
eng_Latn faced by a man whom he considered dumb, one
eng_Latn Well pointed Pug.
eng_Latn but inside there was a harmony of beauty
eng_Latn I've been down there a couple of years living on the climate.
eng_Latn And Dog stacked books ready for the Grand Opening.
eng_Latn the fact that theunintentional blow still had had anger in it angry dissatisfactionwith her really
eng_Latn she was leaner and more graceful, her proportions were more even, like an adult's.
eng_Latn she assured me she would not complain.
eng_Latn his voice even sadder than I remembered.
eng_Latn being kept a close prisoner in my cabin
eng_Latn they whispered to one another
eng_Latn the ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight
eng_Latn but I know something about this thousand dollar watch.
eng_Latn Not moving?
eng_Latn that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here
eng_Latn so that when grown up they may be the staff of their parents' old age
eng_Latn I'm glad you possess a consolation
eng_Latn this time there was no homework to finish or egg to eat.
eng_Latn the gay tones set my heart at ease.
eng_Latn but the boy felt it, and did not respond with a smile to his father's chilly smile.
eng_Latn what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east.
eng_Latn she endeavoured not to be uneasy
eng_Latn seizing about eight at a time
eng_Latn from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was general.
eng_Latn beside me she had seemed tall and gaunt, but she looked shrunken now in size, more wizened
eng_Latn he murmured, and fell with his face to the ground.
eng_Latn I have about ten dollars myself.
eng_Latn to send me wherever it may be most to his service
eng_Latn so he made after him to ask it.
eng_Latn easing his sword in the scabbard
eng_Latn I trembled, and turned white.
eng_Latn abandoned her to her fate.
eng_Latn I arrived the same day at two in the afternoon
eng_Latn to day her delirium is almost madness
eng_Latn Yes Dog. But now I'm going YIPPPPP!
eng_Latn I can't possibly keep them.
eng_Latn immediately upon your death five or six thousand of his majesty's subjects might, in two or three days, cut your flesh from your bones.
eng_Latn when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand
eng_Latn He explored this cave a long time ago and took that path to The Centre Of The Earth!
eng_Latn he stopped short.
eng_Latn we must often take some.
eng_Latn humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted proper words
eng_Latn I am not exactly thanking you
eng_Latn she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts.
eng_Latn to consult with him to act, and to aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels.
eng_Latn but the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.
eng_Latn the dawn was in the sky
eng_Latn her sandal wood box which I am so fond of plenty of things.
eng_Latn she sent a man over to try to get hold of me.
eng_Latn another poured ice white foam so thick
eng_Latn she had very early made up her mind to his incapacity of minding his own interests
eng_Latn lest they should recall or bring back to his recollection what had taken place.
eng_Latn as it was once proposed.
eng_Latn I heard the music and wanted to join the party because, you see, I love to dance...
eng_Latn resolved merely to keep himself always before him
eng_Latn she began to stand out against the scenery instead of blending into it.
eng_Latn I sort of set it free without meaning to
eng_Latn made her sit down on the bed.
eng_Latn I can't prevent that.
eng_Latn upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown.
eng_Latn but I should like to know in case the time of favours should not come, and it might be necessary to fall back upon wages
eng_Latn I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting
eng_Latn although in fact this is a leftover from colonial days and five years out of date.
eng_Latn I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person.
eng_Latn I was badly bred.
eng_Latn was as kind and hearty
eng_Latn therefore I had better stop.
eng_Latn I tell you that you buried paving stones and earth in that there coffin.
eng_Latn that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton.
eng_Latn he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him.
eng_Latn but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty thousand a year that's clean wasted upon him.
eng_Latn one of the partners in the highly respectable firm.
eng_Latn I regret your suffering more than you realize.
eng_Latn so well disguised, that if I did not carry his image graven on my heart it would have been impossible for me to recognise him.
eng_Latn I can no more help talking about them
eng_Latn perhaps the most unnatural to the claims of your own family.
eng_Latn why didn't you tell me that that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?
eng_Latn that the raftsmen were all down at the village
eng_Latn that will take her life the first time he detects her in an impropriety?
eng_Latn she could feel that apart from being moderately glad to see her again
eng_Latn that felt obliged to pay tribute to the memory of their illustrious patron
eng_Latn he flattered himself, that a more noble, exalted thought never sprang in any other man's head.
eng_Latn the doors were propped open to let in the balmy air.
eng_Latn then turned and stumbled out.
eng_Latn so prepared the way for his own death.
eng_Latn I thought it better to inquire from you personally to save any misunderstanding.
eng_Latn rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling.
eng_Latn SNARK! SNARK! Come out and let me hunt you!
eng_Latn but he recalled the walk often just the same
eng_Latn Well this is as good a place as any to get started.
eng_Latn three minutes had not elapsed when the men made theirappearance.
eng_Latn I think that means this is a pirateship Pug - and here comes a pirate.
eng_Latn every way expanded to the breeze.
eng_Latn she is not likely to go visiting on such a day.
eng_Latn I don't know how the government arranges that
eng_Latn I should be in a curious taking if I surrendered my heart to that young person, and the daughter turned out a second edition of the mother.
eng_Latn I have only one aim in the world.
eng_Latn even as the woods had done.
eng_Latn pool was very clear water and immensely deep.
eng_Latn which showed he understood his business.
eng_Latn but he held her hand.
eng_Latn NOW are you satisfied?
eng_Latn the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
eng_Latn his rifle close by his right hand.
eng_Latn for sixty paper roubles, and hiring a free servant to take her place.
eng_Latn Fear not, young puglet. I wilst save you.
eng_Latn but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods,
eng_Latn she had to stoop low to get through the doorway.
eng_Latn shiver my timbers
eng_Latn I cannot say what an impression this made upon me
eng_Latn I was forced to meet him again at supper.
eng_Latn to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.
eng_Latn sinking his teeth into it, surging and wrestling with it.
eng_Latn between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store.
eng_Latn I am old, and, no doubt, have not much longer to live.
eng_Latn who was less corpulent than his father
eng_Latn goingt' cut down my fool smoking.
eng_Latn Poetry is all very well for those who have nothing to say.
eng_Latn the general has been killed
eng_Latn especially when that little girl was her favorite child.
eng_Latn just ready to engage.
eng_Latn then crashed to the ground on his head and chest.
eng_Latn a great readiness to be pleased with other people.
eng_Latn but now tell me, who was the first tumbler in the world?
eng_Latn that I bowed down to the ground for that money!
eng_Latn you just tried to lend a hand.
eng_Latn they both turned away to hide their laughter
eng_Latn his young wife was on a stool at his feet.
eng_Latn when he came to speak of the sonnets
eng_Latn that the old man attached great importance to an oath
eng_Latn the squandering of time in the enormous, windowless rooms.
eng_Latn there's enough of that sort of talk.
eng_Latn therefore we should have been mutually guilty in any case.
eng_Latn I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder
eng_Latn since to fill the church was always the most difficult part of a clergyman's function
eng_Latn I had not eaten.
eng_Latn for, remember, he has no gills.
eng_Latn that's what I've been leading up to.
eng_Latn Now you have a friend.
eng_Latn hearing something snap in his verist.
eng_Latn made a hollow resonance perfectly audible in the kitchen.
eng_Latn I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.
eng_Latn I saw what he meant, and for a moment the room swam around me.
eng_Latn no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing.
eng_Latn still compact and in close ranks, mounting ata full trot
eng_Latn then it is all so different from what you have always been.
eng_Latn it was another effect of the damp
eng_Latn forgetful of the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for fourteen hours.
eng_Latn I'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain
eng_Latn bought their freedom one by one or ran away
eng_Latn finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I should stay.
eng_Latn knew a sense of his own purpose
eng_Latn remarkably well tended for a farmer's hands.
eng_Latn but instead of writing she clasped her hands on the table, and, laying her head on them
eng_Latn there was not enough difference between them and others.
eng_Latn but I began to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and cold.
eng_Latn THE next morning we fell early to work
eng_Latn a quiet sea.
eng_Latn who looked like an underfed vulture.
eng_Latn another thought struck me.
eng_Latn but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft.
eng_Latn that he had conferred a great boon upon us by unselfishly doing it.
eng_Latn with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man.
eng_Latn she took his arm in a clinging, snuggling embrace and measured her stride to his.
eng_Latn dumplings for supper!
eng_Latn it is because your father would inherit your property
eng_Latn Meow meow meow ow ow oh meow !
eng_Latn I say to myself that it is quite impossible that the future should separate you.
eng_Latn with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.
eng_Latn there was the more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted into a mere question of salary.
eng_Latn has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross?
eng_Latn but it never materially varied.
eng_Latn at least has been destroyed by time or public disturbances.
eng_Latn And all at sea Pug.
eng_Latn I should have thought he might find some less horrible way than that.
eng_Latn had been the soul and body of her social paradise for almost forty years.
eng_Latn I seen you say no
eng_Latn on two occasions a glass of fine wine.
eng_Latn That s amazing Dog...
eng_Latn the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past.
eng_Latn thence turned to the left
eng_Latn it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing
eng_Latn she might be taken away from him
eng_Latn he turned away, thinking perhaps there had been an impertinent look in his eyes.
eng_Latn uddenly blazed up like an exploding pine knot and then subsided just as quickly.
eng_Latn let it turn brown and eat it to cure this condition.
eng_Latn hard earned savings and indulging in a suit of this kind.
eng_Latn I am going right ahead.
eng_Latn for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.
eng_Latn I'll just have a look at the son and heir and then I'll take myself off.
eng_Latn ALL UNICORNS ARE STARS, SO YOU MUSTCROSS THIS STINKY GUNGE ON THESE WOBBLY STONES!
eng_Latn BE a sport and let us in!
eng_Latn but that they should be removed
eng_Latn without any regard to time or other circumstances, while I strictly adhere to truth.
eng_Latn I do not believe.
eng_Latn I didn't set out to use you.
eng_Latn I heard a car pull into the driveway and straightened up.
eng_Latn that she needed a woollen skirt, and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this.
eng_Latn which fell on it snapping and biting at each other jealously.
eng_Latn I'd hate to see a brother of mine in on anysuch game.
eng_Latn likely very expensive and unfriendly to such an immoral adventure as this
eng_Latn let them now say that drama is unnatural!
eng_Latn the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject.
eng_Latn but a new soul with unsuspected powers.
eng_Latn he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel
eng_Latn I can see another something.
eng_Latn I'm the oldest woman in these parts, I guess, and I still make m'own biscuit.
eng_Latn is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed.
eng_Latn I tried to stay calm, to not panic.
eng_Latn in a gaze totally devoid of the deference she was accustomed to.
eng_Latn was trying to teach him the latest dance steps.
eng_Latn began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner
eng_Latn but for fear that horse might turn restive in the company of my mare.
eng_Latn he made him his theme.
eng_Latn in my natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side door and got away.
eng_Latn the colonel and his officers were in much pain.
eng_Latn but all in a somewhat decayed condition
eng_Latn replies another triumphantly, and passes on with an air of pride.
eng_Latn everything came into focus again
eng_Latn but she has better sense than you are aware of
eng_Latn I have never seen or heard tell of one so fair.
eng_Latn he paused, than to have a good sleep.
eng_Latn any time I want, it does a fella good to cuss if he wants to.
eng_Latn but her husband wasn't with her, and he didn't come in by plane or ferry.
eng_Latn I am delighted to meet a compatriot.
eng_Latn Don t be alarmed Pug. I am sure this one will work out well in...
eng_Latn but that did not prevent her from inveigling other men into asking to marry her.
eng_Latn I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner.
eng_Latn but the victims had to be gullible.
eng_Latn she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity and loyalty towards her husband.
eng_Latn he's not a critic at all.
eng_Latn thrusting his hands through his hair in such a manner
eng_Latn so that his head would be whirling with the conflict and contradiction of ideas.
eng_Latn Aggh! Cheese. CHEESE! CHEEEEESE! Dogs don t like cheese.
eng_Latn Dog! Come back!
eng_Latn realized what he had done, and retraced his steps, stopping in front of it.
eng_Latn but error is worthy of veneration there, so thoroughly does it imply heroism.
eng_Latn but I would have nothing to do with it.
eng_Latn especially after she had abandoned herself to him, his thoughts ran.
eng_Latn in trying to observe the principles I have spoken of
eng_Latn walked to the front door.
eng_Latn bearing on its wide top several lamps and a long row of candles in candlesticks.
eng_Latn looked attentively at her and assumed an extremely dignified
eng_Latn looped her easily, and caught it again.
eng_Latn you were so good that I can't help coming to you again.
eng_Latn the great rogue and rascal that my master and I freed from the chain.
eng_Latn I saw him come into the room
eng_Latn one held the light
eng_Latn followed by his wife
eng_Latn I gazed steadily at my plate.
eng_Latn on the contrary, that change can only intensify love in his heart.
eng_Latn double his feed
eng_Latn And find out what happens next!
eng_Latn I took it very carefully in my arms.
eng_Latn I will do whatever is necessary
eng_Latn I must and shall!
eng_Latn but the dark had no answer for her
eng_Latn but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin.
eng_Latn his name and crime entered in the books himselfassigned to two assistants, who saw to it that
eng_Latn he had to go around like that for a week.
eng_Latn so I guess I better make sure you're not going to die on his hands.
eng_Latn I should be perfectly happy except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon.
eng_Latn avarice is growing with him a besetting sin.
eng_Latn I hate to wait
eng_Latn he looked at him
eng_Latn sitting perfectly upright, with her hands folded on one knee, and looking grimly on the speaker.
eng_Latn Granny Pug s Guide To The Stars.
eng_Latn indeed it had become difficult for them to continue walking abreast.
eng_Latn there is no more life for me and will be no more time!
eng_Latn she asked defiantly.
eng_Latn the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire
eng_Latn he learned all there was to know about the different forms of cholera
eng_Latn saw that it was nearly eleven hundred
eng_Latn I'll bring it in.
eng_Latn I could not stand it any longer.
eng_Latn it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.
eng_Latn smooth of cheek and obviously becurled as to hair, who now came over and in his closely
eng_Latn but my wife will not have it in the drawing room.
eng_Latn although each of us for himself and all of us together felt confident that
eng_Latn I thought'well, I thought maybe we could all go in town
eng_Latn decided to return to his master.
eng_Latn he noticed that they connected these scientific questions with those spiritual problems, that at times they almost touched on the latter.
eng_Latn their whiteness was nearly dazzling against his tanned skin
eng_Latn I am under his orders for the next month.
eng_Latn so insidious is the repetition of any scene
eng_Latn what an enormous perspective I make of it!
eng_Latn A lovely place to sit.
eng_Latn their eyes met again, and he disappeared.
eng_Latn laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before.
eng_Latn I left it to get riches
eng_Latn yellowing in some places and disappearing altogether in others
eng_Latn but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform.
eng_Latn the address was written in emerald green ink.
eng_Latn getting mixed up with these wizarding types ' just what I expected, always knew they'd come to a sticky end
eng_Latn we were permitted to sit on three stools, near the lowest step of his highness's throne.
eng_Latn Oh...Oh...
eng_Latn for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket.
eng_Latn who, I conceived, would read it in a rather strong voice
eng_Latn she filled on the port tack and was off again
eng_Latn then, adjusting his belt, he went into the churchyard.
eng_Latn I could not sleep.
eng_Latn I reckon he'll know your name soon.
eng_Latn I heard a noise over the purr of the engine, coming from the forest behind us.
eng_Latn he was therefore its first mayor
eng_Latn then, maybe, I'll be so dumb that I'll not say a word until the end of the world, or, at least, till the day of judgment.
eng_Latn as we said
eng_Latn I had never seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so.
eng_Latn I suppose everybody must be always just a little homesick.
eng_Latn How curious. I must have opened thebook of Fairy Tales at the wrong page.
eng_Latn that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,and that they were to have a tete a tete drive.
eng_Latn it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about
eng_Latn now, in a burst ofhumanity, advised her to return to her husband.
eng_Latn asked the visitor
eng_Latn I'm just a twitterin' to go on.
eng_Latn fall, leaped from his horse
eng_Latn at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet.
eng_Latn but at least his eyes had lost that awful dead fish look.
eng_Latn It's fine Mr Troll! Come across –
eng_Latn he would understand it, and bear it.
eng_Latn it had been decided that the marriage should take place within six weeks.
eng_Latn was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance.
eng_Latn he became disoriented
eng_Latn the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this
eng_Latn I can t wait to tell MY readers.
eng_Latn yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.
eng_Latn I laughed at the whining tone she put on.
eng_Latn I never even looked for where they were venting the tank!
eng_Latn a prison plot, and that it will involve her life'and perhaps her child's'and perhaps her father's
eng_Latn but this truck was the active thing, the living principle.
eng_Latn but he had a beautiful fresh colour
eng_Latn Can I see please?
eng_Latn at least she thought so.
eng_Latn that gazing on it, in that full front view
eng_Latn I think it would be much better if you stayed who you are. You do it really well.
eng_Latn I left the menu on the desk as usual,' she said.
eng_Latn everybody knows that.
eng_Latn because it was so intended when the device was first introduced.
eng_Latn I do business with him from time to time.
eng_Latn all he had to do now was to close his hand.
eng_Latn but not smiling any longer, and walking very softly, almost on tip toes, to the door, he opened it, went out, and shut it behind him.
eng_Latn it is hard lines that we have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our own prisoner.
eng_Latn you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it.
eng_Latn I told him to stop and lay the table.
eng_Latn under the same banner, to join in the same enterprise.
eng_Latn I am not so ungrateful nor so grasping
eng_Latn never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.
eng_Latn only looked down at her feet.
eng_Latn found him lying on his face
eng_Latn stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
eng_Latn I'm not sure. I pleaded with her to talk to you about it.
eng_Latn to and fro in his mind till it gathered shape or momentum to his liking.
eng_Latn but hooted softly in a reassuring sort of way all the same.
eng_Latn but I have little time for reading.
eng_Latn cranked up, and drove off.
eng_Latn with his right he picked up hiscudgel, which was lying on the ground.
eng_Latn let each look out for the arrow
eng_Latn as though to avoid meeting her eyes.
eng_Latn I do hope nothing is broken Pug?
eng_Latn who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them.
eng_Latn Now I ve upset a tree.
eng_Latn an ordinary stockman, stealing her from under their noses!
eng_Latn speckled with beings greater than gods.
eng_Latn I will hold my tongue and leave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say
eng_Latn I will go and tell my mistress.
eng_Latn Granny Pug! How delightful!
eng_Latn Many stars are suns Pug, butthey re a long way away.
eng_Latn the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been.
eng_Latn It sounds like she s in trouble.
eng_Latn try to cope with the dust and the flies and the stink.
eng_Latn I'll stake my reputation on that.
eng_Latn I spread my arms with a blissful smile and sink down onto a chair.
eng_Latn no two parts of which were of one precise shade
eng_Latn which will have forty guns in all directed against it.
eng_Latn but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there.
eng_Latn which were uttered and made by the men on the mares
eng_Latn I wonder if we should send a formal announcement to the police?
eng_Latn I heard what you said about my dog!
eng_Latn till she found her arm drawn within his, and pressed against his heart
eng_Latn I don't understand.
eng_Latn with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.
eng_Latn I'm busy now.
eng_Latn I won't think about it now.
eng_Latn there were even those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference.
eng_Latn I wondered why she hated him so much.
eng_Latn the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied
eng_Latn but it's all laid out for 'im an' there's on'y one way to do it.
eng_Latn I stared at his face while I recovered, recognizing another change there.
eng_Latn but this time he had a girl with him.
eng_Latn I went looking for you at the bookstore I saw in her head.
eng_Latn then the horror of utter darkness reigned!
eng_Latn with the old man among them.
eng_Latn all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.
eng_Latn the price he had now sold me for.
eng_Latn but still she was intending to come if she could.
eng_Latn you won't get it for the wage you're offering.
eng_Latn but in it he saw that same teasing light as when she had called him dummy it was not a twinkle but a hard mirthless shine.
eng_Latn afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin which he took out of his sleeve
eng_Latn for she had received proposals from nearly all the young men in the neighborhood
eng_Latn I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer's basket.
eng_Latn that with one consent we all agreed to tell him the whole truth of the matter
eng_Latn this is the kitchen
eng_Latn all the daimons struggling within him, all of whom had an equal right to live.
eng_Latn there is no need to ask permission.
eng_Latn my master would have been content with giving me one or two dozen lashes
eng_Latn when you might have fainted and had a miscarriage.
eng_Latn perhaps, have boarded her judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions
eng_Latn I cleared my throat.
eng_Latn Don t worry Pug. I ll find you.
eng_Latn joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.
eng_Latn I intend to try.
eng_Latn his majesty resolving, if possible, to spare your life
eng_Latn I also am a prisoner of the healers.
eng_Latn to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret.
eng_Latn he vowed, and hetried to make it valiant.
eng_Latn his inspection finished, he placed the key in the lock.
eng_Latn I can hear her voice now.
eng_Latn command them to answer any questions I should think fit to ask
eng_Latn I'll see to it personally.
eng_Latn his daughter had followed him
eng_Latn as if he had been standing at the altar with her.
eng_Latn took the side of the workers.
eng_Latn when earthquakes caused the beach to gape.
eng_Latn Yay! We did it!
eng_Latn then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty.
eng_Latn I knew it wasn't a mistake to come!
eng_Latn but not with him.
eng_Latn he was left to think of some other way.
eng_Latn always somebody to give orders
eng_Latn so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a fork.
eng_Latn but in every other way he looked more like a young man than a schoolboy.
eng_Latn but I know neither the street nor the number
eng_Latn Perhaps we could look after it for you?
eng_Latn I made several attempts to get out of their way
eng_Latn then struck through the woods, following the shore
eng_Latn I don' know if I'm the right person ter tell yeh ' but someone's gotta
eng_Latn here he showed more audacity than most
eng_Latn I want to know what's going on.
eng_Latn saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed.
eng_Latn so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dollars a month.
eng_Latn Yo Dog. I'm down with this.
eng_Latn the past was better than what we have now.
eng_Latn for this is one of the cases where the truth does not exist.
eng_Latn only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,
eng_Latn they will have good reason to be proud of you.
eng_Latn to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.
eng_Latn but here the guards were alert.
eng_Latn I know a better book Pug... Snoozing in a big chair for beginners.
eng_Latn unless the wife takes care to provide a healthy father, among her neighbours or domestics
eng_Latn I know where we can go for supper.
eng_Latn Take my paw Pug! Wooh.
eng_Latn I don t know Dog, but it does look fun.
eng_Latn for if I yield it up in the presence of my beloved husband
eng_Latn with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence
eng_Latn but I was already out the door.
eng_Latn but he was wrong
eng_Latn how I longed to follow it farther!
eng_Latn I don't wonder at it.
eng_Latn but she and her husband were so busy that I couldn't get to speak to her.
eng_Latn he groped his way to the door
eng_Latn I had as I deserved to have the fate of all other spoonies.
eng_Latn Hello Pug. Hello Dog. Welcome tothe Himalayas. I was hoping my cry might attract the Yeti so I could take it's photograph. But it's nice to see you too.
eng_Latn so, going up to him,
eng_Latn but had not said this
eng_Latn I have seen it very cruel to some of our men.
eng_Latn But the soup still won t cool down and I'm really hungry!
eng_Latn but restores to him his fortune and his possessions
eng_Latn for their sake was it shed, to quench their ravening thirst.
eng_Latn with them some of those who were present.
eng_Latn I understood this for what is was offence as the best defense.
eng_Latn he was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe.
eng_Latn four of them in steaming hot water and sixty seconds under a stream of ice cold.
eng_Latn except when I spoke to the man who had taught it to me.
eng_Latn You meddled with my map Max?
eng_Latn thus make the disorder of his pulmonary functions a general benefit to society.
eng_Latn my mind is too fond of wandering on its own way.
eng_Latn now that it is daylight I count upon finding them when I least expect it
eng_Latn I've seen nothing of this new world.
eng_Latn richly as he merited such a fate by her hand.
eng_Latn had seen that he had not sought to aid her!
eng_Latn I do not mind if you ARE angry.
eng_Latn I do not want it said the old man
eng_Latn a heavyset young woman with a face made blotchy by rage.
eng_Latn or whether she was so full of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very twins
eng_Latn snuggled down beside him with her arms as far around his chest as they would reach.
eng_Latn holding me standing before him
eng_Latn for him to punish him for breach of discipline.
eng_Latn announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress
eng_Latn in him as a suitable social figure if only he did nothing to offend them?
eng_Latn how important it was for him to effect his purpose before we were heard
eng_Latn I'm afraid I'm not a very good host.
eng_Latn but I could not share his satisfaction.
eng_Latn unless this rule about not complaining extends to the squires of knights errant also.
eng_Latn went to have an explanation with his mother.
eng_Latn Never mind the hot dogs, Big BadWolf...
eng_Latn And while you are gone I will showPug some tricks of the trade.
eng_Latn I couldn't repeat them.
eng_Latn concluded that some unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.
eng_Latn money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected.
eng_Latn who was accompanied by a little sister threeyears of age.
eng_Latn I fell on my knees before the ikon
eng_Latn I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with her.
eng_Latn it's all down again
eng_Latn Oh thank goodness! It's working!
eng_Latn she understood that her fate was sealed.
eng_Latn he liked her singing as he liked everything she did.
eng_Latn I'll be there waiting for you after eight if you wish.
eng_Latn but she had the ardent woman's need to rule beneficently by making the joy of another soul.
eng_Latn his lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout
eng_Latn when the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection.
eng_Latn he crushed his impulse to turn away.
eng_Latn the animals crept silently away.
eng_Latn so that all the materials for building were at hand.
eng_Latn as though somebody had pasted the picture from the album over his eyes.
eng_Latn perhaps he never came here
eng_Latn I'm not sure we'll want you then.
eng_Latn computing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.
eng_Latn they're wavering enough already.
eng_Latn I wanted to run away when I was fourteen years old
eng_Latn he felt that he must go away somewhere, anywhere.
eng_Latn turned up with a get well card she had made herself
eng_Latn as the whale swimming out from them, turned
eng_Latn I heard a little gasp and I looked up.
eng_Latn I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.
eng_Latn his name and crime entered in the books himselfassigned to two assistants, who saw to it that
eng_Latn for, going back a little, she took a short run
eng_Latn it is not my nature.
eng_Latn when she was about to leave for home
eng_Latn as if he had been pickled.
eng_Latn he had a slip of the tongue and said 'in trade
eng_Latn I show my travelcard to the driver and he nods.
eng_Latn until they covered the whole world.
eng_Latn the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class
eng_Latn so they chewed it turn about
eng_Latn she and I were alone.
eng_Latn Computer, please play my panic playlist.
eng_Latn she had just come from another village
eng_Latn his only thought was to turn round and make his escape from the angry presence of his master.
eng_Latn stopping to unpack his bundle
eng_Latn but haggard and old before her time
eng_Latn but she meant to bring a frock up with her in the morning and hurry into her clothes at the shop.
eng_Latn as if he regretted his outburst
eng_Latn when I went near him he made off into the thickest part of the forest.
eng_Latn while from the inside exploded a rear admiral's hat
eng_Latn you know just as much about the matter as I do.
eng_Latn had closed the nursery door upon me.
eng_Latn Is THIS the kind of place you dlike to have a holiday?
eng_Latn covering his face with his hand.
eng_Latn no lords, fiddlers, judges, or dancing masters.
eng_Latn it is fitting and necessary that I should know,
eng_Latn set it on the porch.
eng_Latn still he will believe.
eng_Latn you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman.
eng_Latn it was her turn to think.
eng_Latn because he had been dining with other guests, and had just taken tea.
eng_Latn perhaps we might contrive to get through the window there, or into a garret, and out by its skylight.
eng_Latn his voice rose a little
eng_Latn without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme
eng_Latn in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is quite a dish among some epicures
eng_Latn casting fear aside and regardless of what might happen
eng_Latn First Dog!
eng_Latn force is a great weakness.
eng_Latn at one spot a magnificent waterfall spilling to join it from somewhere up above, right athwart the road.
eng_Latn I hope to heaven that he has gone
eng_Latn when they ought to have been asleep hours ago.
eng_Latn pleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer.
eng_Latn dressed in black and concealed in a long veil
eng_Latn I'm glad you feel that way.
eng_Latn where the provisions looked so splendid and clean
eng_Latn it only needed one glance at the prince to see that in that quarter there was nothing to fear.
eng_Latn they were stopped by no one.
eng_Latn you'd better stop spinning that yarn to me I'm not green.
eng_Latn so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit, so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations, that
eng_Latn I never knew before that it was illegal to get drunk in a sporting house.
eng_Latn after which I was no more troubled with such questions.
eng_Latn we shall not make an end of it this twelvemonth.
eng_Latn You ve been a very good dog on mytour Pug. By all means, help yourself.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Dog?
eng_Latn I take it he's got a thing for guns
eng_Latn but intending in a short time to publish a volume by itself, expressly upon that subject
eng_Latn showed a countenance of abject terror
eng_Latn it gives light only to the holder!
eng_Latn there was no power on earth that could raise him from his prostration.
eng_Latn dipped the pen in the standish again
eng_Latn a sudden block put on the whole deal by the authorities
eng_Latn around which tens of thousands fell
eng_Latn whereas there was one visit he was most anxious to make without delay.
eng_Latn This is a book of children s verses from many times and places and it is called...
eng_Latn I've caught the secret.
eng_Latn only fastening one of my legs with a chain, near my bed
eng_Latn then my courage sank.
eng_Latn she commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.
eng_Latn come, sick and sore! AMEN!
eng_Latn by four in the afternoon she was successful.
eng_Latn when the maid led him through the darkness of the drawing room to the terrace in the patio
eng_Latn I hate repeating myself.
eng_Latn I'm not a magician or a mage.
eng_Latn I motioned with my finger for her to join me.
eng_Latn approached the officer and asked permission to speak to the prisoner.
eng_Latn with his tongue poking out
eng_Latn my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing
eng_Latn his skull fractured in falling
eng_Latn I am no man's servant!
eng_Latn or because they think I should not tell you so, young as you are.
eng_Latn while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling
eng_Latn I come home on leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and see that they are living better than before.
eng_Latn I am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound.
eng_Latn whose dinner I was unable to attend ,
eng_Latn as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room
eng_Latn I feel sure that today will see you gone from here.
eng_Latn my desire to rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable.
eng_Latn there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes.
eng_Latn he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught
eng_Latn by separating the several parts
eng_Latn I'll stick to whisky if you don't mind.
eng_Latn whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us.
eng_Latn cracked it over his own head
eng_Latn peered up and down the street, then withdrew his head quickly.
eng_Latn she promised him another bottle of cologne
eng_Latn I felt myself slippingthere was nothing to hold on to.
eng_Latn I am in earnest at last
eng_Latn how long before someone asks him to rig up an electric chair?
eng_Latn hearing the well known shaking at the garden gate.
eng_Latn the stove pipe, in the shape of a palm tree, spread its gilt leaves over the white ceiling
eng_Latn fear you get praying over me.
eng_Latn carefully administered the appointed number of drops
eng_Latn What a fine idea Pug.
eng_Latn the equally unseasonable impulse to burst into scornful invective.
eng_Latn but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief.
eng_Latn had no thought of trouble to come after the funeral.
eng_Latn four had been provided
eng_Latn lest they should prevent the execution of his praiseworthy and valiant purpose.
eng_Latn whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and profitable
eng_Latn I saw a sail to the north north east
eng_Latn an angry feeling rose in her and stopped around her heart
eng_Latn asked the young girl
eng_Latn had his usual effect upon me.
eng_Latn so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.
eng_Latn Oh. Is that not good?
eng_Latn see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those alforjas
eng_Latn this was to be the home of her wifehood
eng_Latn but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it.
eng_Latn but to break out of the rock and make herself heard must have required a huge amount of energy and effort.
eng_Latn three fixed crystal walkie talkie sets with a range of not less than five miles
eng_Latn but she made him weep with exasperation.
eng_Latn I will add since there is an aesthetics in all things
eng_Latn I took with me six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them into my own country.
eng_Latn or mind me, it will be too late!
eng_Latn with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder.
eng_Latn Out of bounds Tina?
eng_Latn awake, and look at me!
eng_Latn nobody would fool around with a preacher anyway.
eng_Latn they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here.
eng_Latn for it was a primitive force that existed before good and ill.
eng_Latn it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground.
eng_Latn had never seen it so crowded after sunset.
eng_Latn Umm There is a word... a special wordfor when a lot of snow lets go of a mountain and decides to run to the bottom...
eng_Latn the ink had not dried up in the inkwell
eng_Latn it was a long way and he must keep up his strength for that.
eng_Latn but I was club champion back in '76 and again in '79, and still pretty good in '86.
eng_Latn Or else that sneaky gang of picnic pilferers hiding out in the...old abandoned lighthouse! Come on boys, it's another job for The Thrilling Three!
eng_Latn You have a loud horn.
eng_Latn her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended,
eng_Latn for you're the one that's entitled to it most.
eng_Latn I jolted upright, shocked out of the dream.
eng_Latn bearing on its wide top several lamps and a long row of candles in candlesticks.
eng_Latn than he ran out and threw the leader down,
eng_Latn then I became a thief
eng_Latn Oh oh. That s too much woah!
eng_Latn but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock.
eng_Latn he never saw anybody
eng_Latn the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned.
eng_Latn thou seest how I am hated by enchanters!
eng_Latn yet two had been base born and one had deserted her
eng_Latn so they took him too.
eng_Latn she came to hate him also, and most of all.
eng_Latn to set forth the valour of my own dear countrymen
eng_Latn Every race I race he cheats and makes sure that I lose.
eng_Latn who immediately entered into conversation with two or three of the industrious idlers
eng_Latn the diver has seen it.
eng_Latn inside and outside.
eng_Latn fell heavily on his knees before the bed.
eng_Latn that's how I want you to look.
eng_Latn the old coachman, with his broad back filling a short, silver braided jacket,
eng_Latn Oh Rescued her from what?
eng_Latn one side palsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.
eng_Latn And if the baddies are giants?
eng_Latn therefore I shall confess and await forgiveness.
eng_Latn only now he did it to hide the trembling in his knees.
eng_Latn this the place for such a demand
eng_Latn stopped quite near the approaching train.
eng_Latn Who s a pretty pirate!
eng_Latn I think I see him now
eng_Latn but they were so rooted in local superstition
eng_Latn Thank-you Granny Pug. That was veryeducational, and only a bit dangerous.
eng_Latn cast lots to see who must stay to mind the goats of all.
eng_Latn but few they who deserve the name of knights.
eng_Latn pulling her skirt up a little so she could do it
eng_Latn the rice fields have gone back to marsh lands.
eng_Latn coming from the wing?
eng_Latn rocked to and fro with sorrow.
eng_Latn went down to the breakfast parlour, where breakfast was prepared.
eng_Latn I have myheap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.
eng_Latn I offered to lie down that he might the more conveniently reach my ear.
eng_Latn but maybe there's a place for a preacher.
eng_Latn that he began his first caresses with so much care that his suggestion that she put on her nightdress seemed natural to her.
eng_Latn he concluded emphatically, and went out of the room.
eng_Latn laid her hand inside his shirt, against his chest.
eng_Latn that is no subject of regret at all.
eng_Latn waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep.
eng_Latn which was nothing but a large wooden tray on wheels
eng_Latn during the last eighteen hundred of which they had had but five days' rest.
eng_Latn without speaking to him, of course
eng_Latn Umm How curious.
eng_Latn you and you, you and nobody else.
eng_Latn Jingle Bells ... Jumble Sales .Aah.. Jungles!
eng_Latn they've been keeping him in the firehouse and not letting him bathe
eng_Latn therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him.
eng_Latn who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the young lady
eng_Latn for he never had felt better than this evening.
eng_Latn where I saw many labourers working with several sorts of tools in the ground
eng_Latn do you mean to say that when you could swim five hundred feet to shore afterwards
eng_Latn That s snow and ice Pug. We re in a world of frozen water.
eng_Latn was unconsciously acting as his enemy
eng_Latn I distinctly remember that in a single evening she lost an enormous sum.
eng_Latn but in his haste, he tripped.
eng_Latn walked out onto the field.
eng_Latn who was quite confounded at the metallic sound of these golden words.
eng_Latn why this would give him pleasure
eng_Latn then mixed bran and oats with a little water for its food.
eng_Latn said he had invented it, thinking it matched and tallied with the adventures he had read of in his histories.
eng_Latn Are you all right, boys?
eng_Latn but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful
eng_Latn feeling completely torn.
eng_Latn well, I wouldn't go as far as that.
eng_Latn Bow Wowzer! Those stairs made usrun around in circles...and we can run around in circles too!
eng_Latn I'll have you tried, and you'll be hanged!
eng_Latn but the swooning too was real this time.
eng_Latn I was able to establish the identity of the man and the woman
eng_Latn sat down on the trail.
eng_Latn she knew them both directly.
eng_Latn she rose easily to her feet and walked out of the cell unaided.
eng_Latn with his eyes almost shut
eng_Latn but I ought to warn you that I may be wasting your time and attention.
eng_Latn a great readiness to be pleased with other people.
eng_Latn but the woman's to whom he had bound himself.
eng_Latn he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there.
eng_Latn at that the hundreds who had crowded into the hot stuffycourtroom after dinner though many
eng_Latn uttering a whimpering yet clear cry and then falling forward in a faint.
eng_Latn then I dunno I just sort of came to my senses and ran for it.
eng_Latn the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent.
eng_Latn I couldn't see no more eyes though.
eng_Latn the three following not a drop will be got.
eng_Latn pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls.
eng_Latn ready to run away
eng_Latn what he don't know about makin' things grow would fill a book.
eng_Latn so he presently found himself leaning to the impression
eng_Latn than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir.
eng_Latn he bent over it again.
eng_Latn looked up in her face with great surprise.
eng_Latn but better so than die of shame
eng_Latn remained a little longer doubtful.
eng_Latn carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.
eng_Latn Oh ..If only I could persuade Cow to jump. But she s very nervous.
eng_Latn I wheeled it until I saw something I wanted to paint.
eng_Latn hy, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that horse now
eng_Latn I got into a quarrel with a foreman
eng_Latn it was the way you
eng_Latn or not as precise as I ought
eng_Latn he was filled with a sudden sense of trepidation.
eng_Latn But if you look over there...
eng_Latn I don t stand a chance in the bigspelling contest .
eng_Latn for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point
eng_Latn but the fee was twenty five bucks.
eng_Latn here was one of the best of possible shipmates.
eng_Latn not only because the match was good
eng_Latn OUR race!
eng_Latn thus the next day that the bano chanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed and cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper
eng_Latn but a swearing good man something like me only there's a good deal more of him.
eng_Latn rsula took care of her as if she were her own daughter.
eng_Latn occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling
eng_Latn but he got in some good swipes before we were out of his reach.
eng_Latn even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear.
eng_Latn Yoo hoo! I'm behind you!
eng_Latn I have to, you know
eng_Latn I don't bear malice about it.
eng_Latn then licked some up on his tongue.
eng_Latn for, on their way, they had effected a wholesale loan from an armorer's shop.
eng_Latn the husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
eng_Latn I want to drink, and especially to drink with you.
eng_Latn Granny Pug s Guide to Ancient Egypt
eng_Latn but, soon tiring of the studios, entirely by himself.
eng_Latn to be convinced by a single proof.
eng_Latn for as her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him
eng_Latn I must speak to you
eng_Latn then satisfying herself by her eyes that it was he
eng_Latn but the stamp of sorrow in the signers.
eng_Latn to what headsman each of them belonged.
eng_Latn for the moments stolen from arithmetic to write her letters
eng_Latn for, in spite of you and your ass
eng_Latn to ascertain if we could get leave to carry out this great idea.
eng_Latn that is because you are dilettantish and amateurish.
eng_Latn but between my jittery hands and the redlining heat sensor, the engine just shuddered under the hood without turning over.
eng_Latn if only he might venture to talk to her more
eng_Latn after offering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.
eng_Latn but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.
eng_Latn not come into my study?
eng_Latn And it didn t even wobble!
eng_Latn at least overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave.
eng_Latn though there are people who'd be pleased to describe me for you.
eng_Latn as an explanation of the first.
eng_Latn perhaps about four thousand
eng_Latn I have a bookshop to run.
eng_Latn the news of which reached him almost at the same time.
eng_Latn then I've found him and I want to go to bed with him.
eng_Latn I'll go in with you, and if they don't turn me out, I'll stay to the end.
eng_Latn it was simply a question of patience.
eng_Latn after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board room.
eng_Latn OOOH I never thought I d do this again!
eng_Latn open a door which, should the wind blow it to, would shut upon one for ever
eng_Latn when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers.
eng_Latn I do! (beat) I don t.
eng_Latn his arms about her made her shake with helpless hate and fury.
eng_Latn sat there in her plaids and farthingales with her lap full of apples
eng_Latn as if he had been standing at the altar with her.
eng_Latn at six thirty this morning.
eng_Latn let him fall into a dust heap on purpose!
eng_Latn A giant bird?
eng_Latn Aah Isn t it a bit chilly at The North Pole?
eng_Latn drew and opened a sailor's clasp knife
eng_Latn they had to lay him on the floor
eng_Latn a piece of pie branded like an engine part.
eng_Latn I only ask of you a favor which will cost you but little, and be of very great service to me.
eng_Latn was better than any fancied might be such as she was in the habit of opposing to the actual.
eng_Latn the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required.
eng_Latn Oh no. I'm a muddy mess again. Ican t let anyone see me like this!
eng_Latn but she had the strength not to succumb to delirium.
eng_Latn tossed the rifle onto the corpse, and walked home.
eng_Latn turn out the light when you come back to bed
eng_Latn I found him on the lawn of a househis house
eng_Latn rendered the flesh loose and rancid.
eng_Latn I was a squirt jus' like you, a fartin' aroun' like a dog wolf.
eng_Latn I KNEW you would ask about him!
eng_Latn It took AGES to make, but it helps me feel a bit more brave.
eng_Latn I do not say
eng_Latn I let my head roll back around toward the fresh air and closed my eyes.
eng_Latn Then we must reassure it we mean no harm.
eng_Latn I notice they haven't made you two prefects.
eng_Latn was spiritually a hungered like the rest of us.
eng_Latn If we can think of a perfect place Pug. Perhaps we have a book in the shop that can help us?
eng_Latn it might be he had arrived early and taken a room.
eng_Latn then we came to the object of my visit.
eng_Latn if you're here when I come tomorra, I'll run ya in.
eng_Latn you should be engaged without my knowing it
eng_Latn I was a fool to bring you together.
eng_Latn I come back and look around the quiet office
eng_Latn he smiled, but his tongue could not form a word as yet.
eng_Latn to ask him what he had said.
eng_Latn a something bordering on it in her style
eng_Latn that ain't any use.
eng_Latn a couple of sun perch
eng_Latn for whose movements no directions are given
eng_Latn How cu-ri-ous.
eng_Latn as might be easily tested by talking to him.
eng_Latn I say too,that there are rare gifts going to loss in the world
eng_Latn asked me, whether I was a whig or tory?
eng_Latn his face was bright scarlet.
eng_Latn I haven't a cent in my pockets, and nothing to do.
eng_Latn Now can we start our race?
eng_Latn but you may be sure I will not open my lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship's
eng_Latn his tomb had disappeared
eng_Latn I want to see how far she can extend.
eng_Latn yet that you should fall into a delusion so great
eng_Latn u, I decidedly refused him
eng_Latn you'll see nothing to provoke you.
eng_Latn I hope I have not hurt you!
eng_Latn I've seen him.
eng_Latn without her being conscious of the fact, entered upon its convalescence.
eng_Latn for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point
eng_Latn they did not have any information enabling them to replace it with the true one.
eng_Latn there are only a hundred roubles here, not two hundred and fifty.
eng_Latn I've always been glad I said that.
eng_Latn I don t think this is inside my ownmind Dog. They d be a lot more doggy biscuits if it was.
eng_Latn but he does not like talking himself and can't do it, as you will see.
eng_Latn trailed behind her like a cape.
eng_Latn absorbed in the irresistible attraction
eng_Latn just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes.
eng_Latn we picked up another three just as we were leaving.
eng_Latn has given you this quarter of an hour for repentance
eng_Latn but some have brought a charge against the author's memory
eng_Latn but the certain knowledge that in an hour, then in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now this very INSTANT
eng_Latn he had given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction.
eng_Latn like a shiver running down his spine.
eng_Latn another third were his intimate chums, and the remainder were friendly acquaintances.
eng_Latn when chancing to turn a corner, and looking back as I did so
eng_Latn You d have a very hairy face if you were!
eng_Latn put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip.
eng_Latn I have never till today told even him
eng_Latn I was looking for a job
eng_Latn she and I were alone.
eng_Latn the man said as he led her into the sittingroom where a large platinum blonde woman was gazing rapturously at the TV screen.
eng_Latn he was left lying down and alone
eng_Latn followed the count into the room
eng_Latn immediately repaired to the usual walk on the terrace to see if there were any sign of the reed
eng_Latn I hated that she had this unconscious power over me.
eng_Latn handing him the quarter and closing the door.
eng_Latn twiddled the speed dial, and put them back up to his eyes.
eng_Latn but he was so concerned with the outbreak of cholera in the colonial district
eng_Latn pursued the unfortunate baronet
eng_Latn you won't get anything else here. says the vagrant.
eng_Latn but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
eng_Latn fill in the time until we are due at the hotel.
eng_Latn yet the party gave the impression of a unit
eng_Latn we can die but once
eng_Latn more masterful than crafty
eng_Latn but instead had decided to walk.
eng_Latn but all the same
eng_Latn two chamois leather jackets of kingfisher blue
eng_Latn Wow-Bowzer. Time to go boys. I mvegan!
eng_Latn I fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university.
eng_Latn now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!
eng_Latn fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge.
eng_Latn he had come home.
eng_Latn then take and GIVE IT TO THE GIRLS.
eng_Latn left behind by the advance of civilisation
eng_Latn I'll take the order and send it, along with your brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.
eng_Latn made one think of too many eyes behind the curtains.
eng_Latn You can Dog, if you want to.
eng_Latn he encouraged, he leaped from the sill and ran to him.
eng_Latn I'll have to be going now, though,
eng_Latn I meant to get my say in first
eng_Latn but that was because his mother hadbeen notified that she was not needed.
eng_Latn another time he attacked a very great and powerful army
eng_Latn he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal.
eng_Latn I'm not ashamed of myself as company for anybody.
eng_Latn seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come.
eng_Latn taking me up again in her hand, walked into the garden, where she set me down.
eng_Latn I stare at her for a few silent seconds.
eng_Latn still holding her straw travelling hat by its ribbon in her hand.
eng_Latn suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet?
eng_Latn I returned to the window and fetched it thence.
eng_Latn for you to go on fighting with
eng_Latn she was travelling into the remoteness of pure pity and loyalty towards her husband.
eng_Latn but a moment!
eng_Latn because you haven't any friends here you can go to.
eng_Latn I shuddered, remembering that time from my own perspective.
eng_Latn sounded shrill and unnatural
eng_Latn without reflecting for an instant on the result, nor on the experiences which he had already gone through.
eng_Latn she is going to send me away.
eng_Latn I had never seen the squire so near at hand.
eng_Latn tripping down a couple of steps
eng_Latn should accept his opinions in full and have none of her own.
eng_Latn sat down, loaded his plate with pork and two big biscuits
eng_Latn asking your pardon.
eng_Latn let us look at society in the narrow sense.
eng_Latn people going a long journey when they are married.
eng_Latn he strokes my hair gently.
eng_Latn a wordless ongoing agreement.
eng_Latn then he conjured a raised platform into existence along the right wall.
eng_Latn I need never want for men who'll take me to the theatre.
eng_Latn a doublebarreled shotgun clutched in both hands.
eng_Latn in case there was a glass of water somewhere
eng_Latn he is extremely well trained.
eng_Latn but they kept on watching the room.
eng_Latn the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.
eng_Latn as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived
eng_Latn in him as a suitable social figure if only he did nothing to offend them?
eng_Latn cheer up, rouse yourself and show that gallant spirit that knights errant ought to have.
eng_Latn so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured
eng_Latn he struck at them right and left in his blindness
eng_Latn leading the way into her drawing room.
eng_Latn Dog loved the smell of books.
eng_Latn I was only aware of this exchange with the lesser part of my concentration.
eng_Latn I've loved you as if you were my own son.
eng_Latn which at once surprised and amused her companion.
eng_Latn only once she said in passing that in all human sorrows nothing gives comfort but love and faith,
eng_Latn Here we see the Catford Cats Choir.
eng_Latn I haven't missed class since I started high school.
eng_Latn patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too.
eng_Latn he is admirably adapted to revive one's spirits
eng_Latn then relaxed his hold on her and laid his head back against the chair
eng_Latn uncomfortable feeling that she had been betrayed into a half pagan ecstasy.
eng_Latn clutching at the stone wall
eng_Latn in blue wool if it was to be a boy and in pink wool in case it was a girl.
eng_Latn W-what s a Wumpus Dog?
eng_Latn he said he preferred the train.
eng_Latn Oooo, like what Granny?
eng_Latn to fall down with her and pray for mercy on all without distinction.
eng_Latn not a dayover seventy nine years old
eng_Latn he intended to stand on his own efforts.
eng_Latn I used to slip back and sit outside the door
eng_Latn in front of him there lay not death but annihilation.
eng_Latn I don't deserve either of you.
eng_Latn I heard a rustling there.
eng_Latn I don't know nothing much about it.
eng_Latn I've had enough of it
eng_Latn but he was by that time clearheaded, and had none.
eng_Latn did just that, divorced her.
eng_Latn I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure
eng_Latn which was to yield completely and submissively to the spirit of the age
eng_Latn slapped her left hand on its biceps in a fascinating
eng_Latn dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.
eng_Latn made men who were overage wear red armbands.
eng_Latn This is a story about a magicalland and it is called The Chronicles of Unicornia, Book One.
eng_Latn I haven't enough to pay for a passport!
eng_Latn with inexorable obduracy banish me from the presence of thy beauty.
eng_Latn Oh yes. I ve never been happier slapping on the paint.
eng_Latn put away his pocket handkerchief, and cheered up.
eng_Latn I whirled and scooped up the phone he'd left on the counter.
eng_Latn that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship
eng_Latn I want to get some information about this benighted town.
eng_Latn ...I love the smallest book in the world which is balanced on of my nose!
eng_Latn I felt how it had hurt him when I'd cringed away from his hand.
eng_Latn Gloomy? Oo Hoe! Look at these!
eng_Latn while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant.
eng_Latn And then there was the time I defeated a band of robbers- with a feather!
eng_Latn I kicked one leg free and wrapped it around his waist.
eng_Latn I'm not sure if he'll wish to see me.
eng_Latn in 1948 had founded his own mining company.
eng_Latn with the captain of the ship and some minor officials from the shore around him.
eng_Latn but remember
eng_Latn that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness.
eng_Latn I'm probably not the usual, I admitted.
eng_Latn I had a great power.
eng_Latn in the streets, of justling others, or being justled himself into the kennel.
eng_Latn fell to gazing longingly across the wide river
eng_Latn This one has pictures you can colour.
eng_Latn let her want to be kissed, first.
eng_Latn I must tell you the truth.
eng_Latn was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over
eng_Latn I wondered if she'd had a pleasant time on the outing.
eng_Latn That s our mean, selfish, vain and angry king.
eng_Latn set to work at the petition
eng_Latn but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to the husband
eng_Latn Hello.
eng_Latn I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to copy,
eng_Latn I climbed up to the main body while the early patrol searched the railway.
eng_Latn found my wife and family in good health.
eng_Latn he had never acknowledged its existence to himself.
eng_Latn And here we are in a forest.
eng_Latn sign it with blood.
eng_Latn I must have been the first person to put on that mackintosh since the handkerchief was used.
eng_Latn but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place
eng_Latn I shall lose my way.
eng_Latn while the full force of it came home to her.
eng_Latn he ordered a glass of the same for himself.
eng_Latn I have not asked myself the question.
eng_Latn explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next
eng_Latn Mmmm, sausages.
eng_Latn I had been long afraid of this resolution
eng_Latn with a powdered head and gold spectacles.
eng_Latn but must have examples that are palpable, easy,
eng_Latn until I had told the brothers she was sinking fast
eng_Latn he drank no more.
eng_Latn I'm not going to waste time trying to talk you out of it.
eng_Latn see if he won't.
eng_Latn if someone throws something at you
eng_Latn if they hadn't been so worried about what they had to do.
eng_Latn the gearshift is footoperated, the throttle hand operated, and that takes a lot of getting used to.
eng_Latn but you will find terrible charges
eng_Latn he has brought nothing but trouble here!
eng_Latn where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair.
eng_Latn what is said in heat, that thing unsays itself.
eng_Latn while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly.
eng_Latn but it had been a narrow escape
eng_Latn made him bury his face in that astonishing composition
eng_Latn understand how far to carry their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.
eng_Latn Mine!
eng_Latn I'd already catalogued this one.
eng_Latn the second was criticism.
eng_Latn so he tucked his arm companionably through hers
eng_Latn I scarcely know how we got through that day.
eng_Latn go several times through that operation of kissing the sticks of her fan, and then tapping his hand with it.
eng_Latn was still not a little pleased and impressed by the effect of it all.
eng_Latn with more than courage with a stern triumph.
eng_Latn she turned to the window to admire the view.
eng_Latn whom she had often received in the middle of the night at the back door.
eng_Latn I cringed internally at her imagined reaction.
eng_Latn so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book.
eng_Latn presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it
eng_Latn she saw that the morning had become more foggy there during the last hour.
eng_Latn said he thought that would suit him.
eng_Latn Can you read a map?
eng_Latn she had an attack of hysterics.
eng_Latn renouncing his claim
eng_Latn although there was not above a century or two between them.
eng_Latn to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification.
eng_Latn but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could do me any mischief.
eng_Latn this man had been four years longer than himself in prison
eng_Latn that for her had never existed
eng_Latn I seen forty two cars a you fellas go by yesterday.
eng_Latn changed his mind, and pretended to want a pen mended.
eng_Latn then suddenly sat up
eng_Latn I'll bring it you directly.
eng_Latn whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughts so high.
eng_Latn highly uncertain as to whether she would prove of service here or anywhere.
eng_Latn Oh no. We spent so long confusing the wolf the pizza has gone cold.
eng_Latn was unable to understand his brother's passion.
eng_Latn since my only protector is removed
eng_Latn he hasn't once looked out.
eng_Latn that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself.
eng_Latn hence he started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.
eng_Latn for myself, I am convinced without it.
eng_Latn at last brought off the chamberlain.
eng_Latn he has spent a large fortune in litigation.
eng_Latn I may tell you he did not know and does not know half the mass
eng_Latn he felt a sudden pang at his heart
eng_Latn he repented that he had brought her.
eng_Latn behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery
eng_Latn so be perwented, or anything for an excuse
eng_Latn at last he said that he had indeed seen the unhappy maiden
eng_Latn but immediately abandoned that thought.
eng_Latn Climb on my shoulders, Pug. I ll do the balancing for us both. Uh Oh Umm Er
eng_Latn lug him thrice by both ears
eng_Latn felt that they were very attentive.
eng_Latn but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week.
eng_Latn come home with me do, and we'll see the day in!
eng_Latn he had foolishly drunk all of his water
eng_Latn in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house
eng_Latn a poultice to lose time
eng_Latn said the magistrate, without any introduction
eng_Latn then her bones were starting through the skin.
eng_Latn her soul lives in the body of this demon.
eng_Latn with whom I received four hundred pounds for a portion.
eng_Latn which was out ofuse, in the most remote corner of the shed.
eng_Latn he asked him to stay to dinner.
eng_Latn one of whose partners acted as company secretary and was also on the board.
eng_Latn I am a clown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book – now it's over.
eng_Latn reined his horse in.
eng_Latn don't let us be in a hurry to condemn him.
eng_Latn gave it as their opinion that he had been asleep for a week.
eng_Latn since there is ever a sort of fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations.
eng_Latn must never be withdrawn as long as he lived.
eng_Latn but her habitual control of manner helped her.
eng_Latn I wanted to show him in all his glory.
eng_Latn but I am awfully fond of children, too.
eng_Latn I longed to see the ocean
eng_Latn made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture
eng_Latn however weak it may seem.
eng_Latn I need me a grubstake.
eng_Latn attired in black, with thick black veils and large black silk poke bonnets.
eng_Latn I love her more than anything in the world!
eng_Latn I miss it being dark Dog.
eng_Latn they were not harsh nor cruel.
eng_Latn but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months.
eng_Latn yet she did not abandon what she had planned to do.
eng_Latn but felt the more convinced that it was necessary.
eng_Latn he says it don't do no good to read books
eng_Latn I am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me.
eng_Latn And we can give you a few tips on how to make your kite even better.
eng_Latn give the public some really helpful and constructive news instead of all these murders and divorces.
eng_Latn her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected
eng_Latn I have been up to the eyes in this business.
eng_Latn but ears, and no limbs but arms, in these critical moments.
eng_Latn I felt it kinda jar when I yelled.
eng_Latn we shall not make an end of it this twelvemonth.
eng_Latn had practised ina small town ever since.
eng_Latn but never touched at it
eng_Latn he would have sacrificed the victory of his cause to his pride of principle.
eng_Latn is such that oftentimes a man may be accusedof something that he did not do
eng_Latn he was standing
eng_Latn I know I don't have to.
eng_Latn I was way behind because I started to read & write so late.
eng_Latn Thank you Dogstar One. Welcome to my laboratory in space.
eng_Latn she was saying.
eng_Latn he reclined beside her.
eng_Latn banners, cannon, and two enemy generals.
eng_Latn Hello. My name is Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn I may want to send you to a psychiatrist.
eng_Latn my half effaced thought instantly revived.
eng_Latn I went a good deal into that, at one time.
eng_Latn she endowed with her fortune.
eng_Latn the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed.
eng_Latn of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us.
eng_Latn the others were only reflections of that living fire of goodness and love.
eng_Latn I remember I went once into his room when there was no one else there.
eng_Latn she was also very tired.
eng_Latn I think I know where they are Pug.
eng_Latn he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears.
eng_Latn which turned into a choking cough.
eng_Latn I wish for no virtues of that kind.
eng_Latn either fall down some hidden staircase
eng_Latn I could see the sides of it encompassed with several gradations of galleries, and stairs, at certain intervals, to descend from one to the other.
eng_Latn what a guilty little boy their president was half an hour ago.
eng_Latn that they should bear them company as far as his village, he paying them so much a day.
eng_Latn I loved it.
eng_Latn Right. Sit still while I paint yourportrait. And no fidgeting.
eng_Latn I will come to that later.
eng_Latn almost before he had righted himself in his saddle
eng_Latn if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give it me
eng_Latn do you know what you did, unfortunate adviser?
eng_Latn the way people are rebuilding
eng_Latn there locked him up.
eng_Latn for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.
eng_Latn I'd call that a pretty strong recommendation.
eng_Latn nay, that he was even looking at the side table for cold meat which was not there.
eng_Latn I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.
eng_Latn she was very stealthily, drew out her pocket handkerchief and applied it to her eyes
eng_Latn but if the advice was that the palace security troops needed extensive further training and a crash course, at that
eng_Latn I'm alive, that is not my fault
eng_Latn but instead had decided to walk.
eng_Latn that certainty was a terror.
eng_Latn staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm.
eng_Latn Now where did we put our...
eng_Latn because unexpected and from the person whose commendation she most valued.
eng_Latn but this is not at all being like a queen.
eng_Latn he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach
eng_Latn he had been obliged to give in.
eng_Latn but is very generous to one quite impertinent girl
eng_Latn he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home.
eng_Latn she had an attack of hysterics.
eng_Latn but suddenly his glance was transferred
eng_Latn but mutton half making up his mind to come into the church.
eng_Latn come and sit aside of me
eng_Latn as I rode on, the gloom cleared.
eng_Latn And remember - a great magician never says how it's done. The end.
eng_Latn she left her vulgar teasing
eng_Latn that, to describe her worthily and tell thee the truth, she is very like thee.
eng_Latn Once Upon A Time there was a darkforest which was called The Dark Forest because
eng_Latn a big cross beside it, to show that the appointment was kept.
eng_Latn now she will understand better since you have told her you love her.
eng_Latn I'd made up my mine 'bout what I's agwyne to do.
eng_Latn MY granny - Granny Pug!
eng_Latn though he was not commander of either ship.
eng_Latn had erased all girlish traces from her.
eng_Latn he hit the field on all fours ' coughed
eng_Latn there I found myself under the influence of the ever watchful blue eye.
eng_Latn but once again, nothing came out of his mouth but a very large bubble.
eng_Latn I have no ground for the nonsensical vanity of fancying everybody who comes near me is in love with me.
eng_Latn that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.
eng_Latn I look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look at.
eng_Latn it was then that she lost her calm and lived only for him
eng_Latn when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud.
eng_Latn to hand a glass of water without looking
eng_Latn turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records.
eng_Latn I don't have that much imagination.
eng_Latn everything seemed asleep
eng_Latn he had neither listened nor heard.
eng_Latn I dwelt there once, and still I return when I may.
eng_Latn I'd like to take a sock at you.
eng_Latn I think you did really well
eng_Latn I then took off my coat, and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.
eng_Latn this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right.
eng_Latn he had not the courage to again visit the death chamber.
eng_Latn That journey would take a lot oftime Pug and I didn t bring enough doggy biscuits.
eng_Latn he said he knew how better than me and he did, too, because he's used to camping.
eng_Latn I am quite content.
eng_Latn I put on my smile again.
eng_Latn And so we bid farewell to theguardians of ancient Egypt - and to Granny Pug.
eng_Latn I can't see him anywhere.
eng_Latn that was only till two o'clock.
eng_Latn till she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely.
eng_Latn here another self came in.
eng_Latn I have even informed him of a circumstance
eng_Latn if it is not shot with a sling as they were in the battle of the two armies
eng_Latn I sought it and found it.
eng_Latn but merely bowed.
eng_Latn Duck!
eng_Latn so he didn't bother about driving us through
eng_Latn shouted the count, dying with laughter.
eng_Latn asked me, whether I was a whig or tory?
eng_Latn grieving the more since he had put forward his own opinion with little confidence
eng_Latn I take it you did not conceal the fact from him.
eng_Latn the first words I learnt, were to express my desire
eng_Latn because it's so fast and difficult to see.
eng_Latn A CHEESE cake?
eng_Latn so happy was she to be in the world again.
eng_Latn that he was condescending when he noticed them at all.
eng_Latn bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head
eng_Latn he nearly knocked him into a barrel of dragon dung outside an apothecary.
eng_Latn for, upon my admittance two days after my arrival
eng_Latn the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle.
eng_Latn I'll help you till you can get some work.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer! I know a something Ican do!
eng_Latn went and took down his hat and cloak, which were hanging by the door.
eng_Latn I was sitting on it all the time!
eng_Latn I've heard about that too, it's dangerous.
eng_Latn it is not an easy thing even to thread a path for principles in the intricacies of the world
eng_Latn it was indeed twenty three minutes to six
eng_Latn I says, that's what you get for narking ME!
eng_Latn much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed.
eng_Latn glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle
eng_Latn I tested the elastic band, struggling to force it to remain solid as I stretched it away from me.
eng_Latn even decent boys need reminding sometimes.
eng_Latn I have to get back to the studio.
eng_Latn I felt a chill down my backbone and my knees shook.
eng_Latn rather, you need not think of her at all.
eng_Latn What!?
eng_Latn when the garden bell rang.
eng_Latn where it had hit the hearth
eng_Latn but to be sure it did not do him justice.
eng_Latn GIVE THAT TO ME!
eng_Latn I have got to equip my men with new clothes and boots.
eng_Latn had a society of their own of which they now elected her a member.
eng_Latn making me a sign to step into it
eng_Latn capable, as heretofore, of continual improvement by anything he said.
eng_Latn said the other, not sounding sorry at all.
eng_Latn I turn around, bewildered
eng_Latn but he still had to duck
eng_Latn but all through the house
eng_Latn how can I speak a language
eng_Latn no two parts of which were of one precise shade
eng_Latn which I then thought most unreasonable.
eng_Latn throwing back her wraps, and showing a thin but well built figure.
eng_Latn in any case, they had little time for speculating on such things now.
eng_Latn The pawprints led into a jungle with a wall of prickly thorns.
eng_Latn perhaps it is only to be overcome by a sense of fellowship deep enough to make all efforts at isolation seem mean and petty instead of exalting.
eng_Latn the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.
eng_Latn I just didn't want to spend my honeymoon writhing in pain.
eng_Latn the prisoner was brought in
eng_Latn arrange with his servants not to take him back that day
eng_Latn I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again. Mine ear is much enamour d of thy note.
eng_Latn we are not in the habit of bestowing much thought on them.
eng_Latn were too much interested in themselves to pay much attention to him now.
eng_Latn I am so glad to be here.
eng_Latn how rich you were
eng_Latn I was so busy telling people factsDog, I never learnt to fly!
eng_Latn but the old man resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened
eng_Latn I don't know what's the matter with you.
eng_Latn he let it walk off down the beach and then sang .
eng_Latn was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so.
eng_Latn but who never made up his mind to make the situation public
eng_Latn the travelling is at an end, and you have nothing to do
eng_Latn but I've never seen it done that way before.
eng_Latn Heh. I ll never get a piece of that pizza...
eng_Latn nor did he rise soon next morning.
eng_Latn I could keep her steady for the goal.
eng_Latn except skinnin' this here bull bitch along
eng_Latn the man who had always been within reach and whom she could never acknowledge.
eng_Latn I did hear once of a case over there, though, where a girl went to a doctor
eng_Latn then sank back in a swoon.
eng_Latn I told them everything just as it was.
eng_Latn Hmm ‘The Creepy Cottage’... ‘The Haunted House’... ‘The Scary Castle!’
eng_Latn must have died within minutes of retiring
eng_Latn was an elaborately wrought marble tomb
eng_Latn for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand.
eng_Latn while she was playing the clavichord.
eng_Latn I sat down quite disembarrassed.
eng_Latn it is not only projected but arranged
eng_Latn if his wife had implored the king, the queen,
eng_Latn that the raftsmen were all down at the village
eng_Latn for sure I dare say
eng_Latn not one would help us to defend the inn.
eng_Latn is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it.
eng_Latn ill at ease with him, and could not look him straight in the face.
eng_Latn don't oblige me to compel you.
eng_Latn I looked at him quickly.
eng_Latn symbols of the kind of life I love.
eng_Latn clasped it firmly in his hand
eng_Latn it is no matter I need not recall when.
eng_Latn the vast field of mythical constructions became intelligible
eng_Latn I suddenly rose and revealed myself.
eng_Latn you see, it would be your own business.
eng_Latn I will bear anything to morrow only not to night!
eng_Latn took off through the window into the night.
eng_Latn went about three miles into the country
eng_Latn that radicalism was threatening to swallow up all conservative elements,
eng_Latn creating a happy soul within that woodenness from the wealth of her own love.
eng_Latn Now you know how to draw Pug.
eng_Latn I know it's bold to ask, to disturb you when you wish for peace
eng_Latn couldn't think of anything to say, and closed it again.
eng_Latn then going around him he looked at him from head to foot.
eng_Latn but once we hit the treasure
eng_Latn now the tiresome chirping of a cricket, began.
eng_Latn I had left this woman in bitterness and hate
eng_Latn out of danger of possible stragglers.
eng_Latn offers no impediment, this very day she shall become my wife.
eng_Latn it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.
eng_Latn I read it with pleasure two months ago in the _Periodical Review_.
eng_Latn she felt that clearly.
eng_Latn while she stood by looking very contrite.
eng_Latn we're all wearing ours
eng_Latn I told him what I wanted and put the book into his hands
eng_Latn one in particular who is always persecuting him
eng_Latn new ways to help us make a richer life for ourselves
eng_Latn for it is growing late, and we have a great deal to do and to say and show.
eng_Latn I went out for a drive, and it was so fine I longed to be in the country.
eng_Latn waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen
eng_Latn but you are to remember that proof of motive is by nomeans indispensable or essential to conviction.
eng_Latn I paced quietly in front of the house.
eng_Latn You re capturing the inner me.
eng_Latn with a chimney sweep driving the hearse advised by the regular driver
eng_Latn who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion.
eng_Latn I set up my sail
eng_Latn No, this.
eng_Latn I'm so fond of her too, bless her.
eng_Latn I shall be so happy when she is his wife.
eng_Latn I thought it a very strong proof
eng_Latn apologised for not having dinner ready, and suggested that madame, in the meantime, should look over her house.
eng_Latn but to submit quietly and return home
eng_Latn asked the young girl
eng_Latn with a familiarity that cut him to the quick because his boldness came too late.
eng_Latn during which the queen pressed her hand to her side, evidently to still the beatings of her heart.
eng_Latn I'd thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me, even in joke!
eng_Latn And the record for being the first pug to squat on top of The North Pole balancing a dozen dog biscuits AND a walrus goes to... Pug!
eng_Latn I was impressed by all this at the time
eng_Latn I lit a cigarette to give myself a moment's time.
eng_Latn Yes Pug. Dear Diary, Today Pug and I read a book all about beaches.
eng_Latn touching her sister's chin, and looking at her with indulgent affection.
eng_Latn I walked enchanted, and nothing held me back.
eng_Latn a fact which only became known after his death.
eng_Latn a half years than the sugar has.
eng_Latn smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before
eng_Latn whom one has the power of life and death
eng_Latn I'm as by golly liberal as you are religious, anyway!
eng_Latn for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.
eng_Latn so fine that the slender gold thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat.
eng_Latn perhaps even in her mind, which others might try to poison.
eng_Latn then hitched up the trousers of his bottle green suit
eng_Latn everybody knows pretty well that you can't pay them.
eng_Latn which had been provided and sent thither by the king's orders, upon the first intelligence he received of me.
eng_Latn they long to see the world
eng_Latn for he was shy to the pitch of imbecility
eng_Latn Awesome Dog, but not as awesome as the first sound cartoon which was made nearly a hundred years ago and starred a mouse!
eng_Latn I decided that I must escape at once, if ever.
eng_Latn I don't even dispute it.
eng_Latn but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand
eng_Latn that is, about fifty five years of age,
eng_Latn for wages were really much higher
eng_Latn once out at sea, let him come.
eng_Latn The biggest. The smallest. Theoddest. The first. Who knows, perhaps one day you ll create an amazing new fact too!
eng_Latn bearing a tray of tea and crumpets.
eng_Latn for here he was encroaching upon something t
eng_Latn while a third man rode me astride.
eng_Latn I doubted I could come up with the appropriate analogy to explain this one.
eng_Latn he thought himself of having recourse to his usual remedy
eng_Latn finally he could stand it no more, and tried to revolt against it.
eng_Latn to whom he was beholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm.
eng_Latn the shoulder is just bandaged.
eng_Latn he did not like mixing with the crowd.
eng_Latn if you would attend.
eng_Latn as though he had suddenly reached a decision
eng_Latn I expect they took us for lovers too.
eng_Latn it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time.
eng_Latn to repair his farm implements
eng_Latn he was made to take an oath and did so
eng_Latn then he sank to the earth.
eng_Latn I wouldn' lay de weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars, I wouldn't.
eng_Latn slipped his wand back inside his robes, and looked around, listening again.
eng_Latn to cheer the hands at the windlass
eng_Latn It could be the Emerald Emperor!
eng_Latn I need not tell you what is to be done.
eng_Latn I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin and feel the ground.
eng_Latn by him I was recommended to several patients.
eng_Latn he'll tell you where to go, an' what time, an' then he'll go on.
eng_Latn Trying to solve the most baffling mystery of my career. But I seem to have lost my assistant.
eng_Latn which was the custom despite the laws prohibiting it.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Pug.
eng_Latn I can't stand waiting anymore.
eng_Latn resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.
eng_Latn between them and the white haired man afar off, was the one small link
eng_Latn flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor.
eng_Latn especially as there is no real squire's house to dispute the point
eng_Latn childish late afternoons, and he won her confidence
eng_Latn you don't smell good.
eng_Latn how and why, having oncesecured her love he felt and thought himself content
eng_Latn I'll never forget this.
eng_Latn I hear a thumping sound from her room
eng_Latn And sweep up our glitter.
eng_Latn soundlessly let go her breath.
eng_Latn I told him why before I lit into him.
eng_Latn We ll find you Granny Pug.
eng_Latn I even have a song about it.
eng_Latn every face that had given him such torments and such raptures
eng_Latn he gave me a lift homeward.
eng_Latn at last the owner men came to the point.
eng_Latn was exhilarating enough to lead him over the same ground again the first thing in the morning.
eng_Latn I should like you to think sometimes of me.
eng_Latn Now that s what I call blank.
eng_Latn which was all out of proportion to the fragile, gimcrack scene.
eng_Latn there was another loud BANG
eng_Latn interestingly barren and without importance.
eng_Latn each person you meet wants the same.
eng_Latn desire most to punish with my own hands
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer. I ve had an idea!
eng_Latn hearing him groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.
eng_Latn I chuckled hopefully it was too quiet for her to hear.
eng_Latn because it has awakened and has begun to beat again
eng_Latn I determined to go up and see for myself.
eng_Latn they heard voices at the front of the cabin.
eng_Latn that is the plain truth.
eng_Latn after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed
eng_Latn they came forward to raise the father and daughter from the ground.
eng_Latn now it had not long cleared up.
eng_Latn parents are not to settle children in life against their will.
eng_Latn she was only afraid of the expression of his displeasure.
eng_Latn I'm sure I shall.
eng_Latn we ought to understand that and not play at war.
eng_Latn that he had not willingly left her to die in the water.
eng_Latn I shall have to teach her first how to study
eng_Latn but now it held the shape of footprints.
eng_Latn that you might put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and
eng_Latn when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture
eng_Latn for any beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light to my reason and strength to my heart
eng_Latn I just need to ' take this call.
eng_Latn isn't that suffering!
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad
eng_Latn Indeed, the Cheshire Cat was a very mischievous creature, but behind that strange, sly smile was a sweet and gentle nature, and the best palace puss-kins of them all.
eng_Latn he had come home.
eng_Latn I smell a mystery Dog.
eng_Latn that was something else that happened when we got back to the hotel.
eng_Latn who was as much interested as he wasimpressed and who listened to her with respect and sympathy.
eng_Latn I provided the best substitute I could by dreaming of dragons until morning.
eng_Latn his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions graceful, and his deportment majestic.
eng_Latn at three in the afternoon he was still waiting for it to clear.
eng_Latn sputtered the pen across the paper painfully
eng_Latn I could enter perfectly well by the back door
eng_Latn leave me nothing but my heart.
eng_Latn I was more interested than distressed.
eng_Latn but that he wished, seriously, to marry at last
eng_Latn I can't talk to you here.
eng_Latn following hard upon the footsteps of our friend.
eng_Latn but the lady and mistress of an empire of dust and cobwebs
eng_Latn I have discovered a bit of a candle here, and we must take the risk of a small light to make a course by the boat compass.
eng_Latn he was well aware of his effect on the general
eng_Latn WOWBOWZAH!
eng_Latn as the first proof of amity
eng_Latn I am certain that, as soon as ever I 'begin to play for myself' and I still have 120 gulden left , I shall win.
eng_Latn still enlarged upon his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it.
eng_Latn And although it was a tree and couldn t move much, it could change. And watch people come and go and change around it.
eng_Latn that he come to learn the collar business.
eng_Latn I told her to go back to bed.
eng_Latn so saying he took out from his breasta metal crucifix
eng_Latn I didn't realize my mistake until I held it to my ear.
eng_Latn sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded by her daughters
eng_Latn I shook my head and edged toward the hallway.
eng_Latn I stand by you through thick and thin.
eng_Latn I can't help what's past.
eng_Latn I could teach you in a few minutes if you wanted me to.
eng_Latn many of which died at sea
eng_Latn I'm not going to mention any names.
eng_Latn There are lots of ways to entertain people Willow. And when you ve found one why not do it even more?
eng_Latn his head bent low into the thick mass of her golden hair.
eng_Latn she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life
eng_Latn I am sure I shall not be able to sleep.
eng_Latn knowing her fate and powerless to avoid it.
eng_Latn that they had much to say to one another in private
eng_Latn I got up before dawn and went after them.
eng_Latn but it had also brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women.
eng_Latn made no sense whatsoever.
eng_Latn so the very best advice I can give you now is that you do nothing at all now or at any time.
eng_Latn he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire
eng_Latn carry a message from me, that her young lady will follow in time to attend the squire's funeral.
eng_Latn one old gentleman asked me wherethe mission was and when we held services.
eng_Latn with as little appearance as possible of doing so.
eng_Latn was still so pleased to think that even in connection with so ticklish a thing as this, he should be made the recipient of his confidence
eng_Latn but there was a malignant gleam in the old man's eye.
eng_Latn something had happened to the ignition.
eng_Latn don't blurt it out as you did to me.
eng_Latn because I loved you best.
eng_Latn than to lead one to love thee who abhors thee now.
eng_Latn so much so that it seems to have been written especially for you.
eng_Latn several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn.
eng_Latn I see I was up a stump and up it good.
eng_Latn stark naked, with an organdy ribbon in her hair.
eng_Latn he spied it at a distance
eng_Latn lives in a hut on the school grounds
eng_Latn You are now my new experimental chef!
eng_Latn having first humbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony.
eng_Latn I hadn't a shawl to cover me.
eng_Latn but stood at the toilet table near the window
eng_Latn I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp.
eng_Latn he was in a court surrounded by high walls
eng_Latn will open all my heart'or nearly so.
eng_Latn she shuddered with loathing.
eng_Latn a pond with beautiful birds in it
eng_Latn though the materials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds,
eng_Latn then force myself to turn around
eng_Latn let him entertain poor gentlemen with the sumptuous fare of his table
eng_Latn still no answer.
eng_Latn I could repel the attack made on me by enemies unknown to me
eng_Latn I'm half asleep already.
eng_Latn it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside
eng_Latn I remember that once
eng_Latn promised, if ever I had the good fortune to return to my native country
eng_Latn I took care that none should hear of it or of her under that name.
eng_Latn but at this moment she felt ready to take on anybody.
eng_Latn for which reason, instead of being followed and persecuted,
eng_Latn for though they brought him fame
eng_Latn still wearing the insignia of his rank, and shut the door.
eng_Latn he tried to imagine its effect on the head of his young friend.
eng_Latn from whose discretion and courtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.
eng_Latn if you choose, you may say good bye
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book! And it showed me lots about putting on a show - not being a show off.
eng_Latn that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten or bitten him to death
eng_Latn till he found a low place
eng_Latn I smelled fresh blood and saw that the cup was in her hands again.
eng_Latn when he put up his hand to push his glasses back on
eng_Latn We don t really go in for that sort of thing.
eng_Latn but there was still an uneasy feeling in his eyes as he looked at her.
eng_Latn remembered the child.
eng_Latn I'm going to look at the oak.
eng_Latn Them! Every day they try and cross this bridge! ... Look at the state of it!
eng_Latn I might reasonably expect, in about two hundred years, to be the wealthiest man in the kingdom.
eng_Latn his brow became smooth again.
eng_Latn I speedily found it would be impracticable to retain my charge beside me, as heretofore.
eng_Latn I will go and tell my mistress.
eng_Latn for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain.
eng_Latn for however man's free will may be restricted
eng_Latn when the sailors began chanting
eng_Latn I love telling that story.
eng_Latn Ho ho ho. That should do the trick Hupp
eng_Latn if this were death
eng_Latn begged her to proceed.
eng_Latn I'd like at least a couple of weeks longer.
eng_Latn was at once upon its feet, craning and stirring.
eng_Latn answering the first part of her tirade.
eng_Latn sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction.
eng_Latn I was firmly convinced that he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured it, contemplating it as a possibility.
eng_Latn I grab my jacket and almost run out of the office
eng_Latn while indistinguishable figures descended from a wagon.
eng_Latn but it's incredible yeh don't know his name
eng_Latn in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him.
eng_Latn but still his affairs did not improve.
eng_Latn so long as the children were not disgraced, and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position.
eng_Latn I am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients!
eng_Latn he ran and fetched a colleague.
eng_Latn whereas these gipsies were an ignorant people, not much better than savages.
eng_Latn but his next movement was to crush himself boots in hand,and hat on under the bed
eng_Latn he decided to deny themotion.
eng_Latn but decided not to.
eng_Latn If there are, I'm sure they will bequite friendly.
eng_Latn Are you feeling better Dog?
eng_Latn I went into the wigwam
eng_Latn took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.
eng_Latn I just met one, and saw him off.
eng_Latn so she rocked
eng_Latn I'll come tomorrow.
eng_Latn but with an appeal to her understanding, and sometimes with instructive correction.
eng_Latn I congratulate you.
eng_Latn so long as I get out of this.
eng_Latn I see I warn't lucky.
eng_Latn I rose as soon as day dawned.
eng_Latn he was listening all the time for a ring at the bell.
eng_Latn while the father talks to you
eng_Latn to be cuffed and buffeted through the world
eng_Latn I don't aim to starve to death before I kill the man that's starving me.
eng_Latn I only noticed it later.
eng_Latn if you've nothing to eat,
eng_Latn I led my young lady out
eng_Latn had very little to do with reality.
eng_Latn then I heard the key turn once more
eng_Latn AND NOT WHAT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TODO!!! TEST NUMBER TWO!
eng_Latn he intended to stand on his own efforts.
eng_Latn I forgot to tell you
eng_Latn if you repent there is still time.
eng_Latn he had been almost dozing off, lost in the heat and his thoughts.
eng_Latn then he would walk down the highway
eng_Latn It's an evil knight and he wantsKing Arthur s crown!
eng_Latn I've been doing it all day here.
eng_Latn but no one is above gratitude.
eng_Latn do not move!
eng_Latn I'm so glad I found you in.
eng_Latn that the monster had convinced him of this love.
eng_Latn your sister thinks so as well as I.
eng_Latn as if he were still ship's doctor
eng_Latn but I have not therefore ceased to be what I was before
eng_Latn How will Father get back safely!?
eng_Latn he would not be able to get back before evening.
eng_Latn but I did not sufficiently repent.
eng_Latn except the bachelor, who thought fit to accompany them half a league out of the village
eng_Latn its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
eng_Latn I wish to know if, in demanding my signature
eng_Latn that he was so to regard it.
eng_Latn the unknown things that lay beneath.
eng_Latn I won't answer for you if you move.
eng_Latn then turned to the left up a cross street.
eng_Latn but thicker than a half crown.
eng_Latn in which suddenly something gives way beneath you
eng_Latn the cossacks went their ways
eng_Latn she dared to recall for the first time the illusory days of that unreal love.
eng_Latn With all the children tucked up inbed, Bedtime Baboon rests her sleepy head.
eng_Latn sent it full in the goatherd's face
eng_Latn but it is rather a good thing that he has arrived just at this moment.
eng_Latn I'll do that for you.
eng_Latn which had never left her bed all these days
eng_Latn while there was yet time to rescind it.
eng_Latn but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run.
eng_Latn I am in earnest at last
eng_Latn whose hushed tones he was not to forget for the rest of his life.
eng_Latn I'll go in with you, and if they don't turn me out, I'll stay to the end.
eng_Latn gave an account of my behaviour to the six criminals above mentioned.
eng_Latn the composure of an older woman
eng_Latn pointed to nine on its golden face
eng_Latn although he must be miserable without them.
eng_Latn I stood upon a height about two hundred yards from the shore
eng_Latn Ook-Ook! Eek- Eek!
eng_Latn he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim,
eng_Latn take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation.
eng_Latn because it's not fair for me to want you here.
eng_Latn that ain't any use.
eng_Latn I'll meet you for breakfast in the dining room.
eng_Latn seized a candelabra and dashed it to the ground.
eng_Latn overflowed the city to that point.
eng_Latn only you are a man and I a woman
eng_Latn very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and what she is.
eng_Latn but they did not get much satisfaction out of him.
eng_Latn however, I made a shift to creep on all fours, and shelter myself, by lying flat on my face, on the lee side of a border of lemon thyme
eng_Latn she did not feel that way here.
eng_Latn but it was all confusion.
eng_Latn Then I will fetch some for you.
eng_Latn I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest possible manner to me
eng_Latn but not once of the impending danger.
eng_Latn now I cain't get her a movin' a tall.
eng_Latn I-I-think there might be somethingbehind us.
eng_Latn engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke
eng_Latn so brief that only he would have noticed
eng_Latn to restore new vigour to a crazy administration
eng_Latn then the teacher charged in, and made us drop everything and cut.
eng_Latn I was hard pressed to get enough venom into her heart to save her.
eng_Latn I hope now that this question is at an end, once and for all.
eng_Latn we must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier.
eng_Latn pulled out a particularly knobbly rolled up pair of socks.
eng_Latn to enjoy his prostration.
eng_Latn I thought I'd grieved you.
eng_Latn once more, though, she felt an electric response to his person
eng_Latn then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.
eng_Latn turned to walk to the house.
eng_Latn I want to stand on my own feet for what I'm worth.
eng_Latn in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you.
eng_Latn then the keeper touched him on the arm, and he turned and went back to breaking stone.
eng_Latn the bow and the general effrontery were of my own invention.
eng_Latn I scanned her brow for any passing line that might indicate a settling emotion.
eng_Latn that she was going to be able todecide for herself whether she wanted me to marry her or not.
eng_Latn when they'd be better spending their time hunting
eng_Latn by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter
eng_Latn It's just like him.
eng_Latn he lay on his back, staring up into the white fog
eng_Latn something more than they did!
eng_Latn no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair
eng_Latn I hadn't had any difficulty in fixing things with the firm.
eng_Latn but I wished to apprise you beforehand of what may possibly occur.
eng_Latn calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs
eng_Latn but he asked me to send for him when you came for the baby.
eng_Latn I don t think swimming goggles willwork, Pug. Try this instead.
eng_Latn he looked up with an angry scowl.
eng_Latn as I resumed it the pair came in.
eng_Latn here was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap.
eng_Latn I'll stand her friend and counsellor to the last.
eng_Latn then, with a cry of anguish, she tottered forward, stretching out her arms to him.
eng_Latn from the earliest days of the revolt he had careully worked
eng_Latn which I need not explain
eng_Latn some in their own happiness
eng_Latn Perhaps you would like to guide themeditation this time Dog?
eng_Latn hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire.
eng_Latn Does this tent come with any way of stopping it Granny Pug?
eng_Latn but just then the music stopped
eng_Latn the news playing upon him as an icyand congealing breath.
eng_Latn it is superfluous for me to tell you
eng_Latn this awoke the chemist.
eng_Latn he smiled up weakly, reassuringly into her face.
eng_Latn I shall make but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow.
eng_Latn consisting only in morality, history, poetry, and mathematics.
eng_Latn glanced into the mirror which stood on her right.
eng_Latn I thought I could have done some good.
eng_Latn about some ladies they both knew.
eng_Latn but the pleasure she had felt on other days was gone today
eng_Latn I'm sick of everything and everybody!
eng_Latn for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams
eng_Latn to be loved by you or to die.
eng_Latn I was firmly convinced that he had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured it, contemplating it as a possibility.
eng_Latn but his resources were now exhausted
eng_Latn but she had kept it safe
eng_Latn feeling their curses following him
eng_Latn made so violent a discharge as was very offensive to me and my companion.
eng_Latn I hurled my body off the porch, letting the fire rip me apart midair.
eng_Latn since at least a few of them were attractive.
eng_Latn I owns mysef, en I's wuth eight hund'd dollars.
eng_Latn I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.
eng_Latn till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches.
eng_Latn A unicorns!
eng_Latn stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.
eng_Latn I was staying in a hotel.
eng_Latn so they built a waiter trap
eng_Latn but I couldn't see what it was.
eng_Latn he finally disappeared, extinguished by paralysis.
eng_Latn First Pug!
eng_Latn so that he can think the same thing or the opposite.
eng_Latn I planned it, and she only gave in after lots of teasing.
eng_Latn I set down one time back in the woods
eng_Latn for, that you are one, and of those that profess knight errantry
eng_Latn I dont care.
eng_Latn she began to control herself.
eng_Latn It began yesterday when I waswalking past the unicorn club house and sighing...
eng_Latn I am at ease, because I know that if anything were to happen to him, it would be the end of me.
eng_Latn snatched up his glasses, and put them on, then hurried back to the window.
eng_Latn ...I love books...Err. Eh
eng_Latn I read it with pleasure two months ago in the _Periodical Review_.
eng_Latn Dog! Dog!
eng_Latn must be absent on the very day.
eng_Latn the incident appeared to make the worst impression upon his mind.
eng_Latn not having yet had the honor of doing so
eng_Latn but it had started to spill out by the time I arrived.
eng_Latn I don't think you meant to kill anyone.
eng_Latn entirely poleaxed by the idea.
eng_Latn but, however, you had better not interfere.
eng_Latn as soon as the guns of the right wing are heard
eng_Latn as if most of the air had suddenly been pushed out of the gully the flash flood had cut.
eng_Latn I never seemed to get the chance.
eng_Latn opening the door of a room
eng_Latn except when she needed something mended or installed .
eng_Latn perhaps because the pity that he inspired was mixed with love
eng_Latn I did not positively say so.
eng_Latn What are they Commander Action?
eng_Latn I must use my freedom while I feel so much strength and youth in me, he said to himself.
eng_Latn I pretended to be worse than I really was.
eng_Latn with the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished.
eng_Latn softly raising up his right fore foot to remove my hand.
eng_Latn It's been great doing all these adventurous things with you.
eng_Latn but she had not had the courage to renounce her dream altogether.
eng_Latn but when I came to it and opened it I saw that it was a garden room
eng_Latn if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call.
eng_Latn as for example want of shirts, and no superabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments
eng_Latn but perhaps never heard tell of them all their lives.
eng_Latn that extended far and wide
eng_Latn a shivering light filled the compartment.
eng_Latn I, of course, was only too pleased to obey her wishes
eng_Latn OH DEAR. HAVE THEY RUN AWAY?
eng_Latn I looked round
eng_Latn I'd walked ten miles and I wasn't tired.
eng_Latn resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.
eng_Latn I opened the book at random, as she proposed
eng_Latn who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent.
eng_Latn I dared not move.
eng_Latn whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her thoughts so high.
eng_Latn he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.
eng_Latn I gave her a little wine.
eng_Latn than surprise at there being any men in the world
eng_Latn but the psychological feeling was still one of utter exposure.
eng_Latn a sufficiency of cold water
eng_Latn I quitted the chamber.
eng_Latn I love a book at bedtime - with a bedtime doggy biscuit too.
eng_Latn waiting with a defiant and offended face.
eng_Latn I saw his eyes and understood all, at once
eng_Latn my mother burst out crying.
eng_Latn he has become intensely interested in looking after it.
eng_Latn that it was impossible for any body to be a better son
eng_Latn I tried again.
eng_Latn her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory
eng_Latn you have some interest in hiding something.
eng_Latn for he was the main cause of all this thrashing.
eng_Latn is it possible that such things can be in the world
eng_Latn Oooo, can I have a go?
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! I feel a lullaby coming on.
eng_Latn as that unexampled, intelligent malignity
eng_Latn yet should understand how things stood between them.
eng_Latn but over the wall like a thief and a robber.
eng_Latn but consider it a settled thing
eng_Latn he clasped him in his arms so closely
eng_Latn was an elaborately wrought marble tomb
eng_Latn the cossacks went their ways
eng_Latn I have told you my wish
eng_Latn but as far as I know the facts, I can't.
eng_Latn perceiving how foolishly he had acted
eng_Latn objections till at last
eng_Latn Thank you Dave.
eng_Latn swapped it for his wizard's hat at once.
eng_Latn kissed his hand.
eng_Latn the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure
eng_Latn but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour.
eng_Latn I was spared the humiliation.
eng_Latn I was out of bed
eng_Latn besieged by the curiosity and flattery of her new world.
eng_Latn without appearing to notice the different impressions
eng_Latn something stood athwart the road
eng_Latn I smiled at the way he said my name
eng_Latn the sediment that had accumulated at the bottom of her life over the course of so many years
eng_Latn looked at it a moment
eng_Latn then he trod water for a while, thinking hard
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder, Pug!
eng_Latn I shall dream of it all night now.
eng_Latn the little ripple in his nose was a preparation for metamorphosis.
eng_Latn at least, with only the maternal help.
eng_Latn sometimes she had tried prose and sometimes she had tried drama.
eng_Latn Not being cold is what penguins do best Pug. But I don t think they can teach being a penguin to us.
eng_Latn she had become tired of waiting for him
eng_Latn he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief.
eng_Latn all eyes were fixed on the door
eng_Latn his motor car was on the end of the train, and we shot it up.
eng_Latn who is as mighty and strong as if made of brass
eng_Latn bury it in distant parts, to prevent infection
eng_Latn as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack saddle
eng_Latn I haven't got time to go dropping you off all over the country.
eng_Latn I am more convinced of it than you are
eng_Latn jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
eng_Latn it wasn't so much the books I read as the rotten meaninglessness of the life I was leading.
eng_Latn I approached the door I had broken into earlier that week
eng_Latn with the chain up, and peeping out
eng_Latn that his people should not see it and take it from us
eng_Latn I shall attempt to persuade the old lady
eng_Latn I am entirely devoted to the convent.
eng_Latn poised and switched in the air.
eng_Latn COME in, says the woman, and I did.
eng_Latn sworn to as being identically the same hand writing.
eng_Latn the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when
eng_Latn cannot help imagining that the complexity of these conditions is peculiar to himself,
eng_Latn This is a book about drawing allkinds of things and it is called..
eng_Latn that old woman murdered in our district.
eng_Latn for the bow cannot be always bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful amusement.
eng_Latn this fresh misfortune of beingforced to flee by night
eng_Latn I hesitated a moment before going in.
eng_Latn thou art indeed man's father in heaven
eng_Latn but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties.
eng_Latn though the materials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds, carbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds,
eng_Latn but it was evident that he hated him and all his party
eng_Latn looking hastily round
eng_Latn but if he is only a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.
eng_Latn the joint was swollen rather
eng_Latn I hope there is some one else.
eng_Latn now I have seen you and know you are well and have all you require
eng_Latn This is a book all about balancing. And it is called...
eng_Latn with drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored.
eng_Latn so saying he went into the room and the rest after him
eng_Latn he succumbed to the inscrutable fate which is a mans.
eng_Latn You see all that mud that s very muddy over there?
eng_Latn the sweet charm of freshness would leave it.
eng_Latn I apologise if I seemed critical.
eng_Latn That was totally what I meant to do!
eng_Latn but there was no need to tell her yet.
eng_Latn I am so frightened that they are afterwards obliged to take me out of bed
eng_Latn as soon as I was informed of it I let him know how much
eng_Latn penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action.
eng_Latn a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.
eng_Latn I'll cure myself of this.
eng_Latn I've a great mind to go over and tell the old gentleman so!
eng_Latn but still he was the gentleman, with a pleasing address.
eng_Latn I watched the grace of his advance, absorbing it with my new eyes.
eng_Latn she was sure she had put on the bed
eng_Latn Nine steps ... ten ... eleven...twelve -
eng_Latn it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes.
eng_Latn she commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.
eng_Latn the discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event
eng_Latn a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front
eng_Latn I only hope, when you have a son of your own he will make a better return for the pains you spend on him.
eng_Latn I was afraid I was going to have to go to the FBI about it.
eng_Latn he would have found one of the conditions of man's primitive blessedness.
eng_Latn he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face.
eng_Latn I sit down on a nearby chair and peer at the blurry photograph
eng_Latn but that only whetted his appetite, brought it raging up.
eng_Latn I feared that some difference between him and his mother might have led to his being in the frame of mind in which I had found him at the solitary fireside.
eng_Latn I won't cause her pain now.
eng_Latn in case you ever need to defend yourselves
eng_Latn mainly for the purpose of meeting his engineer in chief engaged in the final survey of the road.
eng_Latn so that now I have but a few copecks left.
eng_Latn transportation as well as delivery
eng_Latn had recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with news
eng_Latn the same way he used your mother.
eng_Latn it tickles me, in 1938, to find someone objecting to having a radio in the house.
eng_Latn Writing by Arne Saknussemm.
eng_Latn who you said had 30,000 livres
eng_Latn I must have a superpower!
eng_Latn I have only seen her once before, for a couple of minutes
eng_Latn or resent any legal injustice that might have been doneher son.
eng_Latn I remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty.
eng_Latn so I got up and left him.
eng_Latn to enter on the subject as you wish me to do, will be asking her to tell me whether she returns it.
eng_Latn I told her right away if she wouldgo away for a while while she had her baby
eng_Latn I meant to do that!
eng_Latn just to show how they didn't care and was proud to wear them.
eng_Latn to give him the chance.
eng_Latn but was mortified because no one would understand
eng_Latn remembering how often she had been falsely accused of being arch
eng_Latn for his final words in the event he perished during the adventure
eng_Latn Now lets see if you can get thosemice to sleep and break that World Record. Pug.?
eng_Latn I wheeled it to his couch.
eng_Latn Then I think you re being very brave Pug. Perhaps we have a book in the shop that might help you?
eng_Latn I must run to rehearsal.
eng_Latn even if it makes us scream aloud to die.
eng_Latn come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know....the firstparachute jump was made by a dog!
eng_Latn her great pity had taught her silence.
eng_Latn but your affair will be passed on to headquarters.
eng_Latn reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.
eng_Latn evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics
eng_Latn we are good friends with him
eng_Latn lest if they pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for their presumption.
eng_Latn this will be the third time
eng_Latn she could then exercise all her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she must act.
eng_Latn I can never see his face, but I can see his eyes.
eng_Latn I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.
eng_Latn pulling his pocket handkerchief from over his head.
eng_Latn Bellman, I think we should spilt up to search
eng_Latn having the other firmly grasped by his companion
eng_Latn he accompanied me in the office of watchdog
eng_Latn then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments.
eng_Latn presently died wholly away.
eng_Latn concerning whom he had a strong brotherly opinion.
eng_Latn married a poor clergyman
eng_Latn I told him without missing a beat.
eng_Latn but with a good effort he resolved it into nothing more offensive than a merry smile.
eng_Latn drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler
eng_Latn Hmm Kittens... Kippers..Aah..Kites!
eng_Latn he drank no more.
eng_Latn seeking our adventures
eng_Latn let us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after the bucket.
eng_Latn to assist and take care of me.
eng_Latn Backwards?
eng_Latn he may have upset the case altogether.
eng_Latn I stopped, by chance, at a place by the sea.
eng_Latn Now run right!
eng_Latn because he was in misery, the world must be coming to an end.
eng_Latn they heard a distant roar of fury echoing from somewhere above them
eng_Latn finally arranged with her mother to leave in order that
eng_Latn I am more than fairly well off
eng_Latn wine is only white magic.
eng_Latn flounced out of the shop.
eng_Latn feeling that he ought to go away,
eng_Latn because of her beauty, wealth, position, he had become enormously attached
eng_Latn I stared at her.
eng_Latn let the hen live
eng_Latn drawing his sword
eng_Latn I went here and there collecting it.
eng_Latn but I'll endure it till one o'clock.
eng_Latn I never heard a better sermon.
eng_Latn for want of which I found myself almost stifled.
eng_Latn which they had come to know and todistinguish.
eng_Latn I was startled.
eng_Latn This bridge is as good as new!
eng_Latn I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron
eng_Latn for death is in this house
eng_Latn to what temptations he will be exposed!
eng_Latn I said to restart the conversation so that I could hear her voice again.
eng_Latn I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.
eng_Latn must be liked
eng_Latn where she expected to find his answer.
eng_Latn then all the young clerks in town in a body
eng_Latn fastening it like a girdle about my middle, to hide my nakedness.
eng_Latn I hates folks who can't mind their own bizness.
eng_Latn that hung on her forehead
eng_Latn called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons.
eng_Latn I am his son.
eng_Latn Cow, we think you can. All you needis practice,...
eng_Latn I just met one, and saw him off.
eng_Latn while these girls were rising to more pleasure.
eng_Latn we shall have a gale
eng_Latn it's our fault he's here in the first place.
eng_Latn they, too, sank without trace.
eng_Latn I hope before the day is past to have the upper hand at last.
eng_Latn I have borne all this for you already
eng_Latn encouraged to receive me kindly
eng_Latn but he was by that time clearheaded, and had none.
eng_Latn plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way
eng_Latn it fed the malevolence with which they regarded their neighbors.
eng_Latn now by some strange chain of reasoning he was justifying her
eng_Latn who positively ordered nothing to be altered outside
eng_Latn his successor, at the head of all the _Yahoos_ in that district, young and old, male and female, come in a body
eng_Latn sorrowfully of what had not,happened
eng_Latn till with a sudden recollection she returned to her sewing
eng_Latn I shall remain entirely alone!
eng_Latn for his madness is amusing
eng_Latn went off the sidewalk into the gutter, and sat down hard.
eng_Latn where the steward's high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.
eng_Latn I cannot bear to think that there might be something which I did not know
eng_Latn I'm Susanna Quince and that is my father Peter.
eng_Latn And I think you ve remembered it in all kinds of ways.
eng_Latn his parish was large, the population scattered
eng_Latn but I would have given the world to sit still.
eng_Latn that's not what they wanted for you
eng_Latn Sssshhh! Someone s coming!
eng_Latn I'm practising for my next world record Dog. I'm going to be the first skateboarding pug juggling Bow Wow Snappy Snacks at the SOUTH Pole!
eng_Latn I felt I'd got to get out and have a smell at the spring air
eng_Latn you remember the little chap at the express office
eng_Latn for instance about kissing of hands
eng_Latn they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see.
eng_Latn it was important, therefore, that he should make haste.
eng_Latn A book... A book... Another book!
eng_Latn I can't find the money to meet the bill after all.
eng_Latn made him aware of the too obvious appeal
eng_Latn but an immediate reality.
eng_Latn you'll do more for him than you would for someone else
eng_Latn I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her husband.
eng_Latn but he must have been searched, and his latch key must have been taken from him.
eng_Latn or not as precise as I ought
eng_Latn to find some one quickly to whom he can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill fated creature is born.
eng_Latn no one will believe it.
eng_Latn was that the men who shared his views had no other construction to put on them,
eng_Latn I have heard him tell of it many times, and he got three dollars a week, at first.
eng_Latn paused not once for breath
eng_Latn there was more talk as to why he liked to come out
eng_Latn just as if both had passed through the grave
eng_Latn looked up gratefully to the speaker.
eng_Latn the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.
eng_Latn I had to avert my eyes
eng_Latn And so we say farewell to one of the world s most secret places, whose wonderful and mysterious creatures never cease to amaze. The end.
eng_Latn You re my hero too!
eng_Latn before going down she went into the room where the icons hung
eng_Latn well, next week is a long way off.
eng_Latn for she had the experience of grief, with the certainty that it would not end.
eng_Latn which is all the more curious and all the more precious
eng_Latn you was only a baby, an' you lived.
eng_Latn THOK! and it rose higher than his head and came down and rolled away.
eng_Latn it'll be on your side
eng_Latn I tell her she ought to leave it alone.
eng_Latn even if we are buried down here in the country.
eng_Latn for they told me what was already in my soul.
eng_Latn was tenderer than usual and even more delightful.
eng_Latn tell him where he can find me.
eng_Latn I went to the safe house and found you.
eng_Latn in the first place you must not be so demonstrative.
eng_Latn before I get my dander up
eng_Latn partly because you were poorly
eng_Latn I suppose nobody is really disinterested
eng_Latn I shook the clothes out, snapping them against a tree to beat some of the smell from them.
eng_Latn I love stories that are. . .
eng_Latn I had to get some string.
eng_Latn hearing something snap in his verist.
eng_Latn everybody's a part of.
eng_Latn she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul.
eng_Latn that something would happen
eng_Latn is it so essential to the story to know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be a mistake of one in the reckoning
eng_Latn but the mate for ever sank.
eng_Latn we don't want them to have a chance to sneak past us.
eng_Latn said a gray headed, little old man in a gold embroidered uniform
eng_Latn she glanced towards the sofa beside her, and he instantly sat down.
eng_Latn though I don't agree with you in everything,
eng_Latn Billabong!
eng_Latn the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life.
eng_Latn I felt closer to me again.
eng_Latn I know you haven't
eng_Latn in alittle valise which he found means of procuring.
eng_Latn stopped his sorrel at the steps of the town hall, and waving his whip in the air, shouted to the peasant.
eng_Latn I'm not going to gawp at the celebrities.
eng_Latn that's why he wanted to marry me!
eng_Latn I thought of your face, which from your infancy had the stamp of intelligence
eng_Latn I dab the eye gel on my eyes and force myself to breathe deeply until I'm completely calm again.
eng_Latn I began to feel more uncomfortable than ever.
eng_Latn compressing in a triumphal attitude thatwas some what contradicted by his peaceable air
eng_Latn put his hand on the ice and held it there for several minutes
eng_Latn he said he preferred the train.
eng_Latn he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse
eng_Latn she was also very tired.
eng_Latn only thought of about three days.
eng_Latn that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind.
eng_Latn Once I was fearless! High above the ring I d perform my incredible triple back-flip, single finger somersault and be the best in the World! With this little finger I d spin, up-side-down, on a balancing ball. Faster! And Faster! And FASTER! Till the day I fell. Down.
eng_Latn I didn't even tell my mother till it had healed up.
eng_Latn I know where we can go for supper.
eng_Latn this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?
eng_Latn I think it's wonderful for the time of year.
eng_Latn because of the deep depression into which he had sunk onaccount of it
eng_Latn I daresay it will be homelike enough.
eng_Latn the horror of hearing the screams from the operating ward where amputations were going on!
eng_Latn suppose there were something to this?
eng_Latn stopping to unpack his bundle
eng_Latn pausing for just a moment to let the light spill into the boy's room
eng_Latn my mother and sister.
eng_Latn Wow-Bowzer! Who fancies a snack?
eng_Latn having done this he rode back.
eng_Latn I should choose this if I might,
eng_Latn for 14 years I've been a whore for the advertising industry
eng_Latn then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right.
eng_Latn not to stop till
eng_Latn but I certainly never will be his wife if he becomes a clergyman.
eng_Latn in order to keep his seat
eng_Latn for he grew extremely absent minded, and took to talking to himself.
eng_Latn but a very good doctor.
eng_Latn perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth day at all.
eng_Latn which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some disorder in my brain.
eng_Latn the shipping agent to return to his car and drive away into town
eng_Latn but really I did not expect you.
eng_Latn then she lit a cigarette
eng_Latn his beam of wandlight hit an extraordinary creature
eng_Latn his kind, strong mouth said thoughtfully and deliberately
eng_Latn I'm jealous of monopolising his affection.
eng_Latn lout that you are a real peasant
eng_Latn it was rendered stronger by his friend's confident smile.
eng_Latn I did not care to face him alone in a place of magic.
eng_Latn resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.
eng_Latn she had no vivacity of expression, and it required broad farce to excite her laughter
eng_Latn I wiped my face off on the back of my arm and tried to fix the dress.
eng_Latn These do, but I also have moremodern ways of making them.
eng_Latn then carried the milk into the porch
eng_Latn so you'd better get packed.
eng_Latn his tongue cleaving to the roof of his mouth with all the intensity of thirst engendered by heat and fear.
eng_Latn I pretended to be worse than I really was.
eng_Latn I had seen enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner
eng_Latn the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away.
eng_Latn he must be a man by this time.
eng_Latn he pocketed the bill
eng_Latn but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth
eng_Latn I went inside to change into fresh clothes for school.
eng_Latn that life was more like a great fairy story,
eng_Latn I repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me.
eng_Latn I love books that tell me...
eng_Latn the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin.
eng_Latn our last moment of dim earthly discerning may be like the first.
eng_Latn let me see your pictures.
eng_Latn I came back after dinner, about half past ten
eng_Latn waited with alacrity upon a wave of his hand.
eng_Latn you two go that way
eng_Latn his actions had been forced by the kid's.
eng_Latn he located the right door
eng_Latn in it there was a sick man who required to be bled
eng_Latn I held one hand out to catch her, but she righted herself before it was necessary.
eng_Latn I didn't think about how hot you would be with me gone.
eng_Latn had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it.
eng_Latn but must hack at it with a chopper of cold steel.
eng_Latn therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other places.
eng_Latn that old woman murdered in our district.
eng_Latn I don't want a new career!
eng_Latn let his arms float wide and limp in spite of the pain.
eng_Latn with so little common sense that his two hearers were again filled with wonder
eng_Latn a long, low line of mangrove trees along the horizon.
eng_Latn I was so faint and tired, that the idea of holding out for six miles more, was too much for me.
eng_Latn adding, that if he was bent upon entering it
eng_Latn what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind.
eng_Latn but insofar as he continued to live in the same house with her
eng_Latn which was enveloped in a rag
eng_Latn I dreamed about the stone, as I did all the rest.
eng_Latn for if she was offered to him between two plates the horse would not hanker after her.
eng_Latn Give us a lift to the other side and it's all yours.
eng_Latn not a matter one can comprehend, or consequently enjoy, all at once.
eng_Latn he must be very indifferent to social equipment.
eng_Latn specially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship
eng_Latn Does it walk like a man?
eng_Latn I've had enough of it
eng_Latn for, clearly, money is required for my plan,
eng_Latn no more gaffs and pikes to day.
eng_Latn dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.
eng_Latn the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!
eng_Latn determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner I have related
eng_Latn Hmmm, I'm getting a reading for socks.
eng_Latn evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics
eng_Latn so that, when he awoke startled, he was unable to move
eng_Latn I wrap the chenille throw around me even more tightly
eng_Latn with the pulpit at one end and a huge organ at the other.
eng_Latn killed him for testifying in court.
eng_Latn then made her way back to the unlovely foyer to find a telephone.
eng_Latn I did not know you were an artist.
eng_Latn yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?
eng_Latn I cannot describe the extraordinary callousness with which he made this reply.
eng_Latn lifting the mare's head and letting it go in time with her paces.
eng_Latn took an enormous teapot from the shelf
eng_Latn with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea things in delf.
eng_Latn here he raised his hand as if unconsciously
eng_Latn You d be surprised what is thrownaway.
eng_Latn until at last, one night, came the end.
eng_Latn is a plan in military terms to mount the attack and carry it through.
eng_Latn her bedazzled sweetheart must have lost his mind.
eng_Latn I have told you he was not sympathetic to me
eng_Latn I reckon it's wrong
eng_Latn till he could find nothing more needing his attention.
eng_Latn as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw.
eng_Latn because she made his mother cry.
eng_Latn if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.
eng_Latn that she was himself.
eng_Latn i pulling it out
eng_Latn now he involuntarily fell back two steps.
eng_Latn it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about
eng_Latn the judges never fail of directing accordingly.
eng_Latn I considered the location, and decided she must have tripped.
eng_Latn which was closed for it was midnight
eng_Latn then paced the room
eng_Latn waved it several times in the air.
eng_Latn holding his camera.
eng_Latn it was remarkable how soon, on discovering that they were of the same sex, her manner changed and she dropped her plaintive
eng_Latn I come out of the kitchen
eng_Latn that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.
eng_Latn the princess inherits
eng_Latn forced a measure of very hot potion down his throat.
eng_Latn We are about to go on a journey inside ourselves.
eng_Latn but it did not prevent it getting sprinkled with grey upon his shoulders.
eng_Latn I already know all my letters Dog.
eng_Latn cast your charms
eng_Latn when I closed them
eng_Latn it now remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and antediluvian point of view.
eng_Latn I looked with him.
eng_Latn did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances.
eng_Latn so the entire afternoon went by without a single opportunity.
eng_Latn leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot
eng_Latn soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair
eng_Latn like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
eng_Latn was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over
eng_Latn I thought it might complement your new face, and so it does.
eng_Latn but she was never again to know the careless freedom of her unmarried days.
eng_Latn I'll keep him out five minutes
eng_Latn I am so glad you chanced to come here, prince.
eng_Latn which she had been unable to write all the morning.
eng_Latn rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform.
eng_Latn for permission to purchase and export a quantity of arms.
eng_Latn I sighed and gave her the key.
eng_Latn change the subject and cheer you up by telling you some news that will amuse you.
eng_Latn nothing around them seemed changed
eng_Latn with his long brown hair, all untrimmed, hanging loose about him.
eng_Latn Cat Who Is Curious, would you like to join us on our quest?
eng_Latn that carried ashore the few passengers who had decided to disembark despite the storm.
eng_Latn for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.
eng_Latn I remembered your theory of the affair
eng_Latn he discovered as time went by.
eng_Latn I swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and content
eng_Latn benefactions on all sides and everywhere.
eng_Latn held his breath, watched her.
eng_Latn to see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground.
eng_Latn No no no. I get that a lot. I amHugh (beat) Deanie.
eng_Latn Yip..What are you doing, Dog?
eng_Latn to practice calisthenics orrun and leap as they chose.
eng_Latn it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
eng_Latn show him where to set up the bed for that night.
eng_Latn lingered on the matting, that she might leave her husband quite free.
eng_Latn if I could only get a hundred jalopies.
eng_Latn Ohh Pug does like Pug Rock. And Dog?
eng_Latn his brain was in a turmoil, but not one essential thought in the text had he grasped.
eng_Latn I tried to stay calm, to not panic.
eng_Latn I wish you wouldn't.
eng_Latn but set it on the table again with disgust.
eng_Latn because it has awakened and has begun to beat again
eng_Latn saw them, with a desolate heart, take their places outside, at the back.
eng_Latn but she controlled it soon, and spoke in whispers
eng_Latn he asked sullenly.
eng_Latn I warn you that I shall not admit that you don't know how to write.
eng_Latn I spun sharply around the corner
eng_Latn I myself was personally on duty when the accident occurred, 'I see.
eng_Latn I have now quite settled in my new rooms .
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn began a grave, careful combat
eng_Latn I have had a few aches and pains lately
eng_Latn met with a variety of adventures
eng_Latn to prevent the rabble from crowding about me.
eng_Latn the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats.
eng_Latn he should both dart the harpoon and the lance
eng_Latn before he entered the house.
eng_Latn the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head
eng_Latn I'm always making efforts.
eng_Latn I have now no need to remain here any longer
eng_Latn till we fell into a profound sleep
eng_Latn but he was wrong
eng_Latn I have waited for you with the greatest impatience not that you were worth it .
eng_Latn That s not very nice.
eng_Latn but not done it properly.
eng_Latn fresh tandoori pomfret and crepe suzette on their menu.
eng_Latn holding out his trembling hand for the letter.
eng_Latn went out of the room with meekly downcast eyes.
eng_Latn but unlike the iceberg she has absolutely nothing below the surface.
eng_Latn just at the time when, over and above his other work, he was occupied with some galvanic experiments.
eng_Latn flew in from the street as I entered, and broke one of the large mirrors set in the wall.
eng_Latn but the obvious choice as ever failed.
eng_Latn but after the rosary
eng_Latn each turned his attention to the weapon he would be using on the night of the strike.
eng_Latn I don't think I could stand it.
eng_Latn she looked at her watch till eight
eng_Latn that the next, which they have calculated for one and thirty years hence, will probably destroy us.
eng_Latn glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where
eng_Latn I'm not dancing
eng_Latn frightful old world.
eng_Latn as twilight was beginning to fall, the agent lost trace ofhim
eng_Latn which led, especially among the luckier
eng_Latn from whom he told him to take the carts.
eng_Latn though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shop about even more mysterious things?
eng_Latn they distributed among males over twenty one
eng_Latn it's a great myst'ry
eng_Latn some of my hands being rough
eng_Latn because there had been neither time nor money to bring them out.
eng_Latn I jus' can't seem to think no more.
eng_Latn I had no right to ask.
eng_Latn we heard voices already
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all...
eng_Latn a look of fear came into his eyes.
eng_Latn with a slight bump, they hit the ground.
eng_Latn that now, even though thou repentest
eng_Latn whatever precautions we take
eng_Latn all spun round another way.
eng_Latn but to me, the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world.
eng_Latn I didn t Dog. I just got a bit fed up and thought I d frame him!
eng_Latn surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.
eng_Latn the only luck today that he was the first through to us.
eng_Latn bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off.
eng_Latn for if they have not been of the body they have been of the spirit
eng_Latn he was so far successful
eng_Latn I met her in the street this afternoon,
eng_Latn observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run after the boy
eng_Latn they breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying their appetites
eng_Latn I banged it a good while with one of my sculls
eng_Latn brought them off without any intermediate exasperation.
eng_Latn Are you ready Pug?
eng_Latn whose heads have parted company with their bodies.
eng_Latn took the bucket and carried it out into the back garden.
eng_Latn how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.
eng_Latn when I firs' met you, you reminded me o' me a bit.
eng_Latn I thought it best to leave him alone for a bit to get over it.
eng_Latn until he felt the eyes of a white man upon him.
eng_Latn I must tell you the truth.
eng_Latn I'd go dump it under a tree or something.
eng_Latn the day had grown dark very suddenly, and now there was thick thunder and the sound of rain had swelled.
eng_Latn I shall try to perform them as faithfully as
eng_Latn it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time worn face
eng_Latn tracking animals and finding water.
eng_Latn I ambled along at a slow walk.
eng_Latn the last sound I heard of him
eng_Latn not to hear him she stopped both ears with her hands
eng_Latn dreamt I was at home with my wife and children
eng_Latn as he had done with the skrewt
eng_Latn but they heard a car door slam and they heard voices.
eng_Latn if only you will allow me to act as your escort.
eng_Latn I hesitated to throw my mind frivolously away.
eng_Latn sneezed over the first puff, and then began to cough herself.
eng_Latn I think that will do but it must not be any later.
eng_Latn or nothing but vapour this is surely a noteworthy thing.
eng_Latn I forget what you were accused of?
eng_Latn she had been able to escape the letter itself.
eng_Latn Oh. Ow.
eng_Latn getting shutterclicks of the recent past like blackand white photographs taken by an amateur
eng_Latn if you're hard up
eng_Latn he left two letters for him.
eng_Latn yet I lost all credit with him
eng_Latn my name she muttered
eng_Latn All right. Just a little push.
eng_Latn with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with.
eng_Latn hidden in a cupboard in the castle
eng_Latn that made them men.
eng_Latn the woman turned her head
eng_Latn this will be the third time
eng_Latn you empty her locker and split.
eng_Latn inside and outside.
eng_Latn I was hard pressed to get enough venom into her heart to save her.
eng_Latn but they ain't no shoes to go walking around in on a hot day.
eng_Latn I could swear she was glad to see us when we came
eng_Latn I would add that
eng_Latn for I was sure
eng_Latn what if they'd opened it at customs?
eng_Latn so you must go at once and make a bargain with him.
eng_Latn I was sick, anyway, of counting the number of horseless peasants
eng_Latn don't remind me of your existence again.
eng_Latn I set down one time back in the woods
eng_Latn but not discovering his mistake until he had got half way down it
eng_Latn were the first to climb into the wicker basket, followed by the pilot and six distinguished guests.
eng_Latn We need a safer way to make our newfriend warm and happy.
eng_Latn I would gladly eat a bit of something
eng_Latn upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles
eng_Latn I am beside myself!
eng_Latn I assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your paces, and examine you.
eng_Latn An excellent idea. Come on Pug.
eng_Latn I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world.
eng_Latn of course, one has to say thank you.
eng_Latn my nurse having set me down
eng_Latn taking hold of the gee pole with one hand and swinging his whip from the other.
eng_Latn he was to get the owner's signature and mail me the lease last night.
eng_Latn Before that I tried baking the world s largest dog biscuit.
eng_Latn I've nothing to grieve over and be comforted about.
eng_Latn only of hiding and of crawling, and of death.
eng_Latn will at last be wholly consumed and annihilated
eng_Latn he caught himself smiling
eng_Latn as incredulous of my sanity.
eng_Latn I glanced hurriedly at the door, like a guilty child.
eng_Latn I can't move in with you.
eng_Latn perceived that he was suffering some heavy affliction.
eng_Latn looking back, smelling the glad smell of burning.
eng_Latn I will regard what has passed as not having occurred
eng_Latn for I was going home to the funeral.
eng_Latn BowWowzer Someone s scribbled all over the walls.
eng_Latn which she read by the dim glare of the embers.
eng_Latn if he had admired them.
eng_Latn but felt he must glance at her once more
eng_Latn the delicious repose of the soul on a complete superior had been shaken into uneasy effort and alarmed with dim presentiment.
eng_Latn the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who say that this is perfection
eng_Latn of vital importance for me, and not to be put into words.
eng_Latn the infliction of her unlovable body which people could not bear to see.
eng_Latn I guess it's up to you when you want to leave.
eng_Latn there was the more need for scrupulous watching lest the office should be perverted into a mere question of salary.
eng_Latn laid on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down.
eng_Latn but bruised and battered no doubt
eng_Latn I sighed as I continued in the opposite direction.
eng_Latn I don't understand.
eng_Latn Charles Dickens . 42 . To get to the other side. Now all we have to do is think of the questions.
eng_Latn cried she, throwing back her veil
eng_Latn frozen and icy and clear.
eng_Latn compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn
eng_Latn who did not even respond with a charitable glance.
eng_Latn I believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to accomplish and that is the belief that moves mountains.
eng_Latn I'd never been strong enough to deal with the things outside my control, to attack the enemies or outrun them.
eng_Latn this being amunicipal regulation
eng_Latn it would scarcely be fair to accept your education and then go off and not use it.
eng_Latn I just don't know.
eng_Latn although it in no way disquieted her
eng_Latn one at least had seen a little lugger
eng_Latn being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his mule
eng_Latn seemed the very breath of the strident multi coloured and barbaric population.
eng_Latn sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room
eng_Latn he touched my face.
eng_Latn where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch.
eng_Latn was able to form a clear conception of the man.
eng_Latn I would only set that right.
eng_Latn she assures me
eng_Latn with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays.
eng_Latn but you will admit that I might have done so without his consent.
eng_Latn let all be calm and attend to me as they value their lives!
eng_Latn casting about quickly in her mind for some topic of conversation that would put off the bad moment when the subject she feared would come up for discussion.
eng_Latn he's not a hero!
eng_Latn they found these upon my sleeve.
eng_Latn she was considering whether she would take her with her or not.
eng_Latn I could not now touch this honoured hand.
eng_Latn then unlocked the garage door and ran it up.
eng_Latn she wasn't a teacher to cross.
eng_Latn I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel.
eng_Latn the worst of my suspicions proved too true.
eng_Latn Make it so!
eng_Latn I imagined it was some importunate person who
eng_Latn I'm sure he thought he was hiding.
eng_Latn I shall carry the mark to my grave.
eng_Latn it relieved her sufferings to know that the man had condescended to do so much for those who really wanted his help.
eng_Latn where he buried me alive.
eng_Latn it is time for me to go.
eng_Latn promised to fulfil his most agreeable previsions of marriage.
eng_Latn if he had ground enough to say that.
eng_Latn I never saw people so happy.
eng_Latn I got in on my side and started the car.
eng_Latn except in very special circumstances
eng_Latn few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw.
eng_Latn remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance.
eng_Latn the grass as green as showers and sun could make it
eng_Latn captivity has subdued me
eng_Latn although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse.
eng_Latn went down to breakfast at nine o'clock as usual.
eng_Latn Good evening, Mr. Moon. I'm Dog and this is Pug.
eng_Latn when you think of the grief I ought to be in
eng_Latn in a way I'd never seen anything before.
eng_Latn My brain hurts.
eng_Latn he used to tease the life out of her about it.
eng_Latn it'll be on your side
eng_Latn I do not like the outlines of things to be too sharp.
eng_Latn unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such.
eng_Latn he bent his head, groped with his mouth for hers, found it.
eng_Latn Pug, look out for my book!
eng_Latn I can't believe she's so upset about it, though.
eng_Latn he allas keeps it locked, un' nob'dy iver mells on't but hisseln.
eng_Latn tried to go back to the small square
eng_Latn the finest that was obvious at first being a necklace of purple amethysts set in exquisite gold work, and a pearl cross with five brilliants in it.
eng_Latn I had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress
eng_Latn I'd nodded once, and then turned my face straight forward.
eng_Latn but he was very young, and it was a difficult question to decide.
eng_Latn but merely bowed.
eng_Latn I'll have oursuperintendent see that you're directed to a good boarding house.
eng_Latn till an answer came from the scared porter, and he disappeared under the gate.
eng_Latn a stockbroker with a position of respectability, a wife and two children.
eng_Latn considered for a little time.
eng_Latn I know it's a short notice job
eng_Latn its great lumpy body like a boulder
eng_Latn does not deserve further punishment unless he commits some new offence.
eng_Latn Now is the right time in the story.
eng_Latn the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute
eng_Latn I feel like I've suddenly become part of the royal family or something.
eng_Latn Let's go somewhere we can chill.
eng_Latn but by then it was impossible.
eng_Latn at last, from the week after next to next week, this week, the day after tomorrow, tomorrow, today, tonight
eng_Latn after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks
eng_Latn that there has always been such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement.
eng_Latn We re nocturnal.
eng_Latn but the third which he tried was, from the dull sound it gave out, evidently full.
eng_Latn but, after all, he didn't burn the house
eng_Latn glad to quit my gloomy monitress.
eng_Latn you should be engaged without my knowing it
eng_Latn I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils.
eng_Latn OOw That was Bow-Wowzering!
eng_Latn as he was certain of being tortured.
eng_Latn family joys have no charm for me.
eng_Latn I would much rather take a chair at any time.
eng_Latn you'll get that diamond field off your mind.
eng_Latn which left her with three children who had married and had children in turn
eng_Latn I have taken the liberty of arranging this little
eng_Latn I was going to sell for eighty or more
eng_Latn so I won't complain.
eng_Latn I raised such a lamentation that
eng_Latn he should fear nothing except for her.
eng_Latn smooth haired, bright eyed girl of thirteen
eng_Latn she might be taken away from him
eng_Latn I saw the company was pleased with my behaviour
eng_Latn she added, stuffing more crisps into her mouth.
eng_Latn so I hope this reaches you in time.
eng_Latn but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions,
eng_Latn because he was a man apart.
eng_Latn I'll be up on the four o'clock.
eng_Latn JeanValjean had a complete view of his back.
eng_Latn nor be to blame
eng_Latn I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.
eng_Latn every one of them worth an eye of one's head!
eng_Latn brought up his knees.
eng_Latn Don t panic Dog. My detector can find all kinds of things!
eng_Latn then he seemed to smile.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! I know what you can do.Dave s toys won t be too small. You can both play with those instead.
eng_Latn had beaten and pounded him into exhaustion.
eng_Latn let one of the crew put his finger into the ring.
eng_Latn took himself off on tiptoe.
eng_Latn Do we like corridors Dog?
eng_Latn perhaps she would meet him in some clandestine way and thus obviate all possibility of criticism.
eng_Latn he looked down to see a great cockatoo roasting at his feet.
eng_Latn I've asked him to come down here
eng_Latn he was a man and a brother, without distinction of color
eng_Latn That IS a big question Pug!
eng_Latn she wrote some very pleasant, witty verses and characters in prose.
eng_Latn this one will be turned into cash to day.
eng_Latn I would add that
eng_Latn he had departed without a word, trusting to what might come to him
eng_Latn her father had changed so much that
eng_Latn left it his gun in his hand
eng_Latn left their mark so deep.
eng_Latn was at hand, and managed to snatch him away
eng_Latn I told you we should become friends
eng_Latn I've never rescued a maiden in distress.
eng_Latn she objected, guessing my motives.
eng_Latn haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command.
eng_Latn then he tipped his head forward before he could lose her
eng_Latn he muttered, almost embarrassed.
eng_Latn I hope I shall know her better very shortly.
eng_Latn put your hearts in it!
eng_Latn I don't bear malice about it.
eng_Latn our father's heart burst, he never spoke one of the words that filled it.
eng_Latn that he asked so confidently and precisely
eng_Latn but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
eng_Latn the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road.
eng_Latn who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so.
eng_Latn bending her head back and gazing at him with her exquisite eyes.
eng_Latn I'll say this for him, he always has good licker.
eng_Latn where keen the air, where pale as glass
eng_Latn but now redoubling my efforts
eng_Latn that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the majority first.
eng_Latn they're on their way west already
eng_Latn but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded
eng_Latn before the afternoon was done
eng_Latn climbed over the gate with the intention of discovering whether it were not sweetbriar.
eng_Latn I could never get past that point.
eng_Latn laughed the captain, taking a chewed cigar from his mouth.
eng_Latn but what right have you to say I like him, anyhow.
eng_Latn was placed on the floor, along the wall, in an outer room of the palace.
eng_Latn was studying it with an ink pencil between his fingers.
eng_Latn better by far than that chunk of marble above your head.
eng_Latn considered for a little time.
eng_Latn he told of the with drawal of the 28th regiment from the front
eng_Latn he couldn't get it out again.
eng_Latn I don't know what that means
eng_Latn but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent nature
eng_Latn she might not do the right thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.
eng_Latn which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft. f f flop!
eng_Latn I'll always be in easy reach.
eng_Latn to which the holder of the warrant replied that
eng_Latn but in my love that was I.
eng_Latn An excellent question Dog.
eng_Latn supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that means
eng_Latn I give you these details, in order that your mind may be set at rest.
eng_Latn I have seen a man for the first time in my life.
eng_Latn I'll be safe
eng_Latn I can't do just as I want to here.
eng_Latn I complied at last, finding I could not do better.
eng_Latn in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place
eng_Latn entirely poleaxed by the idea.
eng_Latn Would you like to see some more robots I ve made?
eng_Latn as it was tyranny in any government to require the first
eng_Latn I shall not see her again now before I depart.
eng_Latn advising me to take a little rest, of which I had great need.
eng_Latn I know you can't even pay your taxes.
eng_Latn but they had never before been face to face as they were now
eng_Latn if you would go to the spring dance with me?
eng_Latn one straight before them eastwards, and one on either side.
eng_Latn the first two immediately tied the latter very firmly with the ropes
eng_Latn Once upon a donkey ...No! Once upon a...a...
eng_Latn if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood
eng_Latn I know that sounds backward.
eng_Latn I haven't made a mistake.
eng_Latn of course he was forbidden to ask questions.
eng_Latn I told you he was plain.
eng_Latn not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand
eng_Latn picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase.
eng_Latn stark naked, with an organdy ribbon in her hair.
eng_Latn the horse slipped and fell in the mud.
eng_Latn before the morning were over
eng_Latn her daughter should be married there
eng_Latn daughter were awake and needed anything.
eng_Latn I angrily turned round in bed
eng_Latn appeared to abash the boy
eng_Latn A dog could have painted her daubs. NEXT!
eng_Latn faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment yellow
eng_Latn I did not care to face him alone in a place of magic.
eng_Latn And the first story is called TheTomb Of Doom!
eng_Latn near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle.
eng_Latn but the habitual bent of feeling reasserted itself,
eng_Latn he began to explain how he had failed in his examination.
eng_Latn she yelled, so loudly that he jumped.
eng_Latn hand over my basin and my pack saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.
eng_Latn And Fast, eh? Bow-Wowzer! Leave itto moi. All you have to do is go and get me some more paint.
eng_Latn I thought I heard a horse.
eng_Latn only beauty with him took the place of truth.
eng_Latn opening a door concealed by the drapery
eng_Latn I don't approve of the match any more than you do
eng_Latn I've had the care of our own six horses.
eng_Latn even when she touched him and listened for his breathing, she could not trust her conclusions.
eng_Latn I thought he was just, you know, making conversation.
eng_Latn until I was admonished by the waiter that the gentleman was waiting for me.
eng_Latn your eyes blood shot, like a person starving with hunger and going blind with loss of sleep.
eng_Latn It's hardly surprising. Imaginehaving to go all around the world every night! Even Santa only works one night a year.
eng_Latn the bulk of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers, witnesses, informers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the colours, the conduct, and the pay of ministers of state, and their deputies.
eng_Latn after which he went to my master
eng_Latn the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous.
eng_Latn as if his death had been not his own decision
eng_Latn which had come to him at an age when it is difficult to start life again and to make a new home.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder, Dog?
eng_Latn I forget what they did
eng_Latn that he experienced towards her at the moment a great increase of gratitude and tenderness.
eng_Latn came back to where he had retired near me, and showed it to him.
eng_Latn afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.
eng_Latn I told you, most people are easy to read.
eng_Latn noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her
eng_Latn When this part of the world was adesert - and still is today.
eng_Latn nobody could be!
eng_Latn she had thought much the same herself.
eng_Latn to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship
eng_Latn but no fire engines had come to put it out.
eng_Latn Wow!
eng_Latn he'd never had much practice.
eng_Latn his son lay down too, and fell asleep again.
eng_Latn she paced down the long gallery to her bedroom.
eng_Latn then of the old black woman sitting on her porch.
eng_Latn found them an inch and a half long, and as sharp as needles.
eng_Latn she walked along the platform.
eng_Latn Soggy Dog Biscuits.
eng_Latn not knowing all my thoughts and feelings,
eng_Latn I didn't take it!
eng_Latn I think they ve had a power cut.
eng_Latn like visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden.
eng_Latn a thing happened which caused him to think
eng_Latn he walked into something very large and solid
eng_Latn I love my father
eng_Latn I am quite at home in her house.
eng_Latn riding on a highstanding white horse in front of the first line.
eng_Latn my notes fluttering to the floor like listless birds.
eng_Latn I still don t understand Dog.
eng_Latn but her determination was not to return.
eng_Latn A giant hath captured Pug!
eng_Latn there came a sudden loud screech from behind him
eng_Latn after having half gnawed off the end of a finger
eng_Latn when some one knocked gently at the door of communication with the queen's apartments.
eng_Latn a witness was called to identify him
eng_Latn accompanying her husband on a foreign station
eng_Latn The Great Spelling Contest .
eng_Latn when he didn't need to.
eng_Latn his hands were tied.
eng_Latn he untied the rope which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body, and the knot of which was under the table.
eng_Latn We re slid so far we re in Australia.
eng_Latn the same way he used your mother.
eng_Latn although I did not much admire the conceit.
eng_Latn I quitted the chamber.
eng_Latn tell him where he can find me.
eng_Latn was inclined to think of them certain girls in particular
eng_Latn Yes I do Pug. I like your snow penguin too.
eng_Latn I think that sums up my own feelings too. YIPPPPPPPPPP!
eng_Latn said the count, bowing
eng_Latn I added, as a wretched anticlimax.
eng_Latn at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel walk.
eng_Latn because he had other things to think of.
eng_Latn I found my mother sitting on the coverlet, and leaning over me.
eng_Latn so perhaps some other poor devil has been hanged for it, long since.
eng_Latn This is a book all about a..
eng_Latn I have a partner that I'mgoing to bring around here presently.
eng_Latn but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale
eng_Latn I tell you to cool it down.
eng_Latn I have seen a man for the first time in my life.
eng_Latn I'll learn you.
eng_Latn if we'd caught one of them rascals.
eng_Latn he owed me but fifteen.
eng_Latn but the color was washed out now
eng_Latn still he was opposed to aiding, either by his own countenance or skill
eng_Latn I waded through the middle with my cargo.
eng_Latn it was the air of jubilation about the young man.
eng_Latn because it was not fastened.
eng_Latn for her hatred was not in proportion to her love, but to her disappointed expectations.
eng_Latn I'd done what I could.
eng_Latn he made up his mind to go to their country house to see his wife immediately after dinner, and from there to the races,
eng_Latn they had galloped to him because of his shout
eng_Latn I read it carefully
eng_Latn faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment yellow
eng_Latn she feels that way, as though I were a part of the family.
eng_Latn my mother burst out crying.
eng_Latn which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable
eng_Latn a long time ago when he first told me about himself.
eng_Latn Let's travel back in time – over one hundred years ago, when nights were full of gloom and shadows and...
eng_Latn he was confident that he would make his peace with her.
eng_Latn then mixed bran and oats with a little water for its food.
eng_Latn that it was fetching only five and a half roubles, and that more than that could not be got for it.
eng_Latn I declaimed for five minutes without drawing breath
eng_Latn I made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favour.
eng_Latn but, for all that, the title of first is a great distinction.
eng_Latn where the queen was soon informed of what had passed
eng_Latn nothing ever will happen.
eng_Latn to be so sure he admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.
eng_Latn but not daring, to put her forepaws on his chest.
eng_Latn for to her the father brought a husband,
eng_Latn which ten thousand other men in the world have.
eng_Latn the dream state was lifted as suddenly as though cold water had been thrown over him
eng_Latn then I struck off across the moor
eng_Latn with a slight bump, they hit the ground.
eng_Latn I have myheap of old iron at the bottom of the garden.
eng_Latn withdrew the suggestion because he did not care to offend or frighten her in any way.
eng_Latn but the blood had dried just one lock into a stiff cowlick.
eng_Latn our arrangement made, you have nothing to fear from me.
eng_Latn but his prentice which is a very clever lad sent 'em some medicine in a blacking bottle, offhand.
eng_Latn I clutched at the pale silk that covered my skin, panicking again
eng_Latn but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his drowsiness.
eng_Latn detach himself from the complaining crowd
eng_Latn so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this purpose
eng_Latn between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment.
eng_Latn I haven't heard a word.
eng_Latn L-let s not wait to find out.
eng_Latn for its name could be seen on the poop in gold letters
eng_Latn I have no right to enroll myself in the service of a party.
eng_Latn tell them what he had seen in that hell down there.
eng_Latn who shall be the witnesses of my death before they witness my betrothal.
eng_Latn it probably smelled good to everyone else.
eng_Latn it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with
eng_Latn plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road
eng_Latn but only two large bubbles came out.
eng_Latn All we have to do is walk along this tight rope and climb down the ladder over there.
eng_Latn the man opened it
eng_Latn That looks very big.
eng_Latn but he was a man whose youth was past
eng_Latn I have to thank her for this sprain.
eng_Latn if it was really continuinghad she in the face of such incidents as these
eng_Latn including one window full of beaver hats and bonnets.
eng_Latn but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long.
eng_Latn when he's had the impudence to show it at the last.
eng_Latn And keep your eyes peeled. Thatmonster s here somewhere...
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn so he hastened their departure, which they took at once
eng_Latn I love you.
eng_Latn be attacked by no regrets but her own.
eng_Latn just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood would suit him to live in.
eng_Latn then he found himself before the mangle
eng_Latn but now I have no time.
eng_Latn simply because she was old and poor and had few friends.
eng_Latn for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again
eng_Latn inside he took a six pack of beer from the dead cooler.
eng_Latn So I will play Thisbee instead.
eng_Latn I heard the soft, wet sound of the scalpel across her stomach.
eng_Latn I thank you for the pleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.
eng_Latn lacerate her with the performance.
eng_Latn shut the gate on the mob
eng_Latn I resumed my notice of you.
eng_Latn that isn't anything to anybody here.
eng_Latn to keep her house trim and spruce.
eng_Latn they have for their venial offences whatthey call the coulpe.
eng_Latn to escape a little from the latter
eng_Latn each walked to a table and took her seat.
eng_Latn who had taken the trouble to think about their art, and to think for themselves.
eng_Latn I asked the reason.
eng_Latn but could not, owing to the painful beating of his heart.
eng_Latn wearing a thin silk slip
eng_Latn it was on such a night as this that they had planned to fly.
eng_Latn I was picked up and throwed in the drunk tank a couple of times before I was married, but never was I cuffed.
eng_Latn probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness.
eng_Latn not one of them knew his verses perfectly
eng_Latn at an angle that allowed him to see her reflected in all her splendor.
eng_Latn hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.
eng_Latn bent on finishing a plan for some buildings
eng_Latn he had never quite noticed that before.
eng_Latn whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed
eng_Latn she invited him to play chess
eng_Latn in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed.
eng_Latn I would have expected walls stretching the entire length of the boundaries.
eng_Latn if he be a sensible man
eng_Latn cook their porridge.
eng_Latn (SIGHS) I spent ages making that!
eng_Latn the door having swung open and swung back again without noise.
eng_Latn as it is of no use complaining to you. I mean to complain to your husband.
eng_Latn keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended.
eng_Latn I wish you'd been able to finish.
eng_Latn because he is satisfied that it is for a certain person's benefit.
eng_Latn he said with some asperity to the old man.
eng_Latn for that reason, also, I am glad to see you.
eng_Latn he must sail on, until he struck.
eng_Latn but I did not dare to believe it.
eng_Latn Dog, the mice can dance. I just needed to open a disco!
eng_Latn the grass as green as showers and sun could make it
eng_Latn Oh. I do have a book that can answer that question!
eng_Latn the glow just strong enough to see by.
eng_Latn but you're not going to die about that.
eng_Latn I'm not a magician or a mage.
eng_Latn how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home
eng_Latn getting off his ass briskly
eng_Latn because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals
eng_Latn a very unmelodious laugh she had, I must say.
eng_Latn such constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people.
eng_Latn to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work,
eng_Latn but she never doubted that her decision had been correct.
eng_Latn for, upon some words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay.
eng_Latn remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.
eng_Latn I did it, she said, sounding pleased.
eng_Latn his big hands clutching her by the arm so violently that red marks were left from the bracelet he was squeezing
eng_Latn though he may see ten giants, that not only touch the clouds with their heads but pierce them, and that go, each of them, on two tall towers by way of legs
eng_Latn treating you as if you were in your senses
eng_Latn she broke the hinges and divided the case
eng_Latn pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat down in an armchair and burst into tears.
eng_Latn Would you like to be in my play?
eng_Latn suddenly he remembered how his love had ended.
eng_Latn the front two clutching him tightly
eng_Latn he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.
eng_Latn she would have sold her soul to the devil to marry him.
eng_Latn her face covered by a mantilla to avoid questions for herself and her husband.
eng_Latn but the grade here was very steep and smooth.
eng_Latn there is no doubt the attack must be from the sea, and launched directly from the sea at the palace itself.
eng_Latn inside and outside.
eng_Latn even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him.
eng_Latn I'll give you three hundred dollars and you'll become my mistress.
eng_Latn maybe he's even had to indulge in a purge of the fainthearted.
eng_Latn turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that animal
eng_Latn his bearers listened with breathless interest.
eng_Latn until he grows too old and learns what skin color is all about.
eng_Latn he is not disposed to give his personal attention to the object.
eng_Latn Granny Pug. This is Dog and Pug. Where are you?
eng_Latn where he had of course obtained admission at once
eng_Latn but, what he most noticed in the two figures was
eng_Latn I want a passenger, if it is.
eng_Latn even in the spaces that were supposed to serve as passageways.
eng_Latn Everyone run to the pointy end!
eng_Latn she would never tolerate the idea of having a woman in to help with the housework.
eng_Latn not talking, each content in the company of the other.
eng_Latn spent ten thousand pounds and failed because he did not bribe enough.
eng_Latn as you are doing he'll be angry.
eng_Latn That s what I came back to draw, somore people could visit.
eng_Latn I am so glad you are come.
eng_Latn he pursued the hidden paths of his descent
eng_Latn my shipmates I had left behind
eng_Latn the days, all magnificent, resembled each other like waves
eng_Latn was unable to understand his brother's passion.
eng_Latn or whether she was so full of the subject that she would have talked about it to the very twins
eng_Latn I can see more stars!
eng_Latn I hope it continues to do so.
eng_Latn running a hand reflectively over his bald crown
eng_Latn I was abruptly and unexpectedly anxious.
eng_Latn the means for my return seemed assured.
eng_Latn or nothing but vapour this is surely a noteworthy thing.
eng_Latn I felt my throat tighten in anticipation of her reply
eng_Latn thought that I ought to read something 'improving
eng_Latn about the trouble we were having getting any work out of the darkies
eng_Latn always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist
eng_Latn as I was thus deep in thought and perplexity
eng_Latn they went forward quicker than they had done on their first march.
eng_Latn as if he regretted his outburst
eng_Latn lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf
eng_Latn I'm telling them you all abducted me.
eng_Latn which was a tiny place about eight by six, with a cot and a chair and a dressing stand and some dresses hanging behind the door.
eng_Latn hoping to startle her into a response by asking it when she least expected it.
eng_Latn the countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face
eng_Latn after their walk had continued ten minutes in silence
eng_Latn but I wanted to avoid it except as a last necessity.
eng_Latn sob for the old days.
eng_Latn Dog, I think they remembered the wrong bit of the story!
eng_Latn stealing the part of her grandmother's love that belonged to her.
eng_Latn but was forced to move with extreme difficulty.
eng_Latn gave me the closing cup of tea of the vacation.
eng_Latn then lifted his lip
eng_Latn it blended so perfectly with the dusty floor that
eng_Latn but utterly without any comprehension of the needs of modern days.
eng_Latn but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.
eng_Latn had the spirit to move next to that great authority
eng_Latn to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father.
eng_Latn I should be awfully glad to think that it was he and not I.
eng_Latn Look at me, I'm climbing. Oh. No I'm not. Ooops.
eng_Latn he had waited fourteen years for his liberty
eng_Latn Naughty Hieroglyphics. He ll be introuble now.
eng_Latn then with a rapid, supple movement leaned the whole weight of her body on it,
eng_Latn because a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench
eng_Latn dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
eng_Latn Allow us to be of assistance yourmajesty.
eng_Latn I am she who in the seclusion of innocence led a contented life
eng_Latn This is a book called The Wonderful World Of Kites .
eng_Latn he swung round with a deep flush
eng_Latn met with a variety of adventures
eng_Latn they climbed up into the engine, and advancing very softly to my face
eng_Latn should be alive
eng_Latn with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes, was presented to her
eng_Latn he opened it an inch, so that he could hear her speak low.
eng_Latn would produce against him that fatal register
eng_Latn which was the sign of no mere mechanical sprightliness, but of an eager intelligence.
eng_Latn I had not very much to say.
eng_Latn strange as it may seem to suppose
eng_Latn I'm the servant girl.
eng_Latn I disliked being outdone, so replied with a dozen as solemnly.
eng_Latn we all set on the gallery and had several toddies.
eng_Latn between you and me there was never anything but kindness.
eng_Latn but it's rotten nonsense.
eng_Latn how it rankled inside her, my staring
eng_Latn there was not even an attempt at a black drapery over the wicket.
eng_Latn I can't talk to you here.
eng_Latn I didn't think of my questions again for the rest of that night.
eng_Latn with the help of another man laid his burden down.
eng_Latn easily or not.
eng_Latn I have no parlour tricks.
eng_Latn to give the future sisters in law an opportunity to talk to one another freely
eng_Latn put them safely in his pocket
eng_Latn went out to welcome them with signs of hearty satisfaction
eng_Latn I'll meet you for breakfast in the dining room.
eng_Latn embroiled by factions among themselves.
eng_Latn I know that I have almost ceased to exist.
eng_Latn we went up to his room top story but one , and cried very much.
eng_Latn it seemed to him of no consequence compared with the vision that obsessed his mind.
eng_Latn oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius
eng_Latn was her mulish character.
eng_Latn We have to get him painting again.And fast.
eng_Latn I leave you to what remains of your conscience.
eng_Latn with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going
eng_Latn had she not shown a knowledge of wines rare in a lady
eng_Latn to be ready in the drawing room in half an hour
eng_Latn of course, the first chance I have.
eng_Latn who had kept silent during the life of the deceased elder
eng_Latn watching his father narrowly.
eng_Latn are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown of all good wives.
eng_Latn I was there.
eng_Latn he continued, with a twinkle of genial scorn in his eyes.
eng_Latn his hand was very cold when she shook it.
eng_Latn Dog. Loved. Books.
eng_Latn Granny Pug! We ve been looking for you!
eng_Latn as if tea had the restorative powers of brandy.
eng_Latn parts of it
eng_Latn at least, with only the maternal help.
eng_Latn TEST NUMBER ONE! ALL UNICORNS ARE AMAZING, SO YOU MUST FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH THIS MAZE.
eng_Latn when he would have been glad tohave been anywhere else in the world than out there on the street!
eng_Latn youre my friend.
eng_Latn I was expected to employ myself
eng_Latn it's too long a tale to tell
eng_Latn he wanted to know it
eng_Latn it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.
eng_Latn to contradict this statement
eng_Latn All the bamboo round here has gone.
eng_Latn I dont intend giving anyone else a chance.
eng_Latn Hello. I am Dog, and this is Pug.
eng_Latn I'm ninety three percent sure that nothing bad will happen if he goes to class.
eng_Latn only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in herarms.
eng_Latn the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
eng_Latn now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea.
eng_Latn I ask you to come with me because I want you and your company
eng_Latn At the risk of being tyre-some, maywe suggest that you make tracks?
eng_Latn I got tired of trying to stay away from you.
eng_Latn they heard a little dry cough on the staircase
eng_Latn he says he's lost one eye for good
eng_Latn I'll think about her.
eng_Latn but to wipe the mud from his face
eng_Latn I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight.
eng_Latn the difference was very distressing.
eng_Latn when she could see him getting thin before her eyes, see the torment in his face?
eng_Latn Can I stick this feather in your diary Dog?
eng_Latn I shall say nothing never any more to anybody,
eng_Latn all which with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry plight.
eng_Latn I'll just make the sign of the cross over you, for now.
eng_Latn I always knew he would kill her.
eng_Latn waited for the portrait hole to open.
eng_Latn sighing once or twice
eng_Latn the instrument was on one side, the performer on the other.
eng_Latn the wall thud closed behind them
eng_Latn the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself
eng_Latn it won't do, to keep the clergyman waiting.
eng_Latn but that he had it and peace completeand secure.
eng_Latn it will receive a degree of heat ten thousand times more intense than that of red hot glowing iron
eng_Latn I made them sauce for eighteen pence, and everybody was very much pleased with it.
eng_Latn I accepted the offer before I was able to collect myself.
eng_Latn I'll kick you!
eng_Latn then he put his arms about her in large tolerance and stooped.
eng_Latn but I offered him good wages.
eng_Latn had stated quite clearly that
eng_Latn uttered not a word in reply, and leftthe room.
eng_Latn who had hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.
eng_Latn Hooray!
eng_Latn shipped to his new land free of charge
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer!
eng_Latn he gazed at the opposite bank.
eng_Latn then the people resumed their places and the service continued.
eng_Latn OR we could sing and dance, as people sometimes do in the middle of winter so they don t feel quite so brrrrrrrrr!
eng_Latn I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer!
eng_Latn if you had them, to know who your two legged spaniel was.
eng_Latn he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows.
eng_Latn leave me nothing but my heart.
eng_Latn the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out
eng_Latn no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us.
eng_Latn the nurse picked up the baby and carried it.
eng_Latn a relatively insignificant number, no doubt, but remarkable enough from another point of view.
eng_Latn they had warned her what would happen.
eng_Latn I think I have a book that may help.
eng_Latn I mustn't beg.
eng_Latn greeted her when she came out again.
eng_Latn found it exactly four feet and an inch in length.
eng_Latn situated, as every one knows, upon the highest point of the plain of that name
eng_Latn had chosen it from the others for his place of residence.
eng_Latn yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.
eng_Latn kate laughed and ran her fingers through it.
eng_Latn besides, you will accompany me
eng_Latn you can help them a mighty lot by breaking out that sled.
eng_Latn but he restrained himself
eng_Latn he had come home.
eng_Latn I got a book, and pretended to read.
eng_Latn as if in low spirits from feeding on a too meagre quality of rinsings
eng_Latn And I ll be the brave caveman pirate, who saves the world from the dinosaur aliens!
eng_Latn for the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point
eng_Latn ..I love books that can carry me away to...
eng_Latn the life of a world of strenuous and free activity
eng_Latn in the eyes of the world they were a model couple.
eng_Latn I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,
eng_Latn how sensible the sound was
eng_Latn at last he exploded.
eng_Latn I have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and melancholy day.
eng_Latn the father asked anxiously.
eng_Latn I thought, sir, that it was kings alone who abdicated!
eng_Latn I don't know many who could.
eng_Latn And do you have a very good answer Dog?
eng_Latn How curious. I can hear a clumping,thumping noise.
eng_Latn the irony of it was that the rain had brought a dank chill into the air
eng_Latn nor scratch, before folks
eng_Latn I've never seen you argue.
eng_Latn it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000 francs.
eng_Latn if ever that solitary superlative existed
eng_Latn I am not clear whether it was six or seven.
eng_Latn it broke off suddenly in mid air
eng_Latn I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of your father's life.
eng_Latn but never mind.
eng_Latn in the end, your reward will be to go away with strangers from all the things you love best
eng_Latn I fought my way against the stubborn storm.
eng_Latn this has come upon me so suddenly I had not thought
eng_Latn as if they had been pigmies and I a giant.
eng_Latn pretty nearly promised,moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.
eng_Latn over there on the north side of the gulf.
eng_Latn writing and arithmetic succeeded
eng_Latn but I did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.
eng_Latn then pushed the paper a little way from him
eng_Latn show me the country
eng_Latn perhaps in him you will kill one of your enemies, the enchanters.
eng_Latn each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth.
eng_Latn I'd bet he's keeping it close to home.
eng_Latn compressing in a triumphal attitude thatwas some what contradicted by his peaceable air
eng_Latn they'll ask no questions after him
eng_Latn if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world
eng_Latn when he opened the door, at seeing me here!
eng_Latn I just took that because it was the only chance I saw of getting up to town.
eng_Latn I look at him as though for the first time
eng_Latn I could not believe that I had said the name at last.
eng_Latn but I lay I'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country.
eng_Latn where they designed to pass the rest of their lives.
eng_Latn he shook his head
eng_Latn I won't stay more than a minute.
eng_Latn he made him his theme.
eng_Latn I've got no education.
eng_Latn if he himself had said that
eng_Latn for there was no other fish to give him.
eng_Latn with hardly enough to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman,
eng_Latn but they continued to exist.
eng_Latn she was probably eager to bed everyone else.
eng_Latn that he was out here, and so cause her to come out.
eng_Latn the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand
eng_Latn I'd seen some of this in other students' heads.
eng_Latn always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.
eng_Latn where I might at least preserve myself some hours longer, than by being shut up as I may call it in the hold.
eng_Latn but you're why I stayed.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Dog.
eng_Latn which fell over the garden like an immenseblack pall.
eng_Latn did they have the opportunity to speak to each other.
eng_Latn all was in the same posture
eng_Latn I shall go to see them from time to time.
eng_Latn I think I can kick it open if yousay so.
eng_Latn in a fascinating but decorous d'shabill'.
eng_Latn with big galoshes drawn over them.
eng_Latn Who will be played by Susanna.
eng_Latn but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him
eng_Latn Go boil your socks!
eng_Latn in any case, I have a rule in this school that
eng_Latn the skin over his left temple puckered
eng_Latn only that vague something which I knew I'd seen before.
eng_Latn But if something does make it stop...
eng_Latn suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to.
eng_Latn in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains.
eng_Latn if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.
eng_Latn a false step plunged us more than once thigh deep into the dark, quivering mire
eng_Latn basing his refusal on the ground that the applicant was a notorious gambler and cheat
eng_Latn This is a world within our world.
eng_Latn This is a book about incredibletrue things, and it is called The Amazing Book of Amazing Facts.
eng_Latn My name is Pug and this is Dog.
eng_Latn a talk with a beekeeper she met
eng_Latn as if it would be unreasonable to suppose anything else of him.
eng_Latn but the effort required to fill thebucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step.
eng_Latn sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face.
eng_Latn that had been half shaved, was again covered by short hair.
eng_Latn who was at that time away at the front, though she was expecting him soon to return.
eng_Latn to join this assembly
eng_Latn then, through the fog that was drowning him
eng_Latn said a girl with blonde pigtails anxiously.
eng_Latn he was sure of what he was going to hear.
eng_Latn in a very thoughtful mood, which turned rapidly into a depressed one.
eng_Latn Splatt splatt splatt?!!
eng_Latn it was the only honorable way to make a profit out of poetry
eng_Latn of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers.
eng_Latn he left us with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.
eng_Latn I gave him a sufficient dose of veronal to insure his unconsciousness for several hours.
eng_Latn we would give it to him, and, indeed, I myself would give him as much as he wanted out of my own money.
eng_Latn I see no reason why I shouldn't make a few acquaintances hereabout.
eng_Latn Pug, what are you doing now?
eng_Latn though he knew no other language
eng_Latn bent his bow against a damsel who stood between the turrets of the castle
eng_Latn though he knew the business inside out
eng_Latn he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water
eng_Latn nobody said anything
eng_Latn I look up blearily.
eng_Latn I feared a reverse for him
eng_Latn the two or three customers fallen forward asleep
eng_Latn the enormity of her relief showing in the way she sat
eng_Latn as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw.
eng_Latn posters of seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes
eng_Latn I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself, but I couldn't seem to make it go somehow.
eng_Latn we are neighbors, and you needn't think you'd be a bother.
eng_Latn the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.
eng_Latn it was only a matter of waiting a little and he was bound to get a well paid job to design costumes and draw posters.
eng_Latn That is very clever!
eng_Latn I discovered presently that a peculiar story was circulating among her friends.
eng_Latn I knew immediately that it was a big bug.
eng_Latn after dragging from her those things which were most precious to her and trampling on them
eng_Latn it was absurd to care what an anaemic little waitress said to him
eng_Latn but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great
eng_Latn I don't think I could restrain myself if I ran into your other friends again.
eng_Latn I would not, therefore, immediately charm the snake.
eng_Latn sat her on the bed, and began undressing her.
eng_Latn was the unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.
eng_Latn obviously not at all wishing to let him go.
eng_Latn he carried nothing but his revery, however.
eng_Latn the shop was not closed
eng_Latn made one think of too many eyes behind the curtains.
eng_Latn to play the love waltz he had composed for her
eng_Latn I was torn between the fear of hurting a nice woman's feelings and the fear of being in the way.
eng_Latn the hour, the circumstances,the surroundings,were in keeping with it.
eng_Latn felt the air behind him.
eng_Latn hich within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling.
eng_Latn even pouring out her joy at the thought of devoting herself to him
eng_Latn the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.
eng_Latn I mean, in a modern marketing environment, I think we need to be looking at a fusion of strategy and forward thinking vision
eng_Latn that to compass his ends
eng_Latn has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.
eng_Latn but I had to deceive him about it, or he would have been angry.
eng_Latn I have orders to give this into her hands myself.
eng_Latn such as a part made up, or added later.
eng_Latn their own five and one more.
eng_Latn understand how far to carry their obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned.
eng_Latn I got so full of it I didn't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded.
eng_Latn Again Pug?
eng_Latn we arrived at my city
eng_Latn I didn't do that.
eng_Latn get that five dollar gold piece out and go to town.
eng_Latn I will do it yet.
eng_Latn my real treasure is not that my dear friend it is your presence our living together five or six hours a day in spite of our jailers
eng_Latn I am sure she'll tell you I'm affectionate.
eng_Latn it slid out of the window into the back seat of the car.
eng_Latn with a bundle of oranges tied up in a handkerchief.
eng_Latn heaven grant that your wishes and mine may be realised
eng_Latn only the remnants of the lace curtains remained, clean but obviously mended.
eng_Latn but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something
eng_Latn I saw the naturalist pause at the door of an out house in the corner of the orchard.
eng_Latn her thoughts wandered in a confused maze
eng_Latn I'm due back at nineteen thirty.
eng_Latn he left its arrangement to others
eng_Latn now four years in her grave
eng_Latn his youngest son, sat next to him
eng_Latn but the child's delight was to go out with the good man.
eng_Latn then we'd have no blessed miscalculations
eng_Latn reflected that the very apparent insignificance of his aim would help him to success.
eng_Latn I mentioned to you yesterday what was the state of my affairs.
eng_Latn they heard the street door close
eng_Latn that no one could explain how they had time to grow old.
eng_Latn that though I once was so ill that I really was little better than an idiot
eng_Latn the injustice with which he had accused her of affectation, of artificiality, aroused her.
eng_Latn all the while sensing that she was really doing nothing for herself because
eng_Latn he had succeeded after a hard struggle in throwing off his sorrow like an empty shell.
eng_Latn I love this job, Dog.
eng_Latn limber, portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast.
eng_Latn not talking, each content in the company of the other.
eng_Latn I didn't recognize the male voice, fierce and deep
eng_Latn so I guess I better make sure you're not going to die on his hands.
eng_Latn for he would undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he pleased.
eng_Latn at the end, almost too weak to speak
eng_Latn the count will do me the justice
eng_Latn I'm trying to stay outside the loop.
eng_Latn or to learn from you where he is now.
eng_Latn but decided not to.
eng_Latn he clicked the lever and spoke again immediately.
eng_Latn he allowed himself to be carried along by curiosity.
eng_Latn leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him
eng_Latn locked the gate behind us, and took out the key.
eng_Latn you wait 'til you hear this
eng_Latn leaping back a yard with the speed and security of a trained gymnast.
eng_Latn I have no money to pay my bill
eng_Latn for the matter concerned his mother.
eng_Latn on seeing which
eng_Latn now you've only to try to do the second half and you are saved.
eng_Latn I realised in myself the same desire as animated him.
eng_Latn but he was well satisfied to remain and to subsist miserably on the proceeds of a bale of cotton a year and the charity of his neighbors.
eng_Latn I do not mention, or intend, to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for whom I have all manner of respect
eng_Latn but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside
eng_Latn only start her like grim death and grinning devils
eng_Latn when the young man entered, I am sure I knew what he had been doing.
eng_Latn I was timidly following her
eng_Latn but now I have no time.
eng_Latn as he did yesterday through impatience to search the rooms, to see
eng_Latn another about second from the bottom which was cold as ice.
eng_Latn Hold tight, Pug. I ll come and get you –
eng_Latn so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me!
eng_Latn the bar of the ken I went up there and see it with my own eyes is filled with traps.
eng_Latn I may have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister.
eng_Latn if they were all of the same size with him that I saw.
eng_Latn I had my own old plate
eng_Latn it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south and south east
eng_Latn bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused.
eng_Latn that devil, that goes about there so busily, has firm flesh
eng_Latn I didn't see where that was so much better.
eng_Latn I'm not going to think about that for approximately six and a half more years.
eng_Latn than to burn like a meteor and leave no dust.
eng_Latn afterwards, he may come to fold us in his arms as our mother did
eng_Latn had in part lost his mind from worrying.
eng_Latn which is the third place of trust in the realm.
eng_Latn imagined its raptures and made them her own.
eng_Latn There s no Yeti?
eng_Latn it's really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.
eng_Latn although he has rather chosen to follow other authors.
eng_Latn had agreed to return to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection.
eng_Latn not since that night in the barn after the police had brought him home.
eng_Latn unbolt the side passage door
eng_Latn moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle.
eng_Latn but it was only mingled with other causes in making her more conscious of that new alarm on his behalf
eng_Latn now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind.
eng_Latn she felt to her own want of spirituality.
eng_Latn I poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase.
eng_Latn he was so sleepy that he fell asleep at once.
eng_Latn but I was obviously dreading him dying, wasn't I?
eng_Latn where he will be staying for the next three days.
eng_Latn I wasn't embarrassed.
eng_Latn that he was either unsuccessful or ill fated where girls were concerned was false.
eng_Latn cried the three girls
eng_Latn blocking his progress.
eng_Latn I joined the ring of players, while the rest of the crowd massed itself around me.
eng_Latn I bet they didn't!
eng_Latn Where s here?
eng_Latn turning it around, studying its facets.
eng_Latn at which I took the liberty of knocking, in hopes some more civil servant might show himself.
eng_Latn who was evidently looking for her
eng_Latn not to lookat him, and to flee at the best speed of one's legs.
eng_Latn had the happiness to be dead a hundred and twenty years ago
eng_Latn This place is the pits Dog.
eng_Latn our folks had paid good solid money for it
eng_Latn then an idea suddenly struck her, which made her shudder
eng_Latn by a continued exertion of strength and ingenuity
eng_Latn your abundance will flow forth from it.
eng_Latn I no longer suffer.
eng_Latn I feel like I've suddenly become part of the royal family or something.
eng_Latn a man who took a fancy to him and who could both swim and dive, he learned to do both exceedingly well.
eng_Latn took up her knitting.
eng_Latn consciousness and pleasure were likely to be more than momentary in them.
eng_Latn I wandered up to the church.
eng_Latn he used to tease the life out of her about it.
eng_Latn but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run.
eng_Latn The hattiest of all.
eng_Latn while I saw her in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench
eng_Latn for under serious circumstances you may be called before the tribunals in order to enlighten the minds of the magistrates
eng_Latn were steadiness and diligence.
eng_Latn the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases.
eng_Latn say her dress still hanging at the foot of the alcove
eng_Latn when she looked up and saw what caused it
eng_Latn he was beside her.
eng_Latn I lost a husband.
eng_Latn once again led him onward on his journey.
eng_Latn Dogstar One, come back!
eng_Latn returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm
eng_Latn since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced.
eng_Latn Reynard! Todd! What have I toldyou?
eng_Latn took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream.
eng_Latn Pug, would you take a photograph of me for the back of my book please?
eng_Latn we turned together down the path.
eng_Latn except that she didnt want me.
eng_Latn but was afraid even to think about it.
eng_Latn for to engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed knight.
eng_Latn the conversation ended at a point as far from the beginning as some recent sparring between the brothers in law at a vestry meeting.
eng_Latn then plunged down as if from a spring board
eng_Latn THE LESSER SPOTTED KRAKEN!!! (BEAT)What s that Granny Pug?
eng_Latn he is only a parson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.
eng_Latn though he had heard hardly anything, understood everything in his own way.
eng_Latn already getting ready to change back again.
eng_Latn I shook my head in despair.
eng_Latn I'll return for him then.
eng_Latn the friend whose life was delivered into his!
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn which he did, holding his breath.
eng_Latn you will show us the nest places.
eng_Latn These are... people!
eng_Latn there's the window and the rod
eng_Latn have no objections to him being a card holder.
eng_Latn It's only me Pug. I'm acting.
eng_Latn but she's too mad to think of it now.
eng_Latn we cancross question them by the week
eng_Latn puffed for a minute or two in silence.
eng_Latn for the walk was long and bleak.
eng_Latn now he hoped with all his heart that it was his brother.
eng_Latn he did not then press his inquiries
eng_Latn how long before someone asks him to rig up an electric chair?
eng_Latn she promises to repay them very speedily.
eng_Latn I had weary days of it.
eng_Latn they took the spade and the pick there.
eng_Latn though perhaps I ought to make you an exception there.
eng_Latn Shakers... Shaking..aah. Shakespeare.
eng_Latn that had given him no peace since the beginning of the voyage home.
eng_Latn there's time enough!
eng_Latn he had ever seen in his life.
eng_Latn it was, perhaps, some plot against you.
eng_Latn how hemust have worked to get all of these people here to testify againsthim!
eng_Latn she hadn't kissed him in a passing weakness when she had kissed him
eng_Latn is surely more than a triumph for self love?
eng_Latn I sat up and saw the battle over
eng_Latn I forbid you to tell the boy anything!
eng_Latn when my crew conspired against me
eng_Latn I lost at least two years of my life
eng_Latn a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken door flew open and a flood of light from two torches pervaded the apartment
eng_Latn But I have LOTS of drawings I still want to show you. Look...
eng_Latn whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life
eng_Latn I don't know.
eng_Latn I am delighted to meet a compatriot.
eng_Latn nobody can doubt that.
eng_Latn others flew about my head and face
eng_Latn it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.
eng_Latn But most of all and best of all..
eng_Latn who was wearing swimming trunks and was holding his wand ready.
eng_Latn drew more than one tear from some of the listeners
eng_Latn heard suddenly the rumble of the trap.
eng_Latn A feeling that someone was watchingus?
eng_Latn its so long since weve seen each other theres nothing much to say.
eng_Latn or the darling has lived with me
eng_Latn maybe never have another chance.
eng_Latn being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting room
eng_Latn he called to the baronet to join him there.
eng_Latn for you are dearer to me than anybody can conceive.
eng_Latn for he was a hero and don't let anyone tell you differently.
eng_Latn to avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.
eng_Latn I ve written LOTS of stories since I saw a little bit of it in the jungle.
eng_Latn all those who had loved him dropped out of his existence.
eng_Latn I gave persuasion another try.
eng_Latn feel at least hidden, if not secure.
eng_Latn he had waited until eleven o' clock
eng_Latn We are not, Dog. We thought this game would be fun but - YIP!
eng_Latn stooping over and dili gently working away at the space between his legs.
eng_Latn he resolved to absent himself from his house for eight days
eng_Latn Steady does it!
eng_Latn expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt.
eng_Latn whose novelty was a harp in the orchestra
eng_Latn no one else was looking.
eng_Latn I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose, and puffed a bit.
eng_Latn ...I love books that ask big questions like...
eng_Latn Let's get baking!
eng_Latn she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.
eng_Latn saw that it was nearly eleven hundred
eng_Latn or without thinking about the other
eng_Latn swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery
eng_Latn This is a story about a race thattook place in Australia, and it is called
eng_Latn but place now against it a lighted candle as a centre of illumination, and lo!
eng_Latn I look at him, puzzled.
eng_Latn jus' round this bend here.
eng_Latn my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.
eng_Latn I am glad you are here with me.
eng_Latn At your service.
eng_Latn it's so easy to get nervy and irritable.
eng_Latn as it were, by simple exercise of will, increasing and slackening speed and turning his course.
eng_Latn stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.
eng_Latn And you dug a hole.
eng_Latn you two come right after us
eng_Latn ike a large box or a small trunk.
eng_Latn she had stepped into the garden, with the impulse to go at once to her husband.
eng_Latn I heard him say so.
eng_Latn so that the whole inn was nothing but cries, shouts,
eng_Latn the committee left their seats, and stretched their legs on the terrace.
eng_Latn as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife.
eng_Latn I know that sound.
eng_Latn they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him.
eng_Latn the young shepherd lay dreaming in the sun.
eng_Latn I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks.
eng_Latn they whispered to one another
eng_Latn I think you ought to love me
eng_Latn had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who
eng_Latn taking up a pack he prepared to deal.
eng_Latn I pushed open her door and looked around her room.
eng_Latn unless some one helped him.
eng_Latn but let this stand over for some more convenient time
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat will show us the real reason.
eng_Latn that it's hardly possible to give him as much praise as he deserves.
eng_Latn it was about fifteen years old
eng_Latn a few steps farther
eng_Latn you can't help being sorry and pitying me.
eng_Latn I confused Dog.Why wouldn tCamille come to her own party?
eng_Latn but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise.
eng_Latn but his uncle's kind remembrance delighted him
eng_Latn the village was behind them.
eng_Latn his was that worst loneliness which would shrink from sympathy.
eng_Latn chastely perched on the farthest edge of the mattress
eng_Latn Blowing
eng_Latn I want the truth, the truth!
eng_Latn I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank
eng_Latn you looked through me, and frowned
eng_Latn but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands
eng_Latn she would get her own back in some way or another.
eng_Latn he wrenched it off the chain, and crushed it with his foot.
eng_Latn he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.
eng_Latn he must promise before they left.
eng_Latn I believe I have lived single long enough not to make a mistake in that line.
eng_Latn I don't like to discuss this sort of thing on the phone
eng_Latn I come out of the kitchen
eng_Latn another section at the rear of a paved patio, where the factory had been located
eng_Latn she was the exact opposite of my mother
eng_Latn I can read you like a book but control yourself.
eng_Latn I can't say that I'd rather die than be this way.
eng_Latn when it was learned that the announcement of the pontifical visit had been a lie spread by the government
eng_Latn With music!
eng_Latn it was as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.
eng_Latn I was in the box room at the time
eng_Latn said she could not enter.
eng_Latn I suppressed a sigh.
eng_Latn I can mend bones in a second
eng_Latn but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.
eng_Latn I didn't say any more
eng_Latn she said nothing aloud.
eng_Latn and sleep seeming to be her likeliest friend,
eng_Latn she played afterwards.
eng_Latn Hold on tight everyone.
eng_Latn while he looked at her like an aged hyena
eng_Latn how I hate them
eng_Latn I assured his honour, that the law was a science in which I had not much conversed
eng_Latn but, however, you had better not interfere.
eng_Latn but his moral machinery was still out of gear.
eng_Latn They are amazing! But thelight from the lighthouse must sweep around in a circle.
eng_Latn conquers the king's enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles
eng_Latn but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him
eng_Latn his expression was icy and hostile.
eng_Latn he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding.
eng_Latn he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her.
eng_Latn she ran for safety to her own room, and, locking herself in
eng_Latn they can't all be bad!
eng_Latn Pug, I think you ve just solved our problem!
eng_Latn except through cowardice,
eng_Latn I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!
eng_Latn now it seemed wrong to refrain.
eng_Latn what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so dry that he lost his wits.
eng_Latn I'd better lay low and keep dark, and not write at all
eng_Latn the grounds of the loony bin weren't likely to be more than five or ten.
eng_Latn I don't know much, perhaps, but a new life has begun for me.
eng_Latn between the madness of women andthe madness of men.
eng_Latn See you in my next book boys.
eng_Latn that his brother in law had proposed to her and been refused.
eng_Latn to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone's lackey
eng_Latn subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary
eng_Latn the hide merchant and his servants had seen three men on the road arrested suspiciously, with their horses' heads together.
eng_Latn but if you did not think then, try to act like a man now.
eng_Latn I also am a prisoner of the healers.
eng_Latn but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay.
eng_Latn he continued, with a twinkle of genial scorn in his eyes.
eng_Latn that when you met yesterday you made yourself known to him with tears of joy.
eng_Latn but to each of us he has given the responsibility of NAVIGATION.
eng_Latn behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality.
eng_Latn no doubt he does not feel inclined this evening
eng_Latn made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid across two barrels.
eng_Latn they shook hands again.
eng_Latn then as I was hurrying off
eng_Latn I'm not going to stand by and see you suffer.
eng_Latn thou shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time
eng_Latn I, taking her to the lift afterwards
eng_Latn like a good brother, she answered demurely.
eng_Latn I chipped in and said
eng_Latn he is admirably adapted to revive one's spirits
eng_Latn she replied amid loud laughter that she did not think it was right for men to be superstitious.
eng_Latn too busy resenting the inference that she herself had made just as big a mess of things.
eng_Latn he never recognized him as his son before the law
eng_Latn or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood
eng_Latn she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning
eng_Latn flinging herself into a chair
eng_Latn One does like to escape the palace and run free from time to time.
eng_Latn he was naked with the women who had helped to entrap him.
eng_Latn one in the other loosely clasped.
eng_Latn you was only a baby, an' you lived.
eng_Latn if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.
eng_Latn now be quiet
eng_Latn promised to let each other know how things went with them
eng_Latn but she's certainly too old for you to marry.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!And now I know what people used before electric lights and batteries -
eng_Latn I took her out of a bad house
eng_Latn I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity.
eng_Latn as I feel quite sure your story will do.
eng_Latn but all the same
eng_Latn waved it several times in the air.
eng_Latn when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle.
eng_Latn I gave him the other
eng_Latn An echoooo?
eng_Latn It's a wonderful snail Dog. His eyes are on stalks!
eng_Latn I came without any and I've been worried ever since.
eng_Latn there take a cab
eng_Latn it was a gentle and pensive farewell to an unhappy soul.
eng_Latn you annihilated my poor sketch with your criticism.
eng_Latn I don't know what you want me to say.
eng_Latn I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war.
eng_Latn when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black
eng_Latn And nine...and ten!
eng_Latn its after effects showed how deep the sorrow sunk.
eng_Latn when she turned back the expression was gone.
eng_Latn I doubt it even understands the concept.
eng_Latn he and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world.
eng_Latn I do think it would be better to wait, said the latter.
eng_Latn with that he gave me a twitch
eng_Latn It was great finding out all those facts Pug.
eng_Latn I promised mamma that I wouldn't say one word to him, and I didn't.
eng_Latn I wasn't big enough to frighten by looks alone.
eng_Latn though by no means new to his own mind
eng_Latn I fell asleep in her arms, after that, and slept soundly.
eng_Latn not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover.
eng_Latn I shall make something of you.
eng_Latn I think you should eat something, I disagreed.
eng_Latn We re not people.
eng_Latn was easily accounted for as belonging to the sense of haste
eng_Latn cracked her head on the leg of a table.
eng_Latn Me too. We ve got a smallproblem though. The magic pillow is empty
eng_Latn though I may wish it unsaid the next moment.
eng_Latn I will write, what I enjoy writing
eng_Latn was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice of his profession.
eng_Latn they shed blood they had no right to shed.
eng_Latn but he seemed to think it hardly probable that your uncle would consent.
eng_Latn especially because she would order for the children their favorite puddings
eng_Latn ou bring it, missy, and lay it down here
eng_Latn He begged him to come down to where they stood.
eng_Latn I only told you that in the goodness of my heart.
eng_Latn bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a deep sigh.
eng_Latn I need not tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside.
eng_Latn but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others.
eng_Latn I observed, she behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest
eng_Latn Happy birthday Dog.
eng_Latn he's from nice folks, as you know, and he's honest.
eng_Latn I went a good deal into that, at one time.
eng_Latn to where the village lay drowsing in the sun.
eng_Latn but the expression in them had not altered since the days of her unworried girlhood.
eng_Latn but which had protected him from an awareness of his age.
eng_Latn opening her arms wide, took my curly head within them, and gave it a good squeeze.
eng_Latn in order that there might be no misunderstanding or painful sense of doubt and mystery between them.
eng_Latn Do not be alarmed, Pug, but I amhaving that same feeling right now.
eng_Latn just as he had kissed his brow on the preceding evening.
eng_Latn in the foreground, a head, a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it.
eng_Latn returning them thanks for their kindness to us
eng_Latn fading away in the radiant light of noon.
eng_Latn swift as the arrow it speeds.
eng_Latn his eyes closed.
eng_Latn he was going to commence eating, when the inclination appeared to become suddenly extinct.
eng_Latn I guess he thought leaving them there was all the suicide note anybody would need.
eng_Latn the monster in my head agreed.
eng_Latn I remembered my fishing rod and the smell of sainfoin
eng_Latn when I need feeding every few hours?
eng_Latn while my colour came and went several times, with indignation.
eng_Latn I wasn't in a very good mood
eng_Latn I'm like that bug, he thought resentfully
eng_Latn then I've found him and I want to go to bed with him.
eng_Latn having to his father's disappointment taken to books instead of that sacred calling business.
eng_Latn she drew from her pocket a very thick black veil
eng_Latn without even removing his glasses
eng_Latn I let myself drop from the top of a roof, and here I am.
eng_Latn then it's all right to let him serve.
eng_Latn as he demonstrated by several experiments
eng_Latn pouring out a steaming beakerful
eng_Latn I am perfectly aware of it.
eng_Latn but the housekeeper, anxious to gain another listener, stopped him
eng_Latn but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him away.
eng_Latn Shall we read on?
eng_Latn I'd still got plenty of money in the bank, nearly two hundred quid
eng_Latn I do this of my own free will.
eng_Latn to begin the morning's work.
eng_Latn if they ever wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps by which the soul travels to its primeval abode.
eng_Latn No. I can t. I'm a clown now.
eng_Latn she felt him wince.
eng_Latn it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift to get to the palace without trampling on any of the people.
eng_Latn she let her work rest on her lap
eng_Latn Neither am I.
eng_Latn the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay
eng_Latn but they're cinches.
eng_Latn hoping to catch the sound ofhis voice
eng_Latn I soon became at least as expeditious and as skilful as either of the other boys.
eng_Latn or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman.
eng_Latn this time observing all of the works of art on the ceilings and the walls.
eng_Latn not quite certain.
eng_Latn she recognized him immediately.
eng_Latn when you think of the grief I ought to be in
eng_Latn so how can I hope for divine forgiveness?
eng_Latn once beside his son he seemed embarrassed and strange.
eng_Latn I wish I had never come here
eng_Latn till we start south.
eng_Latn so that he did not think he was going beyond the bounds of condescension, nor, on the other hand, making a mistake, in inviting the young couple.
eng_Latn dressed in a yellow print gown, with a white kerchief on her head.
eng_Latn I believe I have lived single long enough not to make a mistake in that line.
eng_Latn then licked some up on his tongue.
eng_Latn determined, if he saw him make any hostile movement
eng_Latn striking his head against a stone
eng_Latn the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous.
eng_Latn There are NO sausage rolls!
eng_Latn don't you go for to bring any of them other young whelps
eng_Latn And this?
eng_Latn to withdraw a considerablesum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers.
eng_Latn proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.
eng_Latn pulled on the spare ones
eng_Latn after breakfast haddock, grilled kidneys, toast and marmalade, and a pot of coffee I felt better.
eng_Latn she was instantly upon her feet again
eng_Latn she had been able to escape the letter itself.
eng_Latn so she resolved to stay and get out of the scrape as she could.
eng_Latn Hey!
eng_Latn as if, not being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones
eng_Latn Yes - of course. The diary.
eng_Latn villainy were practised
eng_Latn I do not think anything would justify me in wishing you to sacrifice all your happiness merely to oblige my brother
eng_Latn with many compliments on both sides, they parted.
eng_Latn were all in arow and on one side only of a corridor
eng_Latn there'd be no problems to face, problems that have no solutions.
eng_Latn I should be very unhappy.
eng_Latn I know I shouldn't have done it
eng_Latn I'm rather glad you are.
eng_Latn the last new freak is for the pilgrims to go round that way to ask his blessing.
eng_Latn however, entirely to relieve you of it
eng_Latn dumped their other traps on the ground
eng_Latn she was becoming most familiar were recorded as present.
eng_Latn heaved herself up enough to lock her legs around his waist
eng_Latn I took from my pocket one last detail.
eng_Latn if n you don't fight off his power
eng_Latn I took a deep breath, willing myself into composure.
eng_Latn by adjusting the annual and diurnal motions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with all accidental turnings of the wind.
eng_Latn but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood.
eng_Latn realizing that he alone of all the town was lost, forever and forever.
eng_Latn but a new soul with unsuspected powers.
eng_Latn who had already risen to take her leave, and went out.
eng_Latn for the worst of all is death
eng_Latn in the being near to the woman he loved.
eng_Latn I send it to her by you.
eng_Latn I shall be sure to find employment
eng_Latn leading the way into her drawing room.
eng_Latn But if people enjoy it...
eng_Latn three fixed crystal walkie talkie sets with a range of not less than five miles
eng_Latn whereof I soon felt the unhappy effect
eng_Latn the gate firmly bolted behind him.
eng_Latn there stopped, awaiting instructions.
eng_Latn I must tell you that my seeing her and the answer I brought you back were by hearsay too
eng_Latn I mean, we have to at least try
eng_Latn I noticed then that the van was filthy'thick with dirt.
eng_Latn glaring at him through a haze of brilliant red.
eng_Latn I mean from the love you bear
eng_Latn then you may easily find me out.
eng_Latn uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable.
eng_Latn supposing you persevered in your obstinate fast, and died by that means
eng_Latn its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace.
eng_Latn wipes his mouth and looks at her.
eng_Latn he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to any one
eng_Latn Awh This stinky stuff is very slippery!
eng_Latn I want to do a hundred miles before sunup.
eng_Latn I suppose he would be about sixty five
eng_Latn I craned my neck sideways to read the lettering.
eng_Latn I just don't know if I feel like a darling .
eng_Latn time had only strengthened in her absence
eng_Latn for how handy a rhyme is to pass us safe over the awkward transition from death to life
eng_Latn no circles were closed against me.
eng_Latn for none of her family bothered about it.
eng_Latn I don't want to start over.
eng_Latn I hope he is enjoying his harp and golden crown
eng_Latn he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right
eng_Latn when first I set my eyes on you
eng_Latn because you can't understand him or his kind of love.
eng_Latn It's falling apart! I can t have goats ... or anyone else, trip-trapping over it so it collapses! Someone could do themselves an injury.
eng_Latn as the vision of waters upon the earth is different from the delirious vision of the water which cannot be had to cool the burning tongue.
eng_Latn if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his
eng_Latn it is your place to seek the assassin.
eng_Latn this time, the person entered the room.
eng_Latn I had never seen the squire so near at hand.
eng_Latn for the present he took the card and put it in his pocket
eng_Latn she didn't react to the added weight.
eng_Latn Bow-wowzer!
eng_Latn I should never be quite happy if I thought he was unhappy for the loss of me.
eng_Latn galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.
eng_Latn I did come Pug.
eng_Latn kissed, and parted with tears in their eyes.
eng_Latn then, all because of him, came the other gentleman and carried off my tail
eng_Latn I grew seriously disturbed in the conflict of rumour
eng_Latn I was relieved when her father arrived home.
eng_Latn clutching his wrist
eng_Latn she fancied she heard goat bells ringing in their passes
eng_Latn but perhaps she will allude to him of her own accord in the course of the recital
eng_Latn had already advised the young man of a temporary remedy.
eng_Latn he took heart after a few moments
eng_Latn he had made up his mind to it by this time.
eng_Latn Hmm Take a card. Any card!
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn Oh Woe! Oh woe!
eng_Latn however, prevailed so far, as to have a punishment inflicted on me, worse, in all human appearance, than death itself.
eng_Latn ....Me too.
eng_Latn lest he should escape over the wall of the yard.
eng_Latn I kissed the top of his head.
eng_Latn for, that you are one, and of those that profess knight errantry
eng_Latn rocked to and fro with sorrow.
eng_Latn I came out, a little defiantly
eng_Latn always a sprig of coriander and a fistful of green chilies for free.
eng_Latn but these were not exactly the reasons why, for instance, the whole surveying camp, from the youngest of the young men to their mature chief
eng_Latn only then will he be a brave leader.
eng_Latn he roared and looked about him positively like a lion.
eng_Latn but at the same time she wanted to laugh with a strange new joy.
eng_Latn that she would follow her advice
eng_Latn changes in heart rate and breathing patterns
eng_Latn after he had called you murderer to your face, and you did not dare to ask him a question all the way.
eng_Latn but not aloud, of course.
eng_Latn I remember this place!
eng_Latn but I went home with my faith shaken
eng_Latn at least to come and ask it of us and not take it by force from the shepherds.
eng_Latn they drew away as though they were frightened of catching something
eng_Latn he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with blood
eng_Latn he repeated with gloomy insistence.
eng_Latn but he mustn't catch it yet
eng_Latn turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony.
eng_Latn for I am all he has.
eng_Latn so they took him too.
eng_Latn I am perfectly capable of driving myself home!
eng_Latn I only wish you were all as happy as I am.
eng_Latn I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping.
eng_Latn apparently obstructed by something in front.
eng_Latn I had not eaten.
eng_Latn that was when he would struggle up from sleep
eng_Latn at last, to my wonder and confusion
eng_Latn he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and sullied.
eng_Latn the preacher himself giving way to his feelings
eng_Latn I'd been away from it too long.
eng_Latn I welcomed the opportunity.
eng_Latn I've arrived at the airport with an hour to go
eng_Latn with a proud look and insolent demeanor
eng_Latn so that you may be supposed to have gone out.
eng_Latn so that he can think the same thing or the opposite.
eng_Latn when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft
eng_Latn she ought to have been here a month ago
eng_Latn prevents our speaking to him on any subjects
eng_Latn then I gave a cry of exultation
eng_Latn I was still concentrating on the girl, trying to hear something.
eng_Latn Ooh Camouflage!
eng_Latn the boy evidently thinking that the other had suspicions of the snowball.
eng_Latn but the little they had been able to hide in the woods and bury in the ground.
eng_Latn I forgot it and left it there.
eng_Latn to be cuffed and buffeted through the world
eng_Latn in his short old summer overcoat, with his head bare and his soft, old, wide brimmed hat in his hand.
eng_Latn under it in the box I found your present
eng_Latn her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge.
eng_Latn I can then rely on the notes he has left concerning you
eng_Latn but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal
eng_Latn blotted it from human sight she hoped for ever.
eng_Latn I know I'm not as scrupulous as I should be these days.
eng_Latn bending over the handlebars to cut down the wind resistance, picking up speed until he was nearly flying along.
eng_Latn seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts
eng_Latn he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry
eng_Latn so of what she had said they only noticed, and repeated in a whisper
eng_Latn I stick out my hand and hail a taxi
eng_Latn couldn't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him the whole thing by yourself?
eng_Latn feared that if he were now to approach the gentlemen in waiting in that plight
eng_Latn by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.
eng_Latn shipwrecked in a very remote country
eng_Latn but I fear I am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt
eng_Latn Oh, you can t come from there at once. You re not bouncing. You re being bounced!
eng_Latn the pads of his palms bulged
eng_Latn although he seldom had leisure for paying her a visit
eng_Latn the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.
eng_Latn but the girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early
eng_Latn that is, every man of sane judgment because it is not to be found in miserable legal codes.
eng_Latn he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain's bidding.
eng_Latn he was likely to be in the sixth year
eng_Latn or some one coming along who hasseen him there.
eng_Latn though it was tactless of her to say so in front of him.
eng_Latn who has not treated me as the master of the house,
eng_Latn shook out the intestines onto the skin
eng_Latn for the service he rendered me is still fresh.
eng_Latn I got hold of a piece of paper and a pencil.
eng_Latn Not according to them.
eng_Latn I don't know what I am thinking about these last few days.
eng_Latn without answering, went on with his dinner.
eng_Latn glanced round at a chair which seemed to place itself under him
eng_Latn I heard the carriage come round to the front of the house.
eng_Latn but how degrading it all is.
eng_Latn no one now, issuing from the wood
eng_Latn Really?
eng_Latn How serene - a village green.
eng_Latn left her no energy to spare for the question
eng_Latn looked up gratefully to the speaker.
eng_Latn so that I've been unable to send you anything all this time.
eng_Latn to get shot down by my own party in mistake.
eng_Latn that so important an event as the signature of a marriage contract was going on
eng_Latn I'm glad of the holiness of breakfast.
eng_Latn Hold tight boys. We re sinking!
eng_Latn had eased his heart a little of its burden by the time the wild fowl were before them.
eng_Latn as I did also to her father
eng_Latn was already fumbling in his pocket for the door key
eng_Latn after having wandered for more than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her
eng_Latn he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer
eng_Latn he had all the requisites for a blackguard.
eng_Latn I have remained until now simply because of my devotion to you, and as for danger
eng_Latn I was there all the while she had no time to do it!
eng_Latn he woke up in a fright, calling for a blanket.
eng_Latn his face was like marble, and his heart was like bronze
eng_Latn Mice - would you like to help me make your favourite cake?
eng_Latn therefore they were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in other places.
eng_Latn Snark!
eng_Latn added a cup of instant coffee with a lot of cream and sugar
eng_Latn she asked for the truth
eng_Latn but the general once more laid his hand in a friendly manner on his shoulder
eng_Latn the boy evidently thinking that the other had suspicions of the snowball.
eng_Latn now he returned to the umbrellas.
eng_Latn but no one noticed him and no one met him.
eng_Latn clinking the handcuffs together.
eng_Latn that's how it is the whole level of husbandry has fallen.
eng_Latn See those swirls? They re galaxies. Stars so close together they look like clouds.
eng_Latn then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed it.
eng_Latn but then let it drop like before and sighed.
eng_Latn he generously returned.
eng_Latn only hanging is too good for a thief and a profiteer
eng_Latn I don't want to freak her out.
eng_Latn when my master proposed an expedient to the assembly
eng_Latn if she flirted with anyone else.
eng_Latn besides, he's a regular child, though he seems to be fairly educated.
eng_Latn invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day.
eng_Latn I am dreadfully afraid.
eng_Latn dragged her into the middle of the room
eng_Latn lovely boy though she must have been
eng_Latn I'm sure you'll be hearing from him.
eng_Latn but he is the last man whose word I would take.
eng_Latn He checked himself carefully.
eng_Latn an instant later the paddle was bitten in two.
eng_Latn but I thought others were fairly dull.
eng_Latn it will shrink to a tadpole.
eng_Latn but again there was no answer.
eng_Latn which was closed for it was midnight
eng_Latn shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.
eng_Latn Can you see what I see Dog?
eng_Latn so insidious is the repetition of any scene
eng_Latn to spend the night in an abandoned rick of dry bulrushes.
eng_Latn of course, one has to say thank you.
eng_Latn but his appearance manifested increasing uneasiness.
eng_Latn then an indistinct muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.
eng_Latn he had given orders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction.
eng_Latn Bookshop mice, shall we finish our bedtime story?
eng_Latn to you also.
eng_Latn This is a book...
eng_Latn especially when that little girl was her favorite child.
eng_Latn he made me promise several times never to speak of that letter to any one
eng_Latn the outward bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her.
eng_Latn It's more of a trip hazard really.
eng_Latn I've explained why I said that.
eng_Latn alone and free and doubtless ready to provide him with the compassion he needed
eng_Latn I kissed the dust at his feet in thought only
eng_Latn which he had brooded over in the solitude of his village, and had considered in every aspect.
eng_Latn when he met me, he knew I was no dog.
eng_Latn if you're interested.
eng_Latn if it catches hold of the skirt of your coat, you will be drawn in bodily.
eng_Latn in which she told her that she was about to be married.
eng_Latn let him know, I there waited his majesty's command.
eng_Latn he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and fand him.
eng_Latn you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme
eng_Latn with theprettiest little rosy face in the world.
eng_Latn I'm for knocking off and lighting out.
eng_Latn it capsized and sank.
eng_Latn Welcome to the first puzzle, boys. There are five difference between you and your doggy doubles. Can you spot them all?
eng_Latn we must put mustard poultices, as hot as they can be made, on his feet and legs.
eng_Latn let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.
eng_Latn if he chose to ignore them, as he must to keep his position here.
eng_Latn who was praying by the side of the corpse
eng_Latn It looks very...nice Pug. But is it exciting? Today I am in the mood for close shaves and narrow escapes... daring deeds and pulse pounding chases!
eng_Latn I struck through the woods and made for the swamp.
eng_Latn I like a healthy breeze round my privates, thanks.
eng_Latn though not all of them expected to succeed as quickly as that.
eng_Latn till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.
eng_Latn and with that he drove on andleft the fellow standing there in the road like a bump on a log!
eng_Latn this is the boy from the workhouse that I told you of.
eng_Latn Is it me or is it getting hot in here?
eng_Latn I've long been yearning to see you
eng_Latn with drinking two drops of it thou wilt certainly be restored.
eng_Latn restrained his inclination for some plate of an old pattern which was shown to him
eng_Latn I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it.
eng_Latn but really the act of marrying this wife was a set off against the obligation.
eng_Latn I spoke as a mother.
eng_Latn like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness.
eng_Latn preceded by two barefoot orderlies
eng_Latn but I retired, confiding in her energy for a resting place against my return.
eng_Latn I was the one she said yes to.
eng_Latn even though the office was dark.
eng_Latn had been allotted a free first class railway pass for life.
eng_Latn the good things he had eaten or would like to eat.
eng_Latn an equal quickness to imagine more than the fact.
eng_Latn but as a man now fully devoted to him
eng_Latn the way you trapped that last one with the tea strainer
eng_Latn That s strange. They re not here, but there is a pile of paper.
eng_Latn two tables, with a cabinet to put my things in.
eng_Latn it seeks to prove inward joy by outward beauty
eng_Latn I gaze at him, wide eyed.
eng_Latn but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him
eng_Latn the high shining boots with enormous spurs
eng_Latn a cargador would fly out head first and hands abroad, to sprawl under the forelegs of the silver grey mare, who only pricked forward her sharp little ears.
eng_Latn once more flying
eng_Latn secure in the faith that his counsel may beable to extract him safely from this
eng_Latn the shrinking room which was so eminently distasteful to him
eng_Latn he carried nothing but his revery, however.
eng_Latn I walked round the yard, and through a wicket, to another door
eng_Latn they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive.
eng_Latn she was in that room in the west wing.
eng_Latn who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner.
eng_Latn was standing, gray whiskered and red faced,outside the gate of his garden
eng_Latn flung it at the castle
eng_Latn I sat down and waited
eng_Latn she thanked him with an inclination of the head, and began smelling her bouquet.
eng_Latn sometimes hitting the woof slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly
eng_Latn instantly changing the mood in the kitchen.
eng_Latn a person was sent to me by the king's order, attended by a flapper.
eng_Latn possibly a fox.
eng_Latn look at my brothers.
eng_Latn Aah Ancient Egyptian mummies.
eng_Latn Hang on, Pug!
eng_Latn I've two words to say to you, something pleasant, very pleasant.
eng_Latn but I am sure he is very uncomfortable.
eng_Latn so, instead of responding to this open hearted salutation in a kindred spirit
eng_Latn wearing a jacket and tie.
eng_Latn when I have the misfortune to meet with a mad dog
eng_Latn that the writer of the sonnet was in fact who he said he was
eng_Latn I need you to sit very still. I'm going to draw your picture.
eng_Latn as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.
eng_Latn I can't look up.
eng_Latn as well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honour to be his counsellors.
eng_Latn conversed and thought only of matters closely and manifestly connected with their work.
eng_Latn in the afternoon, I was busy getting up linen in the kitchen.
eng_Latn to practice calisthenics orrun and leap as they chose.
eng_Latn And so King Arthur s round table became the stuff of legend and brought much needed peace and harmony to the magical castle of Camelot.
eng_Latn in which, without assigning any reason, he begged him to go to the opera
eng_Latn not a dayover seventy nine years old
eng_Latn He s all of them at once!
eng_Latn the waitress, without looking, reached behind her and shut it off.
eng_Latn make one more attempt try me once more!
eng_Latn except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned.
eng_Latn she cried, gaily, jumping up and running to my side.
eng_Latn I love you, and I don't care for anything,
eng_Latn that was all he could remember.
eng_Latn when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand.
eng_Latn she has never in her life concentrated on anything more difficult than ice cream soda water.
eng_Latn opened a small door, near which they stood
eng_Latn so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies
eng_Latn I just have to do what I'm told.
eng_Latn ready to help and cheer all.
eng_Latn it was simply a matter of disgust.
eng_Latn our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.
eng_Latn I've heard them all suggested.
eng_Latn WELL, I catched my breath and most fainted.
eng_Latn then I've found him and I want to go to bed with him.
eng_Latn there was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke.
eng_Latn to his jaundiced eye, never seeming to get on withher dressing.
eng_Latn I've got a fellow coming to see me early to morrow.
eng_Latn but the atmosphere between us isn't remotely awkward any more.
eng_Latn I have an association with the name'and with the face.
eng_Latn it was this same boy that
eng_Latn had not come to see her for four years
eng_Latn I walked down street a ways and stopped.
eng_Latn which took up ten good minutes more.
eng_Latn she wanted to come and see you before
eng_Latn to do as you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
eng_Latn that therefore they need not try it again.
eng_Latn advancing towards the back staircase
eng_Latn but suddenly he didn't seem to have any insides at all.
eng_Latn after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks
eng_Latn put her at a disadvantage.
eng_Latn I remember that I dared not disbelieve it then
eng_Latn There s not much to being a pirate,is there Dog?
eng_Latn I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a visit here.
eng_Latn fear pricked her again.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer. It's perfect!
eng_Latn I wonder if Granny Pug is up there too?
eng_Latn then warmly loving and attentive toward her all through the party.
eng_Latn every thing I've got in the world.
eng_Latn had no more room
eng_Latn don't touch me don't!
eng_Latn Where will we find a dragon, Dog?
eng_Latn then, leaning against the writing table, he stayed until the evening, buried in a sorrowful reverie.
eng_Latn I have brought him to this
eng_Latn telling how as well as why she came to behere, also why she had not come before.
eng_Latn It's a game of join the dots as bigas the sky!
eng_Latn if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them
eng_Latn I returned to my own room with my head in a whirl.
eng_Latn it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor.
eng_Latn that he looked upon us as a sort of animals, to whose share, by what accident he could not conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen
eng_Latn I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head.
eng_Latn we can go and get all your things then, too
eng_Latn but I didn't go up to her, as though I disdained her acquaintance.
eng_Latn an affair for the police!
eng_Latn were spread out through a web of purple crosses.
eng_Latn I'm nervous enough to scream.
eng_Latn he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night
eng_Latn with such a haughty and dignified accent
eng_Latn two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet
eng_Latn more of them than I liked.
eng_Latn Until we read her next book anyway.
eng_Latn Hoorah!
eng_Latn however, he moved off to open the door
eng_Latn sat down on the trail.
eng_Latn And that s magic!
eng_Latn he was not diminutive
eng_Latn who soon disappeared at the corner of the street.
eng_Latn reads law and all stuff like that.
eng_Latn so it will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time.
eng_Latn I felt a moment of unease.
eng_Latn joined in the plot against me.
eng_Latn if not, to defend him to the limit of the law.
eng_Latn but as soon as he has done it, that action performed at a certain moment in time
eng_Latn courageously resumed her march, but the poor little desperatecreature could not refrain from
eng_Latn I want you to brew them carefully
eng_Latn everybody in both families thought it would be better to get married soon.
eng_Latn because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.
eng_Latn not have to lie still until one spot was sweat saturated.
eng_Latn The longest beard. The heaviest turnip.
eng_Latn there's a better move than that.
eng_Latn he was unable or unwilling to tell me.
eng_Latn she came to the rescue, armed with a coffeepot.
eng_Latn I'm glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on.
eng_Latn tosses her long blond hair back
eng_Latn because their pretensions to gentility were based on wealth, not breeding.
eng_Latn had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius
eng_Latn after their manner, as we shall describe in its proper place
eng_Latn breathe with the voice of the head deacon.
eng_Latn for the first time, unaccountably ashamed of the number of his servants and of the splendour of his table.
eng_Latn as though sure this couldn't work.
eng_Latn in the first case, I shall leave directly
eng_Latn All contestants get ready for the gold cup race!
eng_Latn I don't know yet who it is wants this place.
eng_Latn but he had never done this to any woman
eng_Latn which was his only chance to speak to her
eng_Latn I have no doubt.
eng_Latn as one unaccustomed to speaking
eng_Latn I'm going to put this snail outside where he ll be happier.
eng_Latn but he mustn't catch it yet
eng_Latn a red shawl draped over one shoulder
eng_Latn being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her father's house.
eng_Latn when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death.
eng_Latn Do come again. But not for a while.
eng_Latn I was afraid this would happen.
eng_Latn Sneeze, please.
eng_Latn a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy
eng_Latn he was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous.
eng_Latn who had carried off the prize of his virginity
eng_Latn To the wheelie-ladder, Pug!
eng_Latn here at that time by ladrones and matreros, thieves and murderers from the whole province.
eng_Latn though he was a poor man himself
eng_Latn but in the distance was still the same misty darkness.
eng_Latn Can we have a clue about what to do Granny Pug?
eng_Latn it was like she wasn't even human!
eng_Latn but fell back with a whimper of pain.
eng_Latn there were even a few girls in her classes who were reasonably nice.
eng_Latn to scratch his back with a long handled back scratcher
eng_Latn I summoned strength to ask what had caused this calamity.
eng_Latn I regret your suffering more than you realize.
eng_Latn Enter Dog and Pug...
eng_Latn yet for ever and for ever, to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him
eng_Latn And I suppose you have a brother called We are going to eat you?
eng_Latn he saw only moonlight and shadows.
eng_Latn then relaxed his hold on her and laid his head back against the chair
eng_Latn I established a second barrier around the hole.
eng_Latn I banged it a good while with one of my sculls
eng_Latn the affair is serious and unavoidable.
eng_Latn shaded the candle light with his hand
eng_Latn set to work at the petition
eng_Latn but you're safe, and that's what matters.
eng_Latn was leaning against the after rail
eng_Latn but his face was beardless
eng_Latn our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.
eng_Latn he addressing me by some elegant term that I don't care to repeat.
eng_Latn sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness
eng_Latn whoever it might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair'?
eng_Latn thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked in the town.
eng_Latn I made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate.
eng_Latn I don t think socks are the problem Pug. I believe I have a cold. Oooh
eng_Latn hen the rest followed
eng_Latn convinced that they could pass fairly and impartially on thefacts presented to them.
eng_Latn I think darling is better.
eng_Latn It is very heavy Dog. But when I'm bored I can make it into a crane.
eng_Latn Look at her go!
eng_Latn I came down again.
eng_Latn on these papers were written all the words of their language, in their several moods, tenses, and declensions
eng_Latn it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory.
eng_Latn a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school.
eng_Latn with his knife slightly split the end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat
eng_Latn had burned the dimming piles of nostalgic waste that life had accumulated in her heart
eng_Latn I assure you the general actually asked me to put you through your paces, and examine you.
eng_Latn they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.
eng_Latn his own voice, in his ears, was as dull and wearisome as everything else.
eng_Latn but no arms, except my hanger
eng_Latn you'd think we were all going to be attacked any second.
eng_Latn I called in my dream to the lodge keeper
eng_Latn where we had a very comfortable dinner, and passed the day with great satisfaction.
eng_Latn I could not tell if she loved him.
eng_Latn I don't care.
eng_Latn which had hitherto been a mystery
eng_Latn with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire
eng_Latn Yip! W-what kind of big friendlyanimal makes a noise like that?
eng_Latn who in a careless moment might peck out her eyes
eng_Latn her needle in her right
eng_Latn if we just ignore it
eng_Latn the sum of money which he, through a sense of delicacy
eng_Latn besides, they advised me not to come that they did not need me.
eng_Latn then sharp and short and dry
eng_Latn the sight of themselves from which no flame of life will ever leap!
eng_Latn Sortof. I ve been practising in my basement in- between learning to surf.
eng_Latn I needn't tell you to be secret.
eng_Latn I had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner
eng_Latn my fault! shameful, unpardonable!
eng_Latn I even decided I must have lost weight, because they didn't feel too bad.
eng_Latn each possessed of the anlage of movement.
eng_Latn they will come!
eng_Latn but I do know that she does not behave this way to hurt you.
eng_Latn A-and it doesn t like us very much!
eng_Latn but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four penny piece,
eng_Latn but with much more advantage to the captain
eng_Latn when they had regained the passage.
eng_Latn I've always been very good at repressing unpleasant things
eng_Latn he warned me after fifteen minutes of silence.
eng_Latn but in order to show that he took her levity with the toad in good part
eng_Latn its head lowered, its tail coiled down and over its privates.
eng_Latn when earthquakes caused the beach to gape.
eng_Latn i pulling it out
eng_Latn they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.
eng_Latn still no answer.
eng_Latn Horrible hairy spider, I'm coming down!
eng_Latn but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day.
eng_Latn for heaven's sake, don't let us indulge in recriminations!
eng_Latn I'm in trouble now.
eng_Latn he has three unlimited credits
eng_Latn his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury.
eng_Latn with that noble girl, thus pursuing paternal vengeance
eng_Latn I shall have to take the pupils into the hills, as usual, and see them settled there.
eng_Latn I have a reason a good one.
eng_Latn that she does not think much about it.
eng_Latn rose at his usual easy hour the next morning
eng_Latn I always make a note in my diary of all the exciting things we ve read about in the shop.
eng_Latn with the words fell forward and lay face down on the table, his head buried in his arms.
eng_Latn but if you find
eng_Latn I set up my sail
eng_Latn when I went near him he made off into the thickest part of the forest.
eng_Latn fancying himself the most valorous knight errant of the age in the world because of his late victory.
eng_Latn that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition
eng_Latn was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door.
eng_Latn turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony.
eng_Latn I send it over to print, stroll over to the printer and whisk it out before anyone else can see what it is.
eng_Latn that's the foolishest thing you could do.
eng_Latn awaited one kind word of consolation.
eng_Latn with it smote such a blow on the carrier's head that he stretched him on the ground
eng_Latn There was a tree. A tree so old it couldn t remember how old it was. And it sat on a hill.
eng_Latn they lifted the bench and the old man toppled over amid roars of laughter.
eng_Latn my own father was a sublieutenant in the army.
eng_Latn consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary
eng_Latn unfolded it, and read it
eng_Latn then open them again.
eng_Latn because he was less likely to be blown off course.
eng_Latn You can draw Dog and me any way you like.
eng_Latn I got up late.
eng_Latn but he was awakened twice or thrice during the night, as by some fixed idea.
eng_Latn I think I left it at work.
eng_Latn if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
eng_Latn he dabbed on cologne and waxed the ends of his white mustache
eng_Latn he would not be able to get back before evening.
eng_Latn I merely followed him round
eng_Latn her bedazzled sweetheart must have lost his mind.
eng_Latn but and always will be, pseudo healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths.
eng_Latn he was quite beside her, some twenty feet from the shore
eng_Latn I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.
eng_Latn I never rode in one before.
eng_Latn I don't know nothing but laundrying.
eng_Latn still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.
eng_Latn I was all over welts.
eng_Latn Aye - mutiny. What s mutiny?
eng_Latn so that the clock ticking on the mantelpiece beat like a hammer.
eng_Latn however, I refused, with expressions of the highest acknowledgment.
eng_Latn to see if all the edges were perfect
eng_Latn I don't believe you!
eng_Latn I'll have you transferred to another cell where
eng_Latn I then absolutely concluded, that all these appearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic.
eng_Latn I ain't seen him since he was little.
eng_Latn so that thou repent not of what thou hast done
eng_Latn for us only the cuffs and lamp whacks
eng_Latn it took time and effort for them to grow accustomed to its obsessive toom toom.
eng_Latn but a thin shine of perspiration had broken out on the back of her neck.
eng_Latn I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!
eng_Latn over there on the north side of the gulf.
eng_Latn I think I have served you faithfully.
eng_Latn the black serpent foundered.
eng_Latn gasped, and then screamed.
eng_Latn she deserved it she was a very good woman.
eng_Latn that my government believes the report was not a true representation
eng_Latn a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man
eng_Latn always appeared to him the iniquity ofjustice, and the crime of the law.
eng_Latn something they ate at dinner
eng_Latn touching it with his finger.
eng_Latn I would stab the man but the woman told me that if any misfortune happened to her betrothed she would kill herself
eng_Latn cast her eyes slowly round the room.
eng_Latn pointing to heaven with solemnity.
eng_Latn when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement.
eng_Latn but I was very firm.
eng_Latn no one of whom had troubled to communicate with him in any way
eng_Latn are that thou dost possess a wife that is worthy to be the pattern and crown of all good wives.
eng_Latn weighed on his heart and poisoned
eng_Latn he bred glow worms to serve his purpose.
eng_Latn still compact and in close ranks, mounting ata full trot
eng_Latn I am not going in this time with any iridescent ideas.
eng_Latn begging me to attend the opera.
eng_Latn without another word or waiting for a reply he made off home.
eng_Latn I haven't the faintest idea whether he would make good ornot.
eng_Latn he gulped it down, feeling as though he had never breathed properly before
eng_Latn ...it doesn t say. I haven t finished writing what happened yet!!!!!
eng_Latn but he nerved himself to it and entered.
eng_Latn then, with one hand dropping his light low over the sea
eng_Latn I knew it, I could read it 'SUCCESS!
eng_Latn it had been such an immense piece of luck for him at his age to get appointed on the staff of a big thing like that.
eng_Latn I can relive adventures and see old friends, like Brrr.
eng_Latn raised their heads to look at me, and then went on with their work.
eng_Latn I stayed but two months with my wife and family.
eng_Latn for I am naturally a poor little
eng_Latn a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him.
eng_Latn paused to scrutinize it.
eng_Latn you only told us
eng_Latn gave his bow into his feeble hands
eng_Latn but it was so unbearably hot that I got no further than the forest.
eng_Latn if you've nothing to eat,
eng_Latn I'm afraid there is nothing to find out.
eng_Latn see if you can manage to tell me the truth.
eng_Latn stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets
eng_Latn there was every reason to make him assiduous.
eng_Latn Merlin? Doh Where has that magician gotto now?MERLIN!!!
eng_Latn you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end.
eng_Latn I think everyone enjoyed themselves good and hearty, and that's the main thing
eng_Latn lost his mind
eng_Latn its nurse, and her maid
eng_Latn it had certainly never occurred to him that it might be produced on the stage.
eng_Latn but maybe there's a place for a preacher.
eng_Latn in order to distinguish myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of _Yahoos_
eng_Latn except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves.
eng_Latn I hope to heaven that he has gone
eng_Latn The pictures of cheese have completely vanished!
eng_Latn to take care of me, and direct what I should do.
eng_Latn I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study
eng_Latn the flat on the second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though for his benefit, they had just left.
eng_Latn was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly
eng_Latn how much it has cost me to say the first word.
eng_Latn how I hate them
eng_Latn Where is that Little Red RidingHood? Ooh. I love pizza.
eng_Latn I love books that start with a...
eng_Latn spoke with the outward assumption that no obstacle stood in the way of his agreement with her plan.
eng_Latn but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth.
eng_Latn This is a history book about howpeople lived in the past. And it is called...
eng_Latn letting me put on my best suit of clothes, which were as good as new
eng_Latn I feel cross, but not very , that frivolous young man, would you believe it, seems to have taken it into his head to fall in love with me.
eng_Latn until he came out with another chair and joined me.
eng_Latn Clown feet stay on the ground.
eng_Latn It's okay, Dog. All we have to do is look in the diary and find out how we got to safety.
eng_Latn for your light will not die even when you are dead.
eng_Latn that he meant to take also a very good ass he had
eng_Latn Fit for a queen Pug.
eng_Latn which we intended to take up our position and begin the action
eng_Latn the woman turned her head
eng_Latn I realized now that I'd long ago given up any aspirations of shining at anything.
eng_Latn he raised his arms to embrace his daughter good night.
eng_Latn he all but fell over on to the chest
eng_Latn Ready, Pug?
eng_Latn I was caught in the act
eng_Latn I can read character at a glance
eng_Latn I continued to stare numbly at the side of her face.
eng_Latn to three other travellers who had by chance come to the inn
eng_Latn Oh, bobbins! One is most disappointed! You have not found that darling Cheshire Cat.
eng_Latn that was the cause of his delay in obeying my master's summons.
eng_Latn how much I may feel on my own account.
eng_Latn if ever that solitary superlative existed
eng_Latn Umb…How curious.
eng_Latn he is only a parson among parishioners whose lives he has to try and make better.
eng_Latn Now we ll never forget what we did yesterday!
eng_Latn bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his head
eng_Latn not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances.
eng_Latn being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope
eng_Latn tripping down a couple of steps
eng_Latn Not the climbing frame! I only just built it!
eng_Latn that he could have any legitimate interest in her.
eng_Latn where she left me.
eng_Latn So many new smells to enjoy.
eng_Latn total, $31. 85.
eng_Latn please don't apologize.
eng_Latn the best of them all.
eng_Latn without disturbing your s sensitive conscience.
eng_Latn because they were all hired on a temporary and occasional basis.
eng_Latn I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.
eng_Latn And for my next trick
eng_Latn I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in blood.
eng_Latn through the giant oak front doors
eng_Latn I shook my head and turned away.
eng_Latn I don't have that much imagination.
eng_Latn as though it were only his due.
eng_Latn that the dead cannot be numbered
eng_Latn I didn't realize someone was holding my hand until whoever it was squeezed it lightly.
eng_Latn as they were all attention, wondering
eng_Latn I tiptoed down the path
eng_Latn carrying her off without giving her time to resist
eng_Latn continued to turn it.
eng_Latn at least long enough for me to have the baby andplace myself right before my people and every one else that knowsme.
eng_Latn I didn't bother to swipe it away
eng_Latn he stood a good chance of being torn to pieces.
eng_Latn quizzically at first
eng_Latn he seated himself in the boat and began rowing towards the harbour's mouth.
eng_Latn I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
eng_Latn glaring at him through a haze of brilliant red.
eng_Latn they had sent out a TV reporter to do a story on her.
eng_Latn his parents had to put him in a mental institution
eng_Latn she stood on the threshold, and went to fetch her sunshade and opened it.
eng_Latn I wondered how the hell they could all have got there until
eng_Latn Why do snails have shells Dog?
eng_Latn I will bring him up.
eng_Latn because it may very well be the case.
eng_Latn on such subjects wrong teaching is as fatal as no teaching.
eng_Latn then I couldn't just tell her then notthat day, anyhow.
eng_Latn but he's such a low fellow, that I wished he had been on the wrong side.
eng_Latn proceeded not to weep, not to mourn, but mechanically to take off the wedding dress
eng_Latn I hope that being in love doesn't make every one ten years younger.
eng_Latn OK, I say with a little shrug.
eng_Latn until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes.
eng_Latn who had been somewhat used to the sea.
eng_Latn I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!
eng_Latn with almost a quaking sense of adventure.
eng_Latn I opened the book at random, as she proposed
eng_Latn held the receiver a foot away from his ear
eng_Latn dat had ketched a wood flat, en his marster didn' know it
eng_Latn Uh... Dog. I'm having a bit of trouble here.
eng_Latn he'd never had much practice.
eng_Latn his wavy hair was standing on end
eng_Latn trying to amuse, describing my fellow passengers.
eng_Latn very small in her simple, white frock
eng_Latn that they never made up their minds to any important undertaking without consulting her.
eng_Latn but do let me enjoy the society of this delightful young man.
eng_Latn the price of wool began to creep up, then skyrocketed.
eng_Latn yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it
eng_Latn became a concrete and dramatic reality.
eng_Latn rising with great force, the coffin life buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.
eng_Latn making something of aconfession at the same time, and yet boasting of her deed.
eng_Latn anxiety and expectation expressed in all his movements.
eng_Latn I didn't realize I was crying until it was time to say the binding words.
eng_Latn that he wasready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything.
eng_Latn sat so long after it
eng_Latn to enter and twine itself about the weary heart of the land.
eng_Latn he gave a sigh which I took to indicate his relief.
eng_Latn I ordered the rest across the line, to drive the enemy away from their shelter behind a culvert.
eng_Latn the second was criticism.
eng_Latn return and tell me.
eng_Latn must toil incessantly for three or four weeks, three times as hard as usual, living on rye beer, onions,
eng_Latn then returned to stand behind him and watched him paint.
eng_Latn looking disconsolately over the top of it towards the parlour window
eng_Latn the power I had.
eng_Latn I saw you with someone last night.
eng_Latn or, without turning round,handing a pipe he had finished to
eng_Latn department which required the separate supervision of either an assistant forelady or man.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer. We can hide in these cupboards!
eng_Latn went about three miles into the country
eng_Latn the woman, who may not have been there.
eng_Latn but things seemed to have stopped.
eng_Latn found that it came to sixty three reals
eng_Latn I've tried putting soap under her finger nails,
eng_Latn silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready
eng_Latn because he had other things to think of.
eng_Latn then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty.
eng_Latn she had a remarkable ability for manual work
eng_Latn I'll be bound he is.
eng_Latn because I told my master, that his help would be sufficient
eng_Latn stairs which before this he had seen from the jail!
eng_Latn these sometimes tend to produce bodily fatigue
eng_Latn Is THIS the kind of place you d like have a holiday?
eng_Latn I've never heard anything so vital.
eng_Latn he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.
eng_Latn she could have nothing to explore or to suffer
eng_Latn but that gentleman being absent his secretary by his orders opened his letters
eng_Latn I come direct.
eng_Latn it is another privilege we exercise in our little moorland home
eng_Latn but found he had too much hair.
eng_Latn I'll be waiting to open the door.
eng_Latn from what they told me the day before yesterday
eng_Latn her majesty made me several visits during my sickness.
eng_Latn but she made no effort to retrieve it.
eng_Latn who had done me no wrong
eng_Latn I was giddy from staring down at the terrace.
eng_Latn I shut off the engine and got out.
eng_Latn thinking to attend one funeral would follow two
eng_Latn he's not a hero!
eng_Latn there came an awful longing to weep and cry
eng_Latn a flood of emotions surged up in him
eng_Latn but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!
eng_Latn it looks like folks have gone crazy about rebuilding.
eng_Latn which is all the more curious and all the more precious
eng_Latn it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment
eng_Latn turned towards the spot where
eng_Latn my precautions were taken.
eng_Latn but nothing else, she feared, would cure her.
eng_Latn but I hope it's really hurting him
eng_Latn very ungrateful, indeed, considering who and what she is.
eng_Latn It's alright for the bookshop mice.They re not afraid of spiders. They have a spider for a friend.
eng_Latn but life in that house proved stronger than her virtue.
eng_Latn now flourished thick with flowers.
eng_Latn but interpretations are illimitable, and in girls of sweet, ardent nature
eng_Latn I forgot how you liked her and I'm sorry for what I said.
eng_Latn wiping his mouth on his sleeve
eng_Latn he evidently needs support, I quite see that! .
eng_Latn their only care is to dispose of it.
eng_Latn as we said
eng_Latn we do not expect people to be deeply moved by what is not unusual.
eng_Latn I said it is a nice fake.
eng_Latn I think the whole essence of the concept is vitality, she says
eng_Latn youre my friend.
eng_Latn I had many enemies, and all because of the children.
eng_Latn he took all of his belongings with him in that boat.
eng_Latn He sounds like a very good actor.
eng_Latn you should just give him the book back, and make him know it.
eng_Latn immediately repaired to the usual walk on the terrace to see if there were any sign of the reed
eng_Latn that everybody was heartily sick of them.
eng_Latn went out in the middle of a solo and drove home.
eng_Latn drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.
eng_Latn staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes.
eng_Latn spread it out on a table
eng_Latn I felt stunned and shaken.
eng_Latn I want to go to the bathroom.
eng_Latn it was like a fresh slap in the face.
eng_Latn I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who was an innocent sufferer upon my account.
eng_Latn fell prostrate on the ground.
eng_Latn I've known you since you were a baby.
eng_Latn A.I. means Artificial Intelligence Pug. It's the thing inside robots that almost makes them think.
eng_Latn he was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.
eng_Latn except where a course of study is required.
eng_Latn for devoting myself to some one else.
eng_Latn but kindly act in due form and don't play with me!
eng_Latn how some men came along in a skiff
eng_Latn I found her sitting in her chair
eng_Latn you running away with the idea that
eng_Latn evasions until it turned into nothing but an illusion.
eng_Latn that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity.
eng_Latn his brows contracted to their utmost limits.
eng_Latn occupying, as it did, some twenty minutes in the telling
eng_Latn returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.
eng_Latn even after a six hour flight without sleep.
eng_Latn which was not very difficult to carry
eng_Latn I hope you find a chair.
eng_Latn his blue eyes very kind
eng_Latn Who is very good at baking.
eng_Latn cuffing him around the head with her outstretched wing as she went.
eng_Latn Pug can direct us instead.
eng_Latn I am ready to give up my whole life.
eng_Latn that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang.
eng_Latn slightly upwards, mollified and questioning.
eng_Latn I never heard her speak
eng_Latn the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a minute or two 'to bear him up
eng_Latn I only wish to say two or three words to your master
eng_Latn went out again along the continuous terrace toward the front door
eng_Latn And the arms... and the brain. Cardboard is very complicated stuff!
eng_Latn had associated her quite newly in carrying out his plan.
eng_Latn she is not likely to go visiting on such a day.
eng_Latn but because she will marry
eng_Latn I am so sorry to have kept you waiting
eng_Latn but as plays have become a salable commodity
eng_Latn brought it about that when we were now in mid sea
eng_Latn definite in space and absolutely attainable within a limited time, the other man appeared for an instant as a dreamy idealist of no importance.
eng_Latn straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face.
eng_Latn to my great joy
eng_Latn I just want to have sex!
eng_Latn I seen it all shut up and dusty
eng_Latn had not met those three menin the woods!
eng_Latn then reached for a telephone and spoke into it.
eng_Latn but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him,
eng_Latn I'll keep my costume a secret to the last minute, and you won't know anything about it.
eng_Latn her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window
eng_Latn a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife.
eng_Latn he shunned my eye.
eng_Latn though you should live more years than sarna.
eng_Latn It could be a minute or an hour orall night.
eng_Latn then he put his arms about her in large tolerance and stooped.
eng_Latn I'll go and tell him you will come directly.
eng_Latn thinking there might be something useful in there.
eng_Latn I was in the box room at the time
eng_Latn but I had the uncomfortable sense of things left unsaid.
eng_Latn hid myself behind a stone by the little brook
eng_Latn she entreated instead of answering my demand.
eng_Latn I ran out of his office and came straight here.
eng_Latn she remembered him from her unmarried days.
eng_Latn I couldn't succeed till everything she knew was out.
eng_Latn I hope you last longer than some of my other followers.
eng_Latn stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do or say
eng_Latn startling him with his first vivid notion of finely adjusted mechanism in the human frame.
eng_Latn who had said she would receive them there.
eng_Latn I felt an overwhelming compassion.
eng_Latn her mouth replied to one, and her glance replied to another.
eng_Latn I might help him the better in his great works.
eng_Latn I stepped forward again, and he stepped back.
eng_Latn who took it up, curious to know whose it was
eng_Latn I hoped the voyage had been good
eng_Latn that strangely enough by the one girl of this upper level
eng_Latn Now you can do what you really want to do - you can grow things!
eng_Latn And I can draw him back again. Whatdoes he look like?
eng_Latn the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment
eng_Latn with a chimney sweep driving the hearse advised by the regular driver
eng_Latn observing I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin
eng_Latn Don t you want to be quiet for the rest of the day Dog?
eng_Latn I'm jus' pain covered with skin.
eng_Latn It smells like... like..
eng_Latn I knows this place. X marks the spot!
eng_Latn he had already gone to his business.
eng_Latn but I hold him in a reverential respect.
eng_Latn We re here, Janice! You ll be outof that tree in no time. Hup!
eng_Latn very important, that I was keeping till I should be in bed.
eng_Latn we had the room to ourselves.
eng_Latn you've gone on till you've turned the poor wench's head.
eng_Latn take up this lad behind you.
eng_Latn I felt I had forfeited her sympathy by my refusal to go down.
eng_Latn they were all quiet until the lay sister left the room.
eng_Latn I saw the company was pleased with my behaviour
eng_Latn calling for help till I was almost hoarse.
eng_Latn we walked up and down, for a minute or two, in silence.
eng_Latn who the devil should know
eng_Latn And it seems we are not the onlyone. The sweetest little pug dog just ran that way.
eng_Latn or we're gonna get caught and wind up in somebody's trunk.
eng_Latn straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face.
eng_Latn I must try.
eng_Latn Backwards.
eng_Latn it is I who am deluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not thy master!
eng_Latn in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady.
eng_Latn for his madness is amusing
eng_Latn it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion.
eng_Latn Ahoy boys!
eng_Latn moved a few steps, and again stopped.
eng_Latn I wish to pass it on to my daughter when she is twenty five
eng_Latn but then they use their sitting room every night nearly until ten thirty or eleven.
eng_Latn I am in love with a charming woman, and she is in love with me
eng_Latn a pair of what looked like children's soccer shorts
eng_Latn I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy
eng_Latn This is a knight to remember!
eng_Latn was able to form a clear conception of the man.
eng_Latn I told him, that since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my way
eng_Latn but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote.
eng_Latn a burning sense of jealousy of the favorite agitated him now as strongly as it had done then.
eng_Latn looked closely at every detail of the plans
eng_Latn like a mark in invisible ink brought to the fire.
eng_Latn I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking me, I suppose.
eng_Latn bending, kissed her cheek.
eng_Latn a flea in his ear, as the saying is.
eng_Latn she was ready to give it every bad name in the world.
eng_Latn with a thud that made the whole room tremble.
eng_Latn to realize that he had signed his name with his last breath.
eng_Latn I don't know whether I can tell you about myself or not.
eng_Latn she had a remarkable ability for manual work
eng_Latn I can't agree even,' said he, that the government had that aim.
eng_Latn for all I know, that his father and his brothers finally got fed up and shipped him out of the country.
eng_Latn if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat
eng_Latn that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit
eng_Latn I rolled in my bed toward where he lay on the floor
eng_Latn I didn't understand until I heard that.
eng_Latn a person was well versed in affairs.
eng_Latn went into a little shop
eng_Latn And if the baddies are dragons?
eng_Latn I have never been out of my own land before.
eng_Latn twenty six battalions rode to meettwenty six battalions.
eng_Latn on view at that hour in his coffin
eng_Latn which will make a great noise, which will talk very loud, and which will bless you
eng_Latn till the bell rang.
eng_Latn which he had never used before.
eng_Latn I pledged them for ten roubles.
eng_Latn this being amunicipal regulation
eng_Latn after he has grown rich he will give him his soul
eng_Latn felt at the foreshadowing of success an almost boundless affection for his two helpers, for these two young people from over the sea.
eng_Latn Those cheeky Cheese-Chompers!
eng_Latn unwilling to let them see that they had been observed.
eng_Latn I blamed none of those who repulsed me.
eng_Latn I'd walked ten miles and I wasn't tired.
eng_Latn I must help him. I must.
eng_Latn the next morning early they had moved on to another lake.
eng_Latn caused him to suffer from a sense of having misused and demeaned her not a little.
eng_Latn I felt the difficulty of resuming the subject
eng_Latn I've had enough of it
eng_Latn or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.
eng_Latn when he spoke there was suave brutality in his voice.
eng_Latn Billy, before you bark, Dog wantsto tell you a something.
eng_Latn they even lighted candles and celebrated novenas.
eng_Latn he took all of his belongings with him in that boat.
eng_Latn To the wheely ladder Dog?
eng_Latn as early as you can for if you do not you will lose everything that you have won.
eng_Latn I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay.
eng_Latn WORK TIME!
eng_Latn encourage her to think of marriage and a home of her own.
eng_Latn I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.
eng_Latn I will notconsent to it.
eng_Latn but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed
eng_Latn certainly frightful, perhaps sanguinary
eng_Latn the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual position
eng_Latn saw this vast body descending almost to a parallel with me
eng_Latn I think you'll find it a real challenge.
eng_Latn yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.
eng_Latn anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt.
eng_Latn while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling
eng_Latn I'll go on the rim before I'd give that son of a bitch a dime.
eng_Latn auburn hair, and a thin, fresh
eng_Latn but that he had it and peace completeand secure.
eng_Latn I couldn't ever hate you.
eng_Latn such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way
eng_Latn which I hoped would do me good.
eng_Latn but there was no reason to waste one's time over him.
eng_Latn Here comes the sun Bella.
eng_Latn what commercial and social honors might not come to him?
eng_Latn but, be that as it may, he had not been long at his perch
eng_Latn it will bring bad luck.
eng_Latn soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey.
eng_Latn that's why he wanted to marry me!
eng_Latn you will only have to look at night
eng_Latn it was not a thing likely to have an end,with imaginations like theirs to furnish material.
eng_Latn I will pick you up at eight fifteen.
eng_Latn as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.
eng_Latn expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities.
eng_Latn she put back into the box and carried away.
eng_Latn I lay down in the old little bed in the stern of the boat
eng_Latn pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.
eng_Latn I don't understand.
eng_Latn neutralized the effects of the poison?
eng_Latn took up her knitting.
eng_Latn until the very moment when they climbed into the tumbrils.
eng_Latn she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants
eng_Latn but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden
eng_Latn the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves
eng_Latn none of them to know about the others and each to leave on a different road
eng_Latn I didn't mean any of what I said on the plane.
eng_Latn but no one discovered that she was blind.
eng_Latn his voice echoing in the dark passage.
eng_Latn he will bring his witnesses
eng_Latn but from the other spit the uppermost story of the palace was plainly visible.
eng_Latn a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife.
eng_Latn I was in the box room at the time
eng_Latn I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm
eng_Latn strong when you are sickly
eng_Latn he had attached such importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had taken place
eng_Latn feeling all the strength of her love for them.
eng_Latn I guess that's all.
eng_Latn no ties of friendship or humane consideration
eng_Latn I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history
eng_Latn the men among the trees
eng_Latn for if I anger him, the first he'll tear in pieces will be myself.
eng_Latn the evil for him who goes to look for it
eng_Latn I managed to turn the tables on him.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shop that could tell us.
eng_Latn I turned down the stereo and listened to the music in my head
eng_Latn I saw him this morning without pack saddle or harness of any sort
eng_Latn but easy to get over, and the scenery fine.
eng_Latn between you and me there was never anything but kindness.
eng_Latn A-a-and look at the bookshop mice.
eng_Latn I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer
eng_Latn Bow Wowser... they ve gone mouldy!
eng_Latn I opened it, and found a single sheet of note paper inside, with a few words written in an unfamiliar hand.
eng_Latn to make them cease to be so and descend to the level of the beasts.
eng_Latn a suit of pyjamas was 600 and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair.
eng_Latn soon you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help.
eng_Latn the servants reported that he had been absent from his house all night and had taken with him all the money he had
eng_Latn I was the first to pitch on you.
eng_Latn I suppose you'll communicate with the relatives.
eng_Latn his reputation being so well established
eng_Latn I shall try to perform them as faithfully as
eng_Latn I sat down in my seat in the front.
eng_Latn I love my father
eng_Latn I should like to make a chain of evidence such as twice two are four
eng_Latn but that the minimum rate paid by first class magazines was two cents a word.
eng_Latn I am almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel.
eng_Latn with the fifteen thousand already in your pocket
eng_Latn she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen this very thing.
eng_Latn as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow.
eng_Latn when papa was gone, she made me come to the window
eng_Latn were almost putout with weeping.
eng_Latn eyed it curiously.
eng_Latn or that he should even very heartily approve it
eng_Latn I pull a face at her behind her back as she leaves, and start putting on my mascara
eng_Latn whereupon she quitted her grasp, with the utmost reluctancy
eng_Latn with this booty I made a hasty retreat.
eng_Latn laid himself out to be polite and social.
eng_Latn I should be glad to have change of this five pound note.
eng_Latn I couldn't help hearing
eng_Latn a car will be waiting to take you out to the country.
eng_Latn that she put it back at once
eng_Latn as I look back on'tnow, it musta been pretty good.
eng_Latn the duke went for him.
eng_Latn which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right.
eng_Latn finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival.
eng_Latn dipped her beak briefly into his goblet of orange juice, then took off again
eng_Latn it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going.
eng_Latn the bit of money I'd put aside during the last year of war
eng_Latn spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such civilities from a _Yahoo_.
eng_Latn said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.
eng_Latn I don't care if you're a problem or not.
eng_Latn gallantly taking her way unvanquished.
eng_Latn the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill usage and violence
eng_Latn quietly though she sat, taking up her stocking again
eng_Latn said the count to the veiled woman
eng_Latn yet I have had the weakness
eng_Latn all hands were turned to
eng_Latn has engendered these lawless thoughts in thee
eng_Latn I am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm.
eng_Latn the treasure in the hold of her, by thunder!
eng_Latn preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable
eng_Latn I just love to coddle those darling leeches.
eng_Latn carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all.
eng_Latn maybe I was too late.
eng_Latn being uncommitted as yet
eng_Latn that afterwards he had not gone to her rescue
eng_Latn I've had the care of our own six horses.
eng_Latn (Breaths)Gah.
eng_Latn everybody was to be ordered to leave.
eng_Latn yet it is also beautiful and necessary.
eng_Latn for drawing his sword without another word he made a rush at the stand.
eng_Latn then she took him by the hand and drew him into the room.
eng_Latn not looking where she was going
eng_Latn but they have been that way always.
eng_Latn It was very good Lee and Bella. Wesaw all sorts of things we have never seen before.
eng_Latn smiling in spite of her sorrow.
eng_Latn ten days, and still he did not come.
eng_Latn I'll tell you one thing
eng_Latn but with its last strength the carp again plunged into the depths.
eng_Latn but the necessity irritated him
eng_Latn at last I gained the summit.
eng_Latn I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her monstrous breast.
eng_Latn certainly no respectable relations.
eng_Latn went straight to his bench and to work.
eng_Latn it wasn't something you ever really got used to.
eng_Latn wondered what his daughter looked like now.
eng_Latn so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone.
eng_Latn even in a landscape,
eng_Latn I would not have shown myself for all the world
eng_Latn if the stumbling forward ache were not alive
eng_Latn And now I have my book too.
eng_Latn You will have no more trouble from that hungry wolf.
eng_Latn so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way head foremost.
eng_Latn I stroked my fingers across the keys again.
eng_Latn thus I am certain that we could not have been overheard.
eng_Latn averting my eyes.
eng_Latn showing him her bare legs making him curiously certain that everything else was bare as well
eng_Latn I wish you would tell me what happened!
eng_Latn So you ll never forget them! Just a minute - can we read about what we did yesterday and where the feather came from????
eng_Latn particularly as the time was drawing near when it would be necessary for me to quit the cavern.
eng_Latn or else punish me so I'll be afraid to do her again
eng_Latn it is not only projected but arranged
eng_Latn decorated for the start of term feast.
eng_Latn then, loth to give up, he would branch off into feeling allusion to the dangers of his journey.
eng_Latn in those of fortune, in having many friends, and many and good children.
eng_Latn that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing
eng_Latn as I was sitting up late
eng_Latn till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea
eng_Latn the petition will certainly be granted.
eng_Latn he drew him aside and asked the reason of his having come there.
eng_Latn she had succeeded, she was satisfied.
eng_Latn on my account!
eng_Latn but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door
eng_Latn your grandfather says
eng_Latn the professor had promptly appeared to argue the matter out.
eng_Latn we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the life and health of your worship
eng_Latn Mr Barker, would you pass me yourwatch and chain please.
eng_Latn for that she should be frightened and run away.
eng_Latn I should imagine he must have been rather startled.
eng_Latn though he has wasted thousands on this enchantress already.
eng_Latn I do a lot of that nowadays, and this is the best place to do it in, as a rule.
eng_Latn was all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice
eng_Latn on condition that he never attempted to see your mother.
eng_Latn but he found it hard to keep himself going.
eng_Latn then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life, and my father's.
eng_Latn but do not mistake the horse for the rider.
eng_Latn for the corn could go, as long as something else remained.
eng_Latn had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.
eng_Latn suspended the use of red armbands
eng_Latn we have nothing more to do but make good our retreat
eng_Latn but I will forgive you.
eng_Latn be assured I will return the favor hereafter
eng_Latn his servants forgot it.
eng_Latn for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly
eng_Latn my little nurse ran to my relief
eng_Latn I have twenty visits to make and as many letters to write.
eng_Latn I get closer to him for a moment.
eng_Latn I'll have to be going now, though,
eng_Latn but he held her hand.
eng_Latn but to the west there was a ruby red glow.
eng_Latn I put it off to the last.
eng_Latn he saw her home
eng_Latn beg pardon of them on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them.
eng_Latn he had never known before
eng_Latn I was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon me
eng_Latn but for all the men who had the unfortunate privilege of seeing her, that was an eternal instant.
eng_Latn overwhelm her with joy
eng_Latn failed in releasing him from the count's iron grasp.
eng_Latn to which end let them be allowed the over seas term
eng_Latn seated passengers made room for the couple
eng_Latn We must be very quiet. There arecreatures here we wouldn t want to upset.
eng_Latn but merely did his utmost to gain his new master's favor.
eng_Latn took along with him his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him.
eng_Latn no longer keep her whole attention.
eng_Latn to day, thereremains only a doll.
eng_Latn there would be no satisfaction in killing a senseless animal.
eng_Latn They eat nothing but fried chicken,And you know that s not good for you.
eng_Latn through acrack in the door, which was directly opposite him.
eng_Latn for she was not bound to perform miracles
eng_Latn until the train turned a corner
eng_Latn he said with a disdain
eng_Latn but they were too weak
eng_Latn her bonnet askew
eng_Latn I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious man.
eng_Latn hanging his head in confusion
eng_Latn being indeed equipped for no other.
eng_Latn the odor in the house was sufficient proof
eng_Latn if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his
eng_Latn he attracted like a child to a candle
eng_Latn Dog, we have to do something tohelp her, because somethings are what we do.
eng_Latn resumed his former way of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations
eng_Latn while he walked in the manner of one entirely oblivious of the meaning or compliment of this waiting throng.
eng_Latn which he had adopted as his personal motto.
eng_Latn they have for their venial offences whatthey call the coulpe.
eng_Latn it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad.
eng_Latn humming a tune, reach for her comb and run it through her hair.
eng_Latn even if you disagree with the council's decision.
eng_Latn that he had come here to make his fortune.
eng_Latn I do not understand you
eng_Latn as if to show that they whose brows are honoured and adorned with such a crown are not to be assailed by anyone.
eng_Latn she called me back presently, and let me look too
eng_Latn I leaned back against her headboard and let her lie by my side
eng_Latn I wish it may prove true.
eng_Latn why would anyone want to wipe out his entire family?
eng_Latn what my own feeling is you already know
eng_Latn I've never had anything to sustain me
eng_Latn a good while ago she made me promise not to speak to her about it again.
eng_Latn Except that!
eng_Latn ill come in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play.
eng_Latn I hope you know that.
eng_Latn promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded.
eng_Latn there are a hundred francs in it, all that such a fortunate woman as I can call her own.
eng_Latn you've got rid of him for good and all.
eng_Latn the sun still low
eng_Latn familiar with its furnishings
eng_Latn he removed his bed
eng_Latn security which could sustain it.
eng_Latn she felt to her own want of spirituality.
eng_Latn better by taking it off and settling it again
eng_Latn I never went near it.
eng_Latn he was so weary of forever having to tilt his head up to see their faces.
eng_Latn must 'a been jealous, to tear such clothes!
eng_Latn for he always wanted a companion in his walks.
eng_Latn I love you more than anyone I've ever loved in my life.
eng_Latn got it a mile an' a half east of here an' drug it.
eng_Latn I shall never allow people to talk before me about wastefulness and profligacy, and so forth, in connexion with that life, any more.
eng_Latn then strode swiftly across to the table
eng_Latn but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear
eng_Latn all cooked and eaten that very evening.
eng_Latn the landlord in perplexity, and, in short
eng_Latn who began to amuse themselves at his expense, and so gratified her desire for revenge.
eng_Latn a man with no other principle than transient caprice
eng_Latn I want to go to the bathroom.
eng_Latn sent word to the livery stable to release the horse and buggy.
eng_Latn One of my jigsaw pieces has runaway and now you must solve three puzzles to find it.
eng_Latn who they say killed herself without having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him on whom the guilt of her misfortune lay.
eng_Latn so away they went, mad and yelling, and snatching down every clothes line they come to to do the hanging with.
eng_Latn jogging to keep up with their enormous strides.
eng_Latn so that it was palm up
eng_Latn tell me the name of the house where we are.
eng_Latn perhaps some faintness actually attacked her.
eng_Latn I have done nothing wrong.
eng_Latn so that people must put up with you whether you flatter them or not.
eng_Latn for he had finished his ale in a hurry
eng_Latn I hain't ever done you no harm.
eng_Latn I called in my dream to the lodge keeper
eng_Latn I'm repeating myself from the beginning.
eng_Latn his robes ripped
eng_Latn I saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek, and creep close to his bluff form as if it were her best support.
eng_Latn because I computed our taxes at about five or six millions a year
eng_Latn so they hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his servant.
eng_Latn I have nothing for you to do.
eng_Latn Well done everybody.
eng_Latn though they lay dying.
eng_Latn Dog, do you think I can teach the bookshop mice to dance?
eng_Latn but he made a mistake and turned to the right first.
eng_Latn raised it stubbornly
eng_Latn I gave him my heart
eng_Latn thou art indeed man's father in heaven
eng_Latn she backed toward the door and found herself against the wall.
eng_Latn I wondered if he was really going crazy.
eng_Latn but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes
eng_Latn the fact that theunintentional blow still had had anger in it angry dissatisfactionwith her really
eng_Latn who were always so interested in him and who always
eng_Latn warned that the night cometh when no man shall work.
eng_Latn sothat there existed a balance of age between husband and wife.
eng_Latn one who was compelled to work for her own living.
eng_Latn she crossed herself.
eng_Latn I'd made up my mine 'bout what I's agwyne to do.
eng_Latn I rang the bell and ordered away the tray.
eng_Latn there is still more due to the character of an honest man
eng_Latn but I'm not sure that the best way of saying it is by means of painting.
eng_Latn I spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned
eng_Latn might be known to none but himself
eng_Latn I've been part of that crazy universe before.
eng_Latn I suppose that it does not always run loose upon the moor.
eng_Latn I dare say she was very much pleased with you.
eng_Latn One ... two ... THREE!
eng_Latn he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise
eng_Latn not a line, not a word reached me.
eng_Latn Ohhh. Of course, I know the maze like the back of my hoof. But I suppose it is a bit hard to find the way here.
eng_Latn fenced in by the line between dark and light that stretched across the sidewalk in front of me.
eng_Latn Wait, Pug ... That ant hill means just one thing -
eng_Latn I wonder what my something special would be?
eng_Latn I'll be with you to morrow morning as early as possible with my report.
eng_Latn or else a glass of fresh water with a little moist sugar.
eng_Latn to compare great things with small
eng_Latn without a thought, seemingly,that her great moral and social need should modify his conduct inany way.
eng_Latn but that I might have done so
eng_Latn it was plain that she was tired of him
eng_Latn but realized that would not be the right thing to say.
eng_Latn I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision,
eng_Latn for it shall be attended to.
eng_Latn convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same.
eng_Latn ..I love books that ask exciting quest ions like..
eng_Latn but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles
eng_Latn I am weary.
eng_Latn it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences.
eng_Latn yeh don' have ter be pure blood ter do it.
eng_Latn was not inclined to share his son's opinion.
eng_Latn being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way.
eng_Latn then suddenly it dropped to the floor with a tinkle and broke in two.
eng_Latn pass as quickly as possible through the flower garden
eng_Latn I can't stand any more.
eng_Latn my old foe we meet on the battlefield once again
eng_Latn thought that I ought to read something 'improving
eng_Latn declared it was time to go.
eng_Latn besides you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces
eng_Latn I will do nothing for you.
eng_Latn make sure your ears are completely covered
eng_Latn he thought suddenly.
eng_Latn your grandfather says
eng_Latn but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over to give her the impression of
eng_Latn I put my arms round him and held him.
eng_Latn in spite of her very slight weight gain she began to suffer badly from too much fluid in the tissues of her body
eng_Latn I try thinking of a follow up line.
eng_Latn he looked at me astonished.
eng_Latn let us think,
eng_Latn if she didn't get there soon she was going to stain her dress.
eng_Latn he should be put in prison and hanged
eng_Latn dressed in full mourning
eng_Latn Who wants to play at being very quiet and not being seen?
eng_Latn in order to force him to raise his head a secondtime.
eng_Latn she came out of the bathroom with only a towel around her waist, her blond hair damp and curling.
eng_Latn but the girls would not leave their father, so the guests departed early
eng_Latn woe betide me and all my kindred!
eng_Latn they've been keeping him in the firehouse and not letting him bathe
eng_Latn evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way.
eng_Latn so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen.
eng_Latn though he had already been punished over this lesson.
eng_Latn I went out then and ran to play.
eng_Latn where there was only one old doctor.
eng_Latn the conversation drawing away happily from his health
eng_Latn Biscuits do grow on trees?
eng_Latn Does it say why I had a red feather behind my ear?
eng_Latn I shall have to teach her first how to study
eng_Latn the red eyed monster that had killed so many people that I'd stop counting their numbers.
eng_Latn there they were, like two babies, kissing and talking nonsense by the hour foolish palaver that we should be ashamed of.
eng_Latn for she was very weak.
eng_Latn I was expecting you! I was expecting you!
eng_Latn I can't rest till I get hold of him.
eng_Latn I've a lot of friends there
eng_Latn for once he didn't seem keen
eng_Latn whereas these gipsies were an ignorant people, not much better than savages.
eng_Latn that that brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me.
eng_Latn who had hidden so many things in this life that there was almost nothing left for them to say to each other.
eng_Latn when I got round to him, not he.
eng_Latn I should still just as much have to decide what I ought to do with her.
eng_Latn You get the party set up and wewill invite some of our friends along.
eng_Latn for my husband and I will give up our room to accommodate his worship.
eng_Latn Sorry about your wand, sir.
eng_Latn it was like a fresh slap in the face.
eng_Latn I stepped over the threshold.
eng_Latn as though she couldn't have sent it off herself!
eng_Latn he was grown so steady and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care
eng_Latn she saw the starting point of the thread of blood
eng_Latn so my conscience was at ease. I came forward.
eng_Latn I'm bought by the government for to day.
eng_Latn when he saw my drawing he just raised his eyebrows and walked on.
eng_Latn as I opened the parlour door
eng_Latn that between you and an ass there is not an atom of difference as far as braying goes
eng_Latn though to be sure when, after being a little while out of port
eng_Latn Our race!
eng_Latn without disturbing your s sensitive conscience.
eng_Latn I hope, sir, said he, you have no objection to make.
eng_Latn that frightens the bejesus out of them and one that makes them feel safe and secure.
eng_Latn but enough to silence the cook's faltering voice completely.
eng_Latn through the main sail.
eng_Latn I'll keep you here where you can be properly cared for.
eng_Latn he held out the coin to him
eng_Latn only looked down at her feet.
eng_Latn when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home,
eng_Latn we decided in favour of a nice little loaf of brown bread, which cost me threepence.
eng_Latn I would delay not to say a day, but four, for the sake of seeing it.
eng_Latn but that beautiful black hair
eng_Latn just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him
eng_Latn so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years
eng_Latn for it's time my education began.
eng_Latn as he saw it, that he was quite stirred by the dignity and richness of it.
eng_Latn how I had found it impossible to remain behind
eng_Latn his health would not allow the reception of any visitors.
eng_Latn except three or four, or maybe half a dozen.
eng_Latn I didn't even check if I got the right sex.
eng_Latn I had dreaded worse.
eng_Latn you may think over each move as long as you please
eng_Latn never had there been, or, at least, never it seemed to him, had there been so many hindrances and so many quarrels between him and the peasants as that year,
eng_Latn but error is worthy of veneration there, so thoroughly does it imply heroism.
eng_Latn much of the bright malicious joy of life had gone from her old eyes.
eng_Latn hastily closing the window shutter of the room into which it led
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! MY robot is alive too!
eng_Latn the air might keep them cool.
eng_Latn there was a stone veil between him and the firmament.
eng_Latn but this little piece o scratch that's here.
eng_Latn I'm just telling you what you already know.
eng_Latn while she was playing the clavichord.
eng_Latn I am well, and your father has influence around me.
eng_Latn I went to the safe house and found you.
eng_Latn dropped her riding habit, and stumbled over it.
eng_Latn I shall have to take the pupils into the hills, as usual, and see them settled there.
eng_Latn is good for health and spirits
eng_Latn on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon.
eng_Latn thank you for not using greater severity.
eng_Latn I hate to wait
eng_Latn who felt the perfidious manoeuvre of the young man
eng_Latn Well. No. I was just showing you what I will do when I catch one.
eng_Latn yet I gave you two hundred francs when I left three months ago
eng_Latn that's a thousand times worse than unkindness!
eng_Latn I don t like being on thisroundabout!
eng_Latn crossed the palisade on the north side
eng_Latn in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor
eng_Latn but I was young and stupid
eng_Latn I can't bear to think of bringing the news to him.
eng_Latn I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain's
eng_Latn put her in the new part
eng_Latn so that without hindrance she may run her course freely to attain the desired perfection
eng_Latn various other pursuits of a similar kind
eng_Latn by the side of the ladies, the curate and the barber.
eng_Latn it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet.
eng_Latn I had to remind myself of the need for caution.
eng_Latn let your old love speak for me!
eng_Latn she seems to have vanished without trace en route.
eng_Latn everybody knows that.
eng_Latn let each one mind his own business, and he will be doing enough.
eng_Latn I think she is awfully nice and pathetic.
eng_Latn I'd never seen him since then.
eng_Latn so firmly resolved to find him and not to give up doing so
eng_Latn And cream, lots of cream. Creamoverflowing. And cream.
eng_Latn so that, with the borzois on the leash belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.
eng_Latn they had taken him away from the land!
eng_Latn I saw you had one knight errant already.
eng_Latn as if he had imagined that her coming had anything to do with him.
eng_Latn who was less corpulent than his father
eng_Latn with one hand leaning on the back of the chair
eng_Latn glanced back through the pages, and again started his pencil.
eng_Latn Pug, I believe we have shrunk.
eng_Latn I tell you I can't bear it
eng_Latn I had no one to write to.
eng_Latn that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife
eng_Latn Will Earth dust do instead?
eng_Latn he could not prevent the man seeing him.
eng_Latn but I suppose you had no tools to aid you
eng_Latn suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, into a small room adjoining
eng_Latn which will seem quite ordinary to others
eng_Latn not bothering to shut the door.
eng_Latn a glimmering of light in chaos.
eng_Latn I snapped at him, told him to mind his own business.
eng_Latn was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.
eng_Latn the very summit of glory was reached.
eng_Latn it will cheer us up do now no ceremony!
eng_Latn I'm a hero?
eng_Latn this belief produced another dread.
eng_Latn in proof of which I may remark that while my family remained among the stanchest adherents of the exiled princes your father lost no time in joining the new government
eng_Latn the price would be nice, very nice indeed.
eng_Latn he wanted to touch that figure
eng_Latn but that is no name either for man or beast,
eng_Latn that he could not break away from her
eng_Latn I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry.
eng_Latn after the usual oratory of infants, to get me for a plaything.
eng_Latn I fell asleep in her arms, after that, and slept soundly.
eng_Latn (LAUGHING) You re tiny, not shiny. The managerwon t let you in!
eng_Latn that no misfortune was too great to bear
eng_Latn but, as I conceived, not altogether complete.
eng_Latn then swiftly dress and leave.
eng_Latn I am, but my bottom s a bit annoyed.
eng_Latn a spot where nothing could possibly run out went round above the ravine.
eng_Latn but make no treaty you understand me?
eng_Latn with a violent effort recovered himself, and skated off, laughing.
eng_Latn it rested there.
eng_Latn saying he had left me in a good service
eng_Latn I took a deep breath, willing myself into composure.
eng_Latn those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she did not let it out of her hands.
eng_Latn she failedeven to so much as think of them.
eng_Latn I have not the right.
eng_Latn I was part of the reason.
eng_Latn Oooh. I was hoping to be the first pug at The North Pole, but you ve beaten me to it.
eng_Latn go to the toilet, then return to the base of the ladder, pick up the log and climb again.
eng_Latn that had characterized him that even now he was, not a little impressed by the difference
eng_Latn he was made to take an oath and did so
eng_Latn I'm Big Digger. I can lift andcarry and go anywhere on my mighty wheels.
eng_Latn on a most extraordinary errand.
eng_Latn but for the moment I would rather not anticipate.
eng_Latn crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer.
eng_Latn he gave me a lift homeward.
eng_Latn but I can't.
eng_Latn I look at him, puzzled.
eng_Latn but maybe they won't be able to prove the killing on him, after all.
eng_Latn I jerked, hearing my name.
eng_Latn now he won't have those splendid provinces.
eng_Latn one of the enemy actually fell
eng_Latn with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round, moved across the room.
eng_Latn had made it dumb as well as blind.
eng_Latn I went into the wigwam
eng_Latn THE TRACTORS came over the roads and into the fields
eng_Latn was resolved not to stir a finger for him.
eng_Latn looking back, smelling the glad smell of burning.
eng_Latn I wondered if he was really going crazy.
eng_Latn I want you to imagine a forest. Amagical forest with a pool, a rainbow and unicorns!
eng_Latn seventy two thousand combatants on each side.
eng_Latn I don't want to hear it
eng_Latn tried to tell him without words that this wasn't true
eng_Latn with a smile which was not exactly tender, and certainly not merry.
eng_Latn she wished to bid him adieu
eng_Latn I didn't have to put my hand in my pocket for sixpence.
eng_Latn whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness.
eng_Latn I will not agree to take her without your full and willing consent.
eng_Latn told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came.
eng_Latn I wrote you so much about her.
eng_Latn unless maybe to stop the plug hole with my timber toe.
eng_Latn raised a shout
eng_Latn what the most skilful players have never discovered that is, a roulette
eng_Latn We can escape with those!
eng_Latn I hope that's okay by you
eng_Latn was he awake or was it but a dream
eng_Latn that he is incapable of bearing false witness against anybody.
eng_Latn for neither could row a boat or swim.
eng_Latn drawing his sword
eng_Latn he discovered as time went by.
eng_Latn now going up to the fire stood with his back towards it
eng_Latn everything must be left exactly as it is.
eng_Latn I would love to believe that.
eng_Latn at which I could not forbear laughing very heartily.
eng_Latn so this honest worthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning
eng_Latn he cast down upon the floor a paper
eng_Latn telling him beforehand and warning him to mind what he was about
eng_Latn I thought it better to wait and observe.
eng_Latn I done so, and then we all three started on again.
eng_Latn made him the more diligent
eng_Latn as a broken spar is suffered to float away disregarded after a naval victory.
eng_Latn now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.
eng_Latn but she could not give him the repose he had dreamed about
eng_Latn but sadder, without his gentleness.
eng_Latn And it was very, very big Dog!
eng_Latn kissed his hand.
eng_Latn who had left him only two hours before
eng_Latn I fix my gaze on it alone
eng_Latn I ve never seen foxes shopping in acity before.
eng_Latn thus shedding her company habits in a second, without thinking.
eng_Latn for he did not like any meddling with his affairs.
eng_Latn but he, too, had jet black hair.
eng_Latn I hope you enjoy a long, happy, boring life.
eng_Latn I have no doubt that he still has some comforting thoughts to the effect
eng_Latn predicked the whole
eng_Latn A fox who loves books?
eng_Latn I mean he made it seem like good weather.
eng_Latn that her fate must be decided now or never.
eng_Latn so that the whole thing turned out to be an illusion on her part.
eng_Latn They re stylish AND help me stand up straight.
eng_Latn who ran out in the same way in a high fever and fell into the well in the court yard
eng_Latn surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms.
eng_Latn he questioned, not turning his head.
eng_Latn All gone. But for some reason now I feel like pizza!
eng_Latn HIS wife was up when he came in.
eng_Latn but to all those who had need of him to protect and aid them in their misfortunes.
eng_Latn that's all I hear of his making.
eng_Latn when all possibilities would become probabilities
eng_Latn I hastened to comply with his friendly suggestion
eng_Latn four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight
eng_Latn hung low over the field of battle on the horizon.
eng_Latn in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house
eng_Latn I held the blackness of nonexistence at bay by inches.
eng_Latn not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox.
eng_Latn one morning, I remember, he came to me quite in despair.
eng_Latn Slap it on fast?!!
eng_Latn with both hands, and the golden thread remained unbroken.
eng_Latn I said then that it would be so,
eng_Latn we may be able to save her.
eng_Latn I had not one.
eng_Latn tell me now, dismissing anger and irritation
eng_Latn so that all the materials for building were at hand.
eng_Latn the day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself
eng_Latn Now look what you ve done, fumbly fingers!
eng_Latn he expected to see her appear at all the corners of the paths
eng_Latn the little woman walked quickly to her tent.
eng_Latn so dropping lovingly asleep.
eng_Latn I most certainly did not knock it over myself!
eng_Latn therefore, upon any unexpected signs of amendment, after they have pronounced their sentence, rather than be accused as false prophets
eng_Latn indispensable to hostesses.
eng_Latn should yet exult to the depths of his heart in this wild panorama
eng_Latn dropped her riding habit, and stumbled over it.
eng_Latn I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it.
eng_Latn I'm so sorry. My name is Enid Brighton. Would like to be in my gang and solve mysteries? We could call ourselves The Thrilling Three?
eng_Latn Watson?
eng_Latn I advanced forward
eng_Latn I'll keep you here where you can be properly cared for.
eng_Latn they have for their venial offences whatthey call the coulpe.
eng_Latn I was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career.
eng_Latn the steak, the french fries, the instant coffee, the strawberry rhubarb pie.
eng_Latn jerks at her skirt to make the old lady sit down on the brick wall.
eng_Latn going upon deck.
eng_Latn I hope he'll rot with some loathsome disease.
eng_Latn had not heard the train moving back, and had been crushed.
eng_Latn I got this here bearin' loose.
eng_Latn but 'rsula received him as a member of the family.
eng_Latn I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.
eng_Latn now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home
eng_Latn when he found he had finished
eng_Latn Ready? Steady? Go!
eng_Latn were really further evidence of hisgeneral earthly sin and guilt.
eng_Latn Dog, I think I saw a something!
eng_Latn in hiding in different places round about
eng_Latn not having to cook.
eng_Latn I tried to remember her face
eng_Latn he reclined and let the gently moving water flow around his neck.
eng_Latn the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.
eng_Latn she mutely, and with a sense of intense injury, retired to her private apartment.
eng_Latn in listening to it, I again wept.
eng_Latn they said that it had fallen down because the walls were too thin.
eng_Latn but in the mean time it was disagreeable to see his mother cry
eng_Latn being at length compelled to pause for breath
eng_Latn the master horse ordered a place for me to lodge in
eng_Latn a husky familiar voice answered from the black night.
eng_Latn who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole
eng_Latn I can recollect its chief incidents, as far as she had gone.
eng_Latn administered to a young girl!
eng_Latn but I hope,I shall be more fortunate with you, he said with a smile.
eng_Latn arrange with his servants not to take him back that day
eng_Latn I may have to circle the block, madame.
eng_Latn I have to break out of here.
eng_Latn at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind.
eng_Latn he was young, abstract, and therefore cruel
eng_Latn by to see him about something.
eng_Latn consoling herself, however, with the discovery, which her keen eye soon made
eng_Latn but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate.
eng_Latn I ll get my guitar!
eng_Latn but they have all snub noses,
eng_Latn so as to cause no one any inconvenience
eng_Latn wait till you've got a beard to your chin.
eng_Latn having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south latitude
eng_Latn but the rest of the fortune his parents had left him
eng_Latn now lay in agony
eng_Latn when I got round to him, not he.
eng_Latn I-Is that a Yeti?
eng_Latn which are so authentic and true, that
eng_Latn At number twenty nine they have different things to eat for a lovely balanced diet.
eng_Latn then open them again.
eng_Latn Have you written a story that could tell us what the Wumpus is please?
eng_Latn without reproaching him
eng_Latn tell me the name of the house where we are.
eng_Latn for though both were fine lads in their way
eng_Latn she hid her distress too well.
eng_Latn There s my book, look!
eng_Latn their country and ours were at peace.
eng_Latn genus hitherto unknown to science.
eng_Latn saw himself reflected in them as two tiny manikins of insignificant proportion.
eng_Latn everything depend on her daughter's inclination.
eng_Latn where no doubt he ordinarily had his station.
eng_Latn walked out onto the field.
eng_Latn that folks may know you've got them,
eng_Latn but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come to get her.
eng_Latn where he had better go and try to live.
eng_Latn I'll go crazy if I think about losing him now.
eng_Latn which he dared not even describe accurately here.
eng_Latn Me too. It's fun!Hup!
eng_Latn There have been many great artistswho have given us fresh way to see things, but one of the greatest was Pablo Picasso...
eng_Latn but she's certainly too old for you to marry.
eng_Latn How very elementary. I have been looking all over London when the solution to the puzzle was under my own nose.
eng_Latn I started out
eng_Latn I think you mean watch out Pug.
eng_Latn I cleared my throat.
eng_Latn but spluttered over every one, and boiled away, doing just what was required of it
eng_Latn leaning his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle
eng_Latn O.K. Diggers. This site is a mess.I want you to stack those pipes, move that sand and level this mud.
eng_Latn I suppose you couldn t point us in the direction of The North Pole?
eng_Latn Will you please hurry up! Some of us are waiting to start our race.
eng_Latn because the great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin now
eng_Latn for in truth what thou hast said about death in thy rustic phrase
eng_Latn I expostulated with him, but in vain
eng_Latn but I don't know anything about magic at all.
eng_Latn Dog! Dog! Look at me. I'm shining more floor than....
eng_Latn crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope
eng_Latn to give her the tongue depressor he had used to examine her throat.
eng_Latn with the breadth of a county between him and the next.
eng_Latn I rang to tell you that.
eng_Latn I am really very much obliged to you
eng_Latn that the emperor
eng_Latn little by little he was carried away by the flood of tenderness that filled his heart
eng_Latn I never was whipped in school.
eng_Latn he fell into a desperate confusion.
eng_Latn I have already told thee I will answer with all possible precision.
eng_Latn for time or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents.
eng_Latn looking over my shoulder like a criminal.
eng_Latn he had him bridled in an instant
eng_Latn And I will go this.
eng_Latn compared the questions he made with the answers I had given.
eng_Latn proceeding to cast out even articles of apparel that were imperative necessaries.
eng_Latn because, if you won't, I'll try violence.
eng_Latn blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.
eng_Latn Canis Major and Canis Minor.
eng_Latn I am so glad you are come
eng_Latn I loved the final touch the scream for help.
eng_Latn I shall expiate everything by this secret agony.
eng_Latn I have a hunch that s the kind of place a dragon might feel at home.
eng_Latn was no roof at all.
eng_Latn he gave her to understand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her.
eng_Latn for us only the cuffs and lamp whacks
eng_Latn if you are not the second person in the history
eng_Latn had it not been for an adverse destiny, that beloved monarch would this day have been among us.
eng_Latn they made a smoke mark for future guidance
eng_Latn I thought of your face, which from your infancy had the stamp of intelligence
eng_Latn she would never be happy until I had left it.
eng_Latn but scarcely cared enough to do it well.
eng_Latn I'll eat my head, and his too.
eng_Latn I'd guess from the rate they've been coming in more every day
eng_Latn almost her first resolution, to seek her for that purpose, in the pump room at noon.
eng_Latn you hold it tight like this and if it turns red
eng_Latn no more than a drop of water in the ocean
eng_Latn I'm going to be unladylike.
eng_Latn they had found when they walked down to the park yesterday.
eng_Latn Or perhaps we have a book in theshop that might help us?
eng_Latn ask about some socks.
eng_Latn until eventually I became so irritated that I decided to play the boor.
eng_Latn I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of nature.
eng_Latn I began putting things methodically in my suitcase.
eng_Latn Hmm There is a word... a magic word...that will do the trick. Sim Sala Bim!
eng_Latn so that I might notice in how much better form the patient was.
eng_Latn like a good brother, she answered demurely.
eng_Latn tears came as he spoke.
eng_Latn for the great gates, from one square into another, were but eighteen inches high, and seven inches wide.
eng_Latn found relief in the beetle
eng_Latn I never was whipped in school.
eng_Latn you and you, you and nobody else.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer!
eng_Latn but then they use their sitting room every night nearly until ten thirty or eleven.
eng_Latn I called the elf to the staffroom to collect some robes for cleaning.
eng_Latn I met her in the street this afternoon,
eng_Latn I put it in his mind myself,
eng_Latn shaded the candle light with his hand
eng_Latn I ve heard of haunted houses, but never haunted mouses!
eng_Latn pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news.
eng_Latn stroked his mustache
eng_Latn You ve been here for ten years.Don t you get lonely?
eng_Latn Oh no. A mice is missing! It must have got lost again
eng_Latn laid his head in a gas oven
eng_Latn when the fugitive husband was captured
eng_Latn they were for the most part thinking of them selves always and what they would do
eng_Latn I do want it.
eng_Latn he was clearly very pleased with himself this evening.
eng_Latn That sounds squeakily familiar.
eng_Latn then, overcoming his manifest repugnance
eng_Latn just at this moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside
eng_Latn packed in a traveling bag the things needed for a few days.
eng_Latn Our own sun!
eng_Latn no other case was discovered despite constant vigilance.
eng_Latn after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed
eng_Latn A diary is a book where you can write about things you did during the day.
eng_Latn as though we ourselves had left but yesterday
eng_Latn something like pity for those less lucky men who were not of his profession.
eng_Latn It's a story Pug and it's called The Three Marvellous Mice and the Amazing Picnic they had while Dog and Pug were reading!
eng_Latn My favourite blue pencil ismissing! And I pride myself on knowing where everything in my bookshop is.
eng_Latn so I don't feel guilty about giving you back this as well.
eng_Latn my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair.
eng_Latn making no movement but to possess himself of my hand.
eng_Latn You re not Holmes.
eng_Latn staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.
eng_Latn of condoling with you on the calamity that has brought you among us.
eng_Latn turned to walk to the house.
eng_Latn though changed in hue, it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk.
eng_Latn presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was insearch of.
eng_Latn he made her describe the whole house
eng_Latn after which he went to my master
eng_Latn it would have been too much trouble.
eng_Latn I come home on leave and I'll tell you how it was, I look and see that they are living better than before.
eng_Latn I know that, father.
eng_Latn but, there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference.
eng_Latn the two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by her
eng_Latn I ascended to my room, and lay down upon the bed.
eng_Latn her mother had come outside to take it right before school started.
eng_Latn I shut my eyes, trying to gather some courage
eng_Latn but of compelling magnetism, who was able within the space of one brief week and a few meetings to completely befuddle and enmesh her so that she was really his to do with as he wished.
eng_Latn I make no exceptions.
eng_Latn my spirits were depressed.
eng_Latn I passed on there, to say what I wanted, and to get a candle.
eng_Latn they were content to go down into obscurity with the molecatcher and the stone mason.
eng_Latn but I was young and stupid
eng_Latn an official among foreigners
eng_Latn but if thou livest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over
eng_Latn even a small one, was behind the order.
eng_Latn he had already bribed the magistrates and police,
eng_Latn as hard as if he were in his elbow chair, in his own study.
eng_Latn then asked carelessly what had happened that evening.
eng_Latn I need not burden myself with a purchase that I did not need.
eng_Latn all the life was gone out of it, and it looked weary and dead.
eng_Latn nd clutching at his head he ran downstairs.
eng_Latn There s no time for sleeping, Ineed to be spreading moon dust around the world...
eng_Latn it now unanimously and unconsciously yielded to weariness and at eleven thirty, broke up.
eng_Latn which was raised to the highest pitch of perfection by a mole she had on her right lip, like a moustache
eng_Latn I shall not have made any difference to you.
eng_Latn like a friend come back from a long absence.
eng_Latn I knew him
eng_Latn avoiding the farmer's eye and staring at the fire.
eng_Latn because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically fore announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy
eng_Latn while one might count ten
eng_Latn I wanted to buy a red rose for my mother.
eng_Latn I held my hand out to him, and he took it.
eng_Latn I know a lotta girls dont like him.
eng_Latn wine is only white magic.
eng_Latn you know, I'm not your boss.
eng_Latn they do what they want.
eng_Latn who followed out his first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable.
eng_Latn her face could have been described in terms of conventional prettiness
eng_Latn I must have been actuated by real uneasiness
eng_Latn so into the kitchen he went.
eng_Latn when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman walked in.
eng_Latn I make my way slowly back from the tube station to our street.
eng_Latn I just hope Pug has talked Mr Picasso into painting again.
eng_Latn I can't even organize one simple evening
eng_Latn eyes blinking dreamily at the flames.
eng_Latn But we were hoping...
eng_Latn that's a thousand times worse than unkindness!
eng_Latn Feel free to give it a go.
eng_Latn I was concealed by a column
eng_Latn she found the sidewalks just as crowded as they were at the height of the war
eng_Latn I do hope you have enjoyed your time in Granny Pug s Big Book Of Puzzles and that it will help you solve your own puzzles in...
eng_Latn What s that?!
eng_Latn on the contrary, I began and dressed myself carefully.
eng_Latn to do the master a mischief.
eng_Latn I know what was the trouble!
eng_Latn Oh Ah These wobbly stones are rather wobbly!
eng_Latn he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again
eng_Latn it was not an unfair sum for so fine an animal.
eng_Latn Awfully sorry. Didn t see youthere.
eng_Latn when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight
eng_Latn so now you know.
eng_Latn then I married a man I thought looked a little bit like you
eng_Latn then, adjust ing his belt, he went into the churchyard.
eng_Latn or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.
eng_Latn where she expected to find his answer.
eng_Latn the courtyard was full of carriages
eng_Latn I want nothing.
eng_Latn I will pass the rest of my life in venerating him.
eng_Latn if not himself would to deny that he had held any such relationship with her and so escape.
eng_Latn but whether for his own pleasure or that of his rider would have been difficult to say
eng_Latn Exploring... Snoring…AAh. Drawing!
eng_Latn suggested the plan of going over to see the grandmother.
eng_Latn I thought I spat on the ground and left him in disgust.
eng_Latn the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field.
eng_Latn was now a race of turbulent yellow waters.
eng_Latn When I was a pup, before I grew up.
eng_Latn but in the last three years or so he had lain on harder.
eng_Latn we're as close as we could be.
eng_Latn scenes that were rough and raw, gross and bestial.
eng_Latn told them how the matter stood
eng_Latn twice to go to the office, twice to return home
eng_Latn cupping his hands to the glass in an effort to peer in.
eng_Latn while he walked in the manner of one entirely oblivious of the meaning or compliment of this waiting throng.
eng_Latn I've loved you as if you were my own son.
eng_Latn hoping that such news would, like having a tooth out, completely cure him.
eng_Latn I wouldn't eat or drink here, if I were starving.
eng_Latn I haven't got a pencil and paper or I could work it out.
eng_Latn that is evident.
eng_Latn I beg you'll allow me to speak.
eng_Latn take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that 'ere dog.
eng_Latn come back for one moment to bless your penitent daughter.
eng_Latn it won't be borne!
eng_Latn I came to thank you for saving my father's life.
eng_Latn you have taken to working without pay.
eng_Latn I must have, I suppose.
eng_Latn but not mad.
eng_Latn steals over me again
eng_Latn then inhaled sharply.
eng_Latn who implored him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him.
eng_Latn he kept saying to himself that unless she would permit him to her room
eng_Latn was taking her usual place in the pretty sitting room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters
eng_Latn glided back out of the room.
eng_Latn for I will satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest.
eng_Latn I shall take the candle.
eng_Latn And what about us?
eng_Latn stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing what to do or say
eng_Latn which she guiltily slipped out of sight on my entrance.
eng_Latn if he would become confidential accountant.
eng_Latn I had engaged to call again next day
eng_Latn I have nothing for you to do.
eng_Latn I realized that what is between us is nothing more than an illusion.
eng_Latn in the taste displayed in furnishing, and in the rapidity with which it was executed
eng_Latn he could gaze down upon her whole person
eng_Latn waited in silence for him to finish speaking
eng_Latn looked in every way another man.
eng_Latn suddenly something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedcloth
eng_Latn on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living
eng_Latn but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering.
eng_Latn drawing comfort from the hope that she would not now be left entirely alone after his death.
eng_Latn stepped onto the foot of a spiral stone staircase
eng_Latn because she must either accept him or remain a prisoner
eng_Latn I feel them, and act them.
eng_Latn he went into the curate's pew before any one else arrived there.
eng_Latn I must tell you the truth.
eng_Latn so you are a baron now.
eng_Latn for I measured the latter on purpose, after my return.
eng_Latn rather it arrested the growth of softness and sweetness in him
eng_Latn Arrgh. Run !
eng_Latn OR Doctor Badd, the master of disguise!
eng_Latn the unlucky joke has gone so far
eng_Latn I am the Bellman. I hunt things. And the things I hunt mostly are Snark. So, will you help me?
eng_Latn by four in the afternoon she was successful.
eng_Latn I got rid of the signs of my work, and dropped the blanket and hid my saw, and pretty soon pap come in.
eng_Latn what it must be for a wife when she's never sure of her husband, when he hasn't got a principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by others than of getting his own toes pinched.
eng_Latn then there was the sound of a heavy fall, followed by a weary sigh.
eng_Latn where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him.
eng_Latn He s very energetic.
eng_Latn fell all his length upon his side, where he lay dead
eng_Latn he will not be wanted any more.
eng_Latn I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.
eng_Latn through acrack in the door, which was directly opposite him.
eng_Latn the best we can do now for the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
eng_Latn with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend.
eng_Latn their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy.
eng_Latn perhaps be my death.
eng_Latn she thanked him with an inclination of the head, and began smelling her bouquet.
eng_Latn which was the sign of no mere mechanical sprightliness, but of an eager intelligence.
eng_Latn till I get what I want.
eng_Latn maybe there was a corpse lying upstairs in the empty house.
eng_Latn during the year in which they had been married.
eng_Latn I'm going to die a son of a bitch.
eng_Latn for he finishes the building who feeds them.
eng_Latn All the ships will be safe.
eng_Latn as if her mind had become a fluid that flowed round things and enclosed them completely.
eng_Latn who had been sitting with his mouth hanging open
eng_Latn she was in that room in the west wing.
eng_Latn though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little trouble.
eng_Latn for in her heart she rather liked the peppery old lady.
eng_Latn Is that your balancing ball?
eng_Latn just now you have refused to kiss me.
eng_Latn because I think it is nice to be engaged.
eng_Latn only she would never have been willing to admit that.
eng_Latn they reflected little upon what a sauce open air sleeping make, too.
eng_Latn rattled out of the town right gallantly.
eng_Latn I handed it to him when I was finished.
eng_Latn he stiffly indicated a chair.
eng_Latn through the door which was now open to receive him
eng_Latn on purpose, so as to destroy your faith in me completely.
eng_Latn for we have our secret police department where private information is received.
eng_Latn is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring.
eng_Latn except they are mostly ugly natured birds who can see a long ways
eng_Latn having a brother matters to me more than anything else.
eng_Latn I am delighted to meet a compatriot.
eng_Latn truly I had little to say in return
eng_Latn would seem the very man to dart his iron
eng_Latn for she was very ill herself before she died.
eng_Latn without saying anything to her husband so
eng_Latn where it was certainly impossible for any one
eng_Latn on condition that she should never be separated from hiM
eng_Latn I need someone like you.
eng_Latn this time he had been facing five unarmed boys, four of whom were asleep.
eng_Latn Gosh Dog. Wow the owl knows LOTS more things than you do!
eng_Latn for which I had a warrant.
eng_Latn what is not ready I'll send after you.
eng_Latn idealistic, eighteen year old boy he had been.
eng_Latn when I closed them
eng_Latn for he shook his head by way of disapprobation.
eng_Latn but he thought that in time the impulsive young girl would let herself be guided by his reason and experience.
eng_Latn She can t say that Dog. You saythat.
eng_Latn but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed.
eng_Latn I dare say she was very much pleased with you.
eng_Latn they didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to it.
eng_Latn Dog unwrapped books.
eng_Latn which was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen.
eng_Latn the last name of the mother
eng_Latn he had added in a tone between jest and earnest.
eng_Latn I won't leave a nook or corner of the whole village that I won't search for the house, castle, or palace, of my lady
eng_Latn went ashore there, joined a discovery party
eng_Latn so that, when he awoke startled, he was unable to move
eng_Latn but still he had been in his mind
eng_Latn I could see his sardonic smile.
eng_Latn where no doubt he ordinarily had his station.
eng_Latn unrolling his own homework
eng_Latn new ways to help us make a richer life for ourselves
eng_Latn swaying slowly from side to side, had drawn nearer to the young woman
eng_Latn but it was enough.
eng_Latn in two months after my return, I again left my native country.
eng_Latn he said I must make a finished picture of it.
eng_Latn it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad.
eng_Latn I never had my family stuck out on the road.
eng_Latn Ah! How about becoming the first Pug to reach The Pole?
eng_Latn foreseeing some new catastrophe.
eng_Latn in a great fright gave him a very confused account of what he had seen.
eng_Latn my father and mother and my sister, and my mother cried when she looked at it.
eng_Latn I saw her innocently kiss her chosen husband on the cheek, and creep close to his bluff form as if it were her best support.
eng_Latn you have still on your brow your master's blood!
eng_Latn I go for all
eng_Latn he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled
eng_Latn but failing now that he had reversed the handle.
eng_Latn sunrise to sunset.
eng_Latn took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.
eng_Latn I shouldn't trouble.
eng_Latn raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went.
eng_Latn I don't believe you!
eng_Latn the evil for him that goes to look for it
eng_Latn more effectively than a rampaging rhino.
eng_Latn with a chimney sweep driving the hearse advised by the regular driver
eng_Latn it was a jumble without taste or truth.
eng_Latn yellin' your head off.
eng_Latn began to pin her rose in her head dress
eng_Latn That s because it's a music festival boys.
eng_Latn I seated myself in a chair, and rocked to and fro
eng_Latn temperature 45 degrees
eng_Latn I would goaway with her and marry her.
eng_Latn I am not exactly tired of my life, though I am so poor that I can carry all I have with myself on my horse's back.
eng_Latn I had to remind myself of the need for caution.
eng_Latn but, first tell me
eng_Latn the only one by which he could descend
eng_Latn I took an unnecessary breath to settle myself.
eng_Latn ..I love to sit quietly and...
eng_Latn for I had quite forgot the faculty of lying
eng_Latn I've run here all the way.
eng_Latn just as I heard a massive crack.
eng_Latn But which is the right answerGranny Pug?
eng_Latn but it's safest not to tempt fate.
eng_Latn understand or endure this sudden rift in their wonderful friendship.
eng_Latn but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.
eng_Latn the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.
eng_Latn but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning, and saved myself.
eng_Latn there are too many people in this world ready to meddle in the affairs of others and make mischief between them.
eng_Latn but you need to realize that those things specifically applied to me.
eng_Latn especially if they are sweet and have plums in them.
eng_Latn the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons
eng_Latn three cigars in my pocket to help me spend the day on this island.
eng_Latn then started to climb, fast as he could
eng_Latn And they all lived excitingly everafter. The end.
eng_Latn I love you.
eng_Latn so beautiful that one is afraid to look at you.
eng_Latn though it wasn't.
eng_Latn here it may, perhaps, divert the curious reader, to give some account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a residence of nine months, and thirteen days.
eng_Latn I've got to get out of this place
eng_Latn but there were a dozen different accounts of how he had achieved his vast fortune, some of them not flattering.
eng_Latn the coast was clear for them to leave the bathroom
eng_Latn have the other fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey
eng_Latn bouquets were placed in a row the whole length of the table
eng_Latn because he had other things to think of.
eng_Latn I have no idea of that sort of thing.
eng_Latn to endure the suffering as lovingly
eng_Latn the cossacks went their ways
eng_Latn but it must be brought to a head.
eng_Latn I am sure it's quite half through your lodging you have become so melancholy.
eng_Latn I sat down and waited
eng_Latn will rain as often as it pleases me and may be needful.
eng_Latn who is now in his mid forties
eng_Latn without giving a thought to 'that stupendous invention
eng_Latn NOW are you satisfied?
eng_Latn even to a liqueur stand in his room!
eng_Latn rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it
eng_Latn definitely I made up my mind that I'd spend it
eng_Latn I just took that because it was the only chance I saw of getting up to town.
eng_Latn I bawled until it seemed I'd never stop.
eng_Latn it was again opened for the count.
eng_Latn but the baby is so used to her that we've gone on keeping her still.
eng_Latn bending her body as a sign that she returned thanks.
eng_Latn but by the quarter, and all lay open to view in a great chest.
eng_Latn not tasting the soup
eng_Latn he forced himself forward until the toe of his shoe struck the soldier's hand again.
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book that will tell us how to look for it?
eng_Latn I now declare openly, in the presence of these witnesses, that I will do so.
eng_Latn as if he had lost the habit of associating place with sound
eng_Latn it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion.
eng_Latn I can't figure out what it wants.
eng_Latn I asked you as soon as I came into the room
eng_Latn especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning
eng_Latn threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness
eng_Latn we had better take the opposite direction, eh?
eng_Latn but in order to have known everything so well you must have been an eye witness
eng_Latn he would furnish me with all things necessary.
eng_Latn he believed all he had read of him
eng_Latn because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore castle deck.
eng_Latn so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites
eng_Latn I didn't walk all this way here tonight just to tell you all good by.
eng_Latn perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards.
eng_Latn but it wasn't going to be alone in that muddy ditch.
eng_Latn my cavalier has attained his object
eng_Latn When the ship sank Colin was washedup on a tiny island, miles from anywhere, all by himself.
eng_Latn I realised in myself the same desire as animated him.
eng_Latn scoured away at his hardest speed.
eng_Latn where no doubt he ordinarily had his station.
eng_Latn after their manner, as we shall describe in its proper place
eng_Latn Found it!
eng_Latn let us join them, and lay together our own.
eng_Latn Deep, into the dark depths ofthe ancient pyramid went the intrepid treasure hunters
eng_Latn but if the advice was that the palace security troops needed extensive further training and a crash course, at that
eng_Latn to speak about the small delinquent who had been caught with the leveret.
eng_Latn The game is afoot.
eng_Latn ther'll be an idiot short.
eng_Latn he had some other feelings towards women than towards grouse and foxes
eng_Latn somebody in the landlady way, or lodging letting way'and marry her, against a rainy day.
eng_Latn I was too amazed and excited and bewildered and happy.
eng_Latn warned me to keep my mouth shut.
eng_Latn I had to grasp the table again to keep myself in my seat.
eng_Latn the four that were on horseback, who were of highbred appearance and bearing, dismounted
eng_Latn then his face fell.
eng_Latn a man sitting fast asleep next to the window.
eng_Latn but remembered that it had involved sex and death.
eng_Latn her eye glancing on her sweetheart, who is near me.
eng_Latn was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way.
eng_Latn where he revived his noisy revelry and unlimited gourmandizing.
eng_Latn OK! I promise I'll forget all about it.
eng_Latn so that I've been unable to send you anything all this time.
eng_Latn her spirits rose.
eng_Latn but she detests me because I have genius.
eng_Latn weighing the pieces on a pharmacist's scale, and calculating its breadth with a gunsmith's calipers.
eng_Latn It's me.
eng_Latn I shut the door again.
eng_Latn ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise them.
eng_Latn because the house stood just at the end of the town, with a garden and stables attached,
eng_Latn had been chiefly his own teacher
eng_Latn to see to his horse.
eng_Latn I suggested that he should go home for a while.
eng_Latn but only when all goes well with him.
eng_Latn I make a snap decision.
eng_Latn I am come back in my quality of doctor, he said.
eng_Latn the second by striking against a rock.
eng_Latn I offer you a beggar, my lord.
eng_Latn I'd hate to think of him hiding under a rock for the next decade.
eng_Latn he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success.
eng_Latn now return to your own room.
eng_Latn What an excellent time to practicean emergency stop, Pug.
eng_Latn we must often take some.
eng_Latn I am engaged in a work of very great moment.
eng_Latn to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality.
eng_Latn Once Upon a time, high in the sky,a broom was zooming and having a problem
eng_Latn his pain had been so great that he had thought quite seriously of committing suicide.
eng_Latn the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours.
eng_Latn cold chicken maybe
eng_Latn were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace
eng_Latn Come and get your lovely juicy leaf-
eng_Latn for I was troubled with no inquiries no surmises.
eng_Latn of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end.
eng_Latn held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity
eng_Latn I had to have some help.
eng_Latn I believed I could bear it if I were certain that nobody knew of this but our two selves.
eng_Latn I sure will.
eng_Latn to humble myself so to her is painful.
eng_Latn That s the last of the snow and there s not far to go. Look!
eng_Latn from having been a soldier in his youth
eng_Latn the village was behind them.
eng_Latn the expression of his large brows softening
eng_Latn to behold a rift in the immense blue pane of the firmament!
eng_Latn but instead had handed himthe letter and half a dollar.
eng_Latn for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.
eng_Latn that it had no closed helmet, nothing but a simple morion.
eng_Latn I didnt expect that you could get it all for me
eng_Latn its probably what I need.
eng_Latn I say we have been here eighty three hours.
eng_Latn now declared that he had seen and examined it there and that th ewounds
eng_Latn That s the mouth that never says a nice word.
eng_Latn I have never been out of my own land before.
eng_Latn yet she did not abandon what she had planned to do.
eng_Latn but finding it impossible
eng_Latn secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.
eng_Latn to scratch his back with a long handled back scratcher
eng_Latn I have enough without that.
eng_Latn speaking any language but his own
eng_Latn Tourism finds a way.
eng_Latn security which could sustain it.
eng_Latn especially in inculcating the religion of rowing.
eng_Latn but I went away and roared with laughter.
eng_Latn I love my daughter with one love, and her with another.
eng_Latn I don't want to just now!
eng_Latn she feels the better for being out of court.
eng_Latn punctually followed the directions he had received
eng_Latn I checked them all out.
eng_Latn Granny Pug s Guide To Caves and Caverns.
eng_Latn by no means in the latter's favour.
eng_Latn which I then thought most unreasonable.
eng_Latn then he walked slowly back the way that he had come
eng_Latn I'm sure, between the five of us, we can keep it from turning into bloodshed.
eng_Latn drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler
eng_Latn he hid himself to weep.
eng_Latn cried the young girl
eng_Latn I shut off the engine and got out.
eng_Latn I'll come tomorrow.
eng_Latn Well, batten my hatches and serve em with chips, it be Dog and Pug.
eng_Latn here you will find arms in their supreme excellence
eng_Latn he was holding out a pair of pinstriped trousers and almost crying with exasperation.
eng_Latn then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.
eng_Latn I liked that I'd finally guessed right.
eng_Latn I didn't follow you because I was after a promotion.
eng_Latn I'd been standing with her and then pulled her out of the way till her eager listeners got bored and stopped looking for more details.
eng_Latn I can remember it vividly now
eng_Latn seemed to understand, but would say nothing.
eng_Latn I amsimply stating, as a matter of fact and of law, that this boy wasnot formally engaged to this dead girl.
eng_Latn Let's get to work...
eng_Latn am very glad to make a closer acquaintance with you.
eng_Latn I'm in this lady's hands from now on.
eng_Latn I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded.
eng_Latn but she sat with her own back and the back of the large chair towards it
eng_Latn tell mama she is run out into the rain
eng_Latn when she turned back the expression was gone.
eng_Latn (cheering)
eng_Latn more than I could naturally bear.
eng_Latn aimed it a yard on one side on purpose, for fear of hurting him.
eng_Latn But together..
eng_Latn I had a great power.
eng_Latn sending him reeling backward onto the grass.
eng_Latn he was too far away to tell
eng_Latn before he came to sea
eng_Latn if only he were not as treacherously surrounded as he was here.
eng_Latn you see, it would be your own business.
eng_Latn kissed his hand.
eng_Latn you may as well keep a pack of hounds.
eng_Latn some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her.
eng_Latn so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning
eng_Latn was back again in a few seconds in a frock coat.
eng_Latn it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish one.
eng_Latn but I was impatiently waiting for your arrival
eng_Latn to be champions always ready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour, conduct, and fidelity.
eng_Latn but died of a bad fever by excessive drinking.
eng_Latn too miserable to speak.
eng_Latn explained that he had not been able to sleep a wink all night because of the silence.
eng_Latn that was his style
eng_Latn that their life began to go more smoothly.
eng_Latn some in their own happiness
eng_Latn And it is called...
eng_Latn they hardly heeded this detail.
eng_Latn without thinking beyond the immediate cause
eng_Latn had succeeded in making him more or less than man.
eng_Latn I shall carry the mark to my grave.
eng_Latn set forth again
eng_Latn I had to keep the mills going!
eng_Latn I ran swiftly up the stairs and hid in the gallery.
eng_Latn it's unseemly for you.
eng_Latn then back to the common room once more, with sunburnt necks
eng_Latn for, in spite of you and your ass
eng_Latn eave us alone for a moment.
eng_Latn made a mouth at him
eng_Latn never quite going under completely
eng_Latn Row! Row! Row!
eng_Latn but I'm damned if I sympathize.
eng_Latn little by little delivered up to him the secret of the enchanted land.
eng_Latn I told him that you had been sick, but you were fine now
eng_Latn which was much admired in that part of the country.
eng_Latn I think that's very unfair, ' I said.
eng_Latn at that very moment, or it would be too late.
eng_Latn I'm not doing any good here.
eng_Latn but it's a ticklish job to put a live wasp on the hook.
eng_Latn how sensible the sound was
eng_Latn he began to get ready to drive into town, and again to his mother's to get her signature to the deeds.
eng_Latn acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants.
eng_Latn I will not agree to take her without your full and willing consent.
eng_Latn was on his way to becoming a saint.
eng_Latn but I hope I have not offended you.
eng_Latn but soon the last light from thelast stall vanished.
eng_Latn Come on Dog, our turn to trip-trap across now...
eng_Latn an anguished wish to turn back the calendar.
eng_Latn had a good cry.
eng_Latn what a wonderful man he is!
eng_Latn I was under great difficulties between urgency and shame.
eng_Latn lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.
eng_Latn I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future movements.
eng_Latn she found a half used jar of smooth peanut butter.
eng_Latn which as I have already described, was a very convenient closet, of twelve feet wide.
eng_Latn I will not stir.
eng_Latn till the bell rang.
eng_Latn I was taken aback by her assumption that I knew all about her domestic misfortune.
eng_Latn thou will at once engage in this love struggle
eng_Latn I wasso glad to see your ugly old phiz that I just dropped in to say howdy.
eng_Latn finally they led him out of his cell onto the square and there was a long horse trough
eng_Latn let it fall, with a shudder.
eng_Latn so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.
eng_Latn the familiar helpless anger now compounded by the dull throb in his head.
eng_Latn but spare her the trial of poverty
eng_Latn then you will know the happiness of forgiving.
eng_Latn I don't mind telling you, I'm getting a hell of a lot of pressure to do something about her.
eng_Latn as much dashing about as in those days
eng_Latn by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had been expended.
eng_Latn that is to live in peace as long as heaven grants me life.
eng_Latn it ends by making a snowball!
eng_Latn I shook my head reprovingly
eng_Latn for setting so ill an example to the kingdom
eng_Latn I can't see him anywhere.
eng_Latn I am one of the principal characters of the play
eng_Latn it struck sharp on the inn door
eng_Latn we had the room to ourselves.
eng_Latn three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were mechanically.
eng_Latn she decided, and going back to her former thoughts,
eng_Latn of childlike light heartedness that she particularly liked in him.
eng_Latn where she expected to find his answer.
eng_Latn What an excellent idea Pug. Cats love cream.
eng_Latn Just the place for a Bellman said the Snark with a smile. Then she counted from zero to ten. And they played hide and seek till the end of last week and never went hunting again.’
eng_Latn I came with father.
eng_Latn I'm not going to think about that for approximately six and a half more years.
eng_Latn I'm not going to mention any names.
eng_Latn after its first intensity has warmed the air
eng_Latn every notary bears within him the debris of a poet.
eng_Latn she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman.
eng_Latn so deeply scared he hardly dared admit it 'to himself.
eng_Latn This is a book about not being seen and it is called...
eng_Latn it is ten years to day since I saved your father's life
eng_Latn she was courting him, giving him the opportunity he was seeking, wishing him to take advantage of it.
eng_Latn but you're not going to die about that.
eng_Latn for herself to which she looked forward with trembling hope
eng_Latn we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
eng_Latn Bow-Wowzer! Please may I have adish of cream, your highness?
eng_Latn at that moment made his way through the crowd
eng_Latn I too am a man like the rest of you.
eng_Latn on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.
eng_Latn I hope you may be able to think so well of me
eng_Latn I had much ado to defend myself against these detestable animals
eng_Latn he toppled gently onto the grass with
eng_Latn even if it was only for two minutes.
eng_Latn a closed car of great size and solidity stopped directly in front of it.
eng_Latn who would ever make much of a stir in this game.
eng_Latn an optical illusion which every one has experienced.
eng_Latn left her quite distressed, with her head hanging down over the keys.
eng_Latn I should be very unhappy.
eng_Latn if not, to defend him to the limit of the law.
eng_Latn to avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.
eng_Latn it probably smelled good to everyone else.
eng_Latn That s VERY good.
eng_Latn pressing her son's hand, affectionately
eng_Latn therefore I durst not so much as stop my nose.
eng_Latn took off and handed over his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight.
eng_Latn I never noticed before your hair has red in it.
eng_Latn if n you don't fight off his power
eng_Latn sign it with blood.
eng_Latn when he hasn't got a principle in him to make him more afraid of doing the wrong thing by others than of getting his own toes pinched.
eng_Latn as if each had felt respectively that a masterful conviction, as well as utter scepticism, may lead a man very far on the by paths of political action.
eng_Latn it was the stupid eye of a poor innocent seven and fifty years of age
eng_Latn You re the worst brother/sisterEVER!
eng_Latn though there was no one about.
eng_Latn Here, naughty bookshop mices!
eng_Latn just as he had been three days before at the elder's, at the family meeting with his father and brothers.
eng_Latn to be afraid that it was all a mistake and I'd made a fool of myself for nothing.
eng_Latn hungry for news of it.
eng_Latn Really?
eng_Latn then she ate her cold meat
eng_Latn even though we both knew it would never happen.
eng_Latn I looked surprised.
eng_Latn incredibly and phenomenally so.
eng_Latn then turned to find the bay mares gentle eyes fixed on him.
eng_Latn looked so kindly and loving in his face
eng_Latn yet, by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her, that he was the cause of her unhappiness
eng_Latn spread it out on a table
eng_Latn when the young man entered, I am sure I knew what he had been doing.
eng_Latn if I have any principles left.
eng_Latn with his solitary knee fixed in the semi circular depression in the cleat
eng_Latn it would be difficult to say
eng_Latn only then for the first time the whole thing presented itself in a new, different aspect
eng_Latn for he had used seven of his dozen rockets
eng_Latn And no one s arguing about who sits next to you, Sire. With this round table, we re all near to you!
eng_Latn let's stop and see the fun.
eng_Latn I told you that this is what would happen to you.
eng_Latn standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.
eng_Latn but I want to break you in gently.
eng_Latn If only that were possible, myfriend. But, alas I have mislaid my top hat and magic wand. Without them I am unable to perform.
eng_Latn with his forehead crushed in.
eng_Latn the chances that may come to us on the way.
eng_Latn Some people believe nothing can go on forever Pug.
eng_Latn I'm just not yet brave enough tomeet new friends.
eng_Latn because whatever you do, you will be sorry all the rest of your life if you say no.
eng_Latn I wouldn't shake my NIGGER
eng_Latn but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut.
eng_Latn asked the young girl
eng_Latn let me see your pictures.
eng_Latn sent word to the livery stable to release the horse and buggy.
eng_Latn he cried, beaming around him
eng_Latn neither of whom seemed to pay much attention to him.
eng_Latn I will owe my fortune to nothing but my own exertions.
eng_Latn neither ship nor boat to be seen.
eng_Latn as soon as he could excused himself from the table.
eng_Latn I'll thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head.
eng_Latn I never returned to the country where she lived
eng_Latn by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised
eng_Latn bent over the body.
eng_Latn No it didn t Dog. But now we don t have to.
eng_Latn beat the quarter all that night.
eng_Latn What happens next?
eng_Latn till, hours before dawn, I had the men up and made them load
eng_Latn only, I should think, a better portrait.
eng_Latn how any of us happened to want them?
eng_Latn a witness was called to identify him
eng_Latn followed his master on his professional mission.
eng_Latn her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands
eng_Latn casting one glance towards the young man
eng_Latn I asked her for it long ago.
eng_Latn she found herself well matched in a partner.
eng_Latn cracked it over his own head
eng_Latn I shall perish if you do not take me away.
eng_Latn before giving his signature he must give a rather strong admonition.
eng_Latn I set eyes on him
eng_Latn I am weary.
eng_Latn as he ascended the stairs leading to his wife's room
eng_Latn though it's not important.
eng_Latn but I know neither the street nor the number
eng_Latn I was waiting for the right moment to act.
eng_Latn for he who sings once weeps all his life.
eng_Latn Would you like to be a cat?
eng_Latn What a great party Dog.
eng_Latn I have argued it myself.
eng_Latn gave me the kindest words and the best advice.
eng_Latn the girl ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left
eng_Latn so feeble had action become in him
eng_Latn there is no part of the county where opinion is narrower than it is here
eng_Latn Will there ever be a time I don t learn anything new?
eng_Latn but taking the offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place
eng_Latn as he rose and took his place upon the stand
eng_Latn I'm sorry I called you a spy and a fool.
eng_Latn he says that young people ought to be left alone for a while at first.
eng_Latn there being only a few officers
eng_Latn remarked that this had more the look of blows than of a fall.
eng_Latn for I durst not return to the same landing place
eng_Latn as he shook his head.
eng_Latn her head covered
eng_Latn I'll tell you where to aim it when the time's right.
eng_Latn a frightfully grand woman!
eng_Latn one can't permit the land to be pillaged
eng_Latn I lay on my side watching it.
eng_Latn flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile.
eng_Latn that is evident.
eng_Latn he'd be mitch obleeged to us to gang on a bit further.
eng_Latn had burned the dimming piles of nostalgic waste that life had accumulated in her heart
eng_Latn before the afternoon was done
eng_Latn I asked the reason.
eng_Latn I tried all day two days.
eng_Latn as well those that are the king's as those belonging to private individuals
eng_Latn waited for the portrait hole to open.
eng_Latn that is what I intended.
eng_Latn there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm.
eng_Latn but whose family now will not allow him to wed the daughter of a ruined man
eng_Latn Five pairs of what?
eng_Latn I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week.
eng_Latn how she would order her life now, after that.
eng_Latn not better that a son should have killed his father, I don't defend that.
eng_Latn I don t think biscuits do grow ontrees Pug.
eng_Latn she added quietly.
eng_Latn I saw him at the ministers' houses.
eng_Latn I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her!
eng_Latn I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
eng_Latn I stuff the safety instructions quickly back in their pocket
eng_Latn but not mad.
eng_Latn that he hadn't met a nicer girl in the islands.
eng_Latn but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom.
eng_Latn he had only to reach out his hand to take his pen
eng_Latn that gave me a chance to truly compose and resolve myself.
eng_Latn to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion,
eng_Latn it's the sight of your mental struggles when a matter of principle is laid up against something practical like money.
eng_Latn I've been here for an hour
eng_Latn or it may be looked at simply and even humorously.
eng_Latn it ends by making a snowball!
eng_Latn from there sent the nation a call to general war.
eng_Latn to be assured of his genius, first of all
eng_Latn by perfectly legitimate means, acquired inhis business.
eng_Latn she had lost all heart for action
eng_Latn looked through a spyglass at the streams of his
eng_Latn I've run here all the way.
eng_Latn that man's brother saw her and admired her
eng_Latn with whom I received four hundred pounds for a portion.
eng_Latn here the court was convulsed
eng_Latn I've elected economics this year very illuminating subject.
eng_Latn endeavoring to read her husband's inmost thoughts
eng_Latn in that moment, and for the moment, she was aware of a rift that showed in her certitude
eng_Latn Hello. I am Dog and this is Pug. We seek the Wumpus.
eng_Latn which exactly suited me.
eng_Latn that there was no getting around the stubborn fact
eng_Latn the cossacks,troubled by the unusual word comrade
eng_Latn I love books that...
eng_Latn I confess I had my suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty.
eng_Latn having evidently reflected and decided how to act
eng_Latn showing that his views of the womanly nature were sufficiently large to include that requirement.
eng_Latn he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it.
eng_Latn her parents would object to her staying out so late.
eng_Latn D-d-dog I don t think I like this!
eng_Latn Awh How am I going to get my photos ifit keeps camouflaging itself?
eng_Latn the sailor would have been stifled before he could draw his cutlass.
eng_Latn his wish to meet it without troubling his father
eng_Latn the whirling storm continued all night.
eng_Latn I glance at my watch and see with a dart of shock that it's 9. 15.
eng_Latn he wished him to continue writing at intervals
eng_Latn Holmes!
eng_Latn there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it
eng_Latn I had an odd urge to blinklike I was staring at the sun.
eng_Latn but and always will be, pseudo healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths.
eng_Latn as to the necessity of unremitting effort to secure the lasting welfare of the country emerging after this last struggle, he hoped, into a period of peace and material prosperity.
eng_Latn I'd like to see you try it.
eng_Latn Hmm The Arctic... Aberdeen...Ah ANTARCTICA
eng_Latn I acted like a madman in coming in here
eng_Latn I won't stray five yards from your window.
eng_Latn I love sitting back and reading a book in perfect peace and quie...
eng_Latn Once upon a time there was a placewhere animals of all shapes and sizes lived together
eng_Latn That is a sound I keep hearingaround.
eng_Latn Not Yet Pug. This isn t the righttime in the story.
eng_Latn one bent to the left and the other to the right.
eng_Latn tears in her eyes at the jeering note in his voice.
eng_Latn but I never liked him.
eng_Latn snuffed this smell and that and thus wasted some seconds.
eng_Latn she went to his heart and made him more gentle with her than he had ever been with any person in all the world.
eng_Latn should take so much trouble and show me so much kindness.
eng_Latn I turned around, wrapping my arms around his cool waist.
eng_Latn I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed to the ground after that four thousand.
eng_Latn Pilates.. Pyrotechnics.. PIRATES!
eng_Latn is a perfectly venial offence in our sight.
eng_Latn on which he was invited again for the following week to dine and stay the night.
eng_Latn had asked him if he knew of a doctor who could aid a young married woman
eng_Latn was he awake or was it but a dream
eng_Latn this was furnished like the first, only after a more elegant manner.
eng_Latn why had he allowed that doctor to go!
eng_Latn I must speak.
eng_Latn only for the purpose of securing an armed peace
eng_Latn mostly because her brain was already on to something else.
eng_Latn the next all was winter and blackness again.
eng_Latn lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer
eng_Latn the shop was not closed
eng_Latn as to allow these two lovers to live in peace and quiet
eng_Latn dark like the fallow earth that waits for the good seed
eng_Latn for the cost of the lawsuits had been prodigious, that, though she was infinitely noble again, she was also excessively poor.
eng_Latn That…
eng_Latn Pet dragon Pug.
eng_Latn I have been here so long
eng_Latn especially as he had unwarily told her, in a moment of frankness,
eng_Latn that made them men.
eng_Latn I'm going to invite the two young men.
eng_Latn I was fairly mad at him.
eng_Latn his pipe being by this time smoked out
eng_Latn that his woman who I also won't name was spending her afternoon sack time with a third party
eng_Latn he laughs at your committee because it's the old way and the old ways are his ways
eng_Latn giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard
eng_Latn I could teach you in a few minutes if you wanted me to.
eng_Latn I shall expect you every day
eng_Latn is intimately connected with the affair.
eng_Latn I must go off at once.
eng_Latn forgot her flighty conduct and their disapproval of it
eng_Latn never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
eng_Latn or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which the advertiser is
eng_Latn did I have a chance to hope she might be dreaming of me.
eng_Latn I blinked a few times
eng_Latn it is too warm to hang about your friends.
eng_Latn It does have a catchy beat.
eng_Latn they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night
eng_Latn owner's servant, landsman
eng_Latn that was courage.
eng_Latn but just as when one quits a religious community before making profession
eng_Latn I can t see if the mice are doing good dancing or not.
eng_Latn had none of her husband's low toned pallor.
eng_Latn how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him.
eng_Latn let us go hence ere night come on and surprise us in these wilds.
eng_Latn stand centre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.
eng_Latn for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband's cheerfully.
eng_Latn the strange fascination some men have for utterly demanding labor.
eng_Latn his horse fell and his ankle is sprained.
eng_Latn I pledged them for ten roubles.
eng_Latn I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it.
eng_Latn but when they were seated at tea
eng_Latn Perhaps we should find the Snark before he does.
eng_Latn I seem to have feathers under my head.
eng_Latn better than four cities or four judgeships at court.
eng_Latn any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first.
eng_Latn she does so want to see you.
eng_Latn of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion
eng_Latn tied her cravat
eng_Latn without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them.
eng_Latn but they were leaning on them while they watched the game.
eng_Latn begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke.
eng_Latn he had no need to be surrounded by beautiful things.
eng_Latn the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street
eng_Latn that is, if you want me to.
eng_Latn to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor
eng_Latn I had too many more important things to obsess over.
eng_Latn he struck at them right and left in his blindness
eng_Latn after I had read these words from over the way, that I went across the road and looked in.
eng_Latn presented itself to his mind
eng_Latn one extreme, as always happens, was met by representatives of the other.
eng_Latn I seen it was that way.
eng_Latn I am sure there is something the matter.
eng_Latn quite stupefied and benumbed at finding himself in your magnificent presence.
eng_Latn fell like stones to the ground.
eng_Latn he aimed high at the spider's underbelly
eng_Latn both of them had a moment of complete childish joy.
eng_Latn he thought he had never seen any so good as this.
eng_Latn for my paper, which gave the first information on the subject
eng_Latn freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's hands.
eng_Latn cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master
eng_Latn Fishermen will save us?
eng_Latn basing his refusal on the ground that the applicant was a notorious gambler and cheat
eng_Latn it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.
eng_Latn how she had only just put on her new shoes for the benefit of the visitor, and on going into the drawing room
eng_Latn he'd wrecked something very big this time
eng_Latn I am so glad you are come.
eng_Latn at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right
eng_Latn that the child would have grown up and have sinned
eng_Latn I fix my gaze on it alone
eng_Latn he can't do anything about it.
eng_Latn it is unreasonable to presume that a young man of sense and character would attempt it
eng_Latn our arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.
eng_Latn with that he winked
eng_Latn I push my hair back off my face.
eng_Latn I want you to grant us an exception.
eng_Latn Ooo!
eng_Latn Pick a card. Any card.
eng_Latn which she never meant to send.
eng_Latn she was also very popular.
eng_Latn he would have done anything to escape his happiness.
eng_Latn Let us count to three, then turnaround together....
eng_Latn swallowed with difficulty because his throat was dry.
eng_Latn it's your company and it was your decision and you had every right to make it.
eng_Latn it is no longer possible or right that I should conceal from thee.
eng_Latn Oh. I thought we d be in a theatre. I ve brought popcorn.
eng_Latn he rid the room of him and closed the door.
eng_Latn then when she came down that night she was going to have told you all about it.
eng_Latn is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes
eng_Latn It's a lovely place Dog.
eng_Latn I'll leave in the morning.
eng_Latn which had been ringing without pause since the previous day.
eng_Latn what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with them?
eng_Latn I'm the seaman who's got to join his ship here.
eng_Latn Dog and Pug, let s go home!
eng_Latn I was not quite sure when you first came that you were the same man.
eng_Latn raising his knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out.
eng_Latn Good job he has this bright light to guide him.
eng_Latn Hello Brrrr,fancy coming to aparty in a tropical forest.
eng_Latn or perhaps you don't like to be called 'my dear fellow' and 'old man! ' _tout court_?
eng_Latn but she drew him quickly and firmly away.
eng_Latn turned a deaf ear to her pleas
eng_Latn except in so far as it touches upon his character.
eng_Latn I have always sought to revenge my illustrious father
eng_Latn because he had returned to the childhood his children had taken away from him.
eng_Latn they came out of his wand
eng_Latn he offered his homages to madame and his respects to monsieur
eng_Latn but as far as I know the facts, I can't.
eng_Latn I made the captain a very low bow
eng_Latn the contemplation of life and conduct through the lens furnished by a purely sectarian creed.
eng_Latn covering myself with my own clothes
eng_Latn decided to take the rest of the day off.
eng_Latn they fitted me exactly.
eng_Latn than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave.
eng_Latn it will amuse you.
eng_Latn And he likes to dance.
eng_Latn I could only surmise what his course of action would be.
eng_Latn too much so to preserve innocence or unawareness.
eng_Latn letting the car come almost to a standstill.
eng_Latn to see to his horse.
eng_Latn when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town
eng_Latn but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two.
eng_Latn I was a little fool then, I know
eng_Latn he with that broke off
eng_Latn being out in the country and needing another self presumably
eng_Latn took steady aim, and fired.
eng_Latn They say it is covered in fur. Theysay it walks like a man. They say it leave strange footprints in the snow!
eng_Latn that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister.
eng_Latn I had left it on the divan, and it had been picked up.
eng_Latn you must still fight your own battle.
eng_Latn How curious... and familiar.
eng_Latn sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation.
eng_Latn forgetting everything but her fingers on my skin.
eng_Latn I haven't quite sorted out your stuff yet
eng_Latn he be obeyed.
eng_Latn all the father you'll have in a few days
eng_Latn especially after she began to jitter apart like some indifferently made toy.
eng_Latn topped with a stuffed vulture.
eng_Latn Get back to work you bilge lovingbarnacle!
eng_Latn I've never wanted anything so much.
eng_Latn whose scar began to burn so fiercely that he almost screamed in agony.
eng_Latn I don't mean to act any more after this time.
eng_Latn I shall soon be out of the way of harming you
eng_Latn but by the time he realized that he had been swindled
eng_Latn And so we bid farewell to the Wonderful World of Kites, where sticks, paper and dreams can take flight together.
eng_Latn wait till you've got a beard to your chin.
eng_Latn t's hate against us, worse, it's emptiness.
eng_Latn for as he has restored me to my original condition
eng_Latn her great pity had taught her silence.
eng_Latn as I have done many a time before
eng_Latn the enormity of her relief showing in the way she sat
eng_Latn so that with the next trial, he came forth in the good old way head foremost.
eng_Latn I was too amazed and excited and bewildered and happy.
eng_Latn he most certainly had been.
eng_Latn fretting about the dulness of the house
eng_Latn which, however, I take for a great compliment.
eng_Latn you are dearer to me than anyone in the world.
eng_Latn he had been with him now long enough to know how his mind worked.
eng_Latn I started up in bed, and putting out my arms in the dark
eng_Latn I explained that I wanted two thousand of them.
eng_Latn I had just enough strength to lie there unmoving while I was charred alive.
eng_Latn it would have been too much trouble.
eng_Latn considering her exclusive devotion to him, might prove embarrassing.
eng_Latn I may count on you
eng_Latn finally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until my arrival.
eng_Latn Do you have any doggy biscuits?
eng_Latn I focused on my poker face.
eng_Latn placing his pocketbook under his pillow.
eng_Latn could anyone be more entirely lost than I?
eng_Latn but I got some batteries from the hardware store.
eng_Latn to force her to look up at him.
eng_Latn I made the little clearing then, moving immediately to the point.
eng_Latn as he had no surname, and we could not tell his age
eng_Latn has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross?
eng_Latn I'll kill him.
eng_Latn as to set aside all impediments
eng_Latn but a determined woman.
eng_Latn in my hands the two sheets of paper on which I had scribbled the story.
eng_Latn the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of aninhabitant of the faubourg
eng_Latn but if you would leave the postboy to say that
eng_Latn I hope you have enjoyed my guide to all the places you can pitch your tent.
eng_Latn pulling down the bloodsoaked shorts to see blood soaked flesh, shivering.
eng_Latn I will try not to bore you too much.
eng_Latn I didn't do it against their will.
eng_Latn in his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold
eng_Latn but she did not fear her competitors.
eng_Latn get away from the sphinx unharmed
eng_Latn gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line.
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn no one will believe it.
eng_Latn he began to get ready to drive into town, and again to his mother's to get her signature to the deeds.
eng_Latn had made an interesting comment the day before on that subject.
eng_Latn but there was such a leaden dread at his heart
eng_Latn but if you wish to return to such a sight again
eng_Latn he suggested an officer of cavalry turned gentleman farmer.
eng_Latn distrust yourself as well as him.
eng_Latn I do not want you to be grieved.
eng_Latn I am afraid I liked him none the better for that
eng_Latn I warn you so that you may be prepared.
eng_Latn for she had a great desire to see your worship.
eng_Latn That s terrible.
eng_Latn when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement.
eng_Latn she had run up to him and given herself up entirely, shy and happy.
eng_Latn commanding their service for twenty four hours
eng_Latn Of course! I think it's about timeyou had a night off, Ms Baboon.
eng_Latn And the whole world was a beach!
eng_Latn always lent them a sympathetic ear.
eng_Latn had suffered too much where he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.
eng_Latn Spies from the old ruined castleare everywhere!
eng_Latn every other thought was effaced, and he felt only a profound and unheard of joy.
eng_Latn he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed.
eng_Latn when over thirty four years of age
eng_Latn who was to approach him and how.
eng_Latn I glanced at the slide.
eng_Latn which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.
eng_Latn she was to attend him instantly
eng_Latn but everything was kept free of dust by a diligent hand.
eng_Latn but certainly not angry and scared.
eng_Latn brave without rashness
eng_Latn you wait 'til you hear this
eng_Latn even if he were hired by the hour
eng_Latn I didn't want to get sucked into it again.
eng_Latn he would have something to fight for, something to die for, if need be!
eng_Latn you went out in the hall and shouted for her.
eng_Latn yet was such good company
eng_Latn respectively called the first and second irons.
eng_Latn opening the door of a room
eng_Latn boiling him for a whole day over a slow fire
eng_Latn I've been moping in the house all day
eng_Latn A circle and a circle. A circle and a square. This wiggle and this squiggle. Bow-Wowzer, we are there!
eng_Latn I heard my breathing stop without feeling it.
eng_Latn it would be too rough for her tomorrow.
eng_Latn began to blubber out something about
eng_Latn in its place was only a wooden shelter
eng_Latn to clear up a difference that had arisen between them on a very important philosophical question.
eng_Latn when it was brightly lit and crowded with laughing guests.
eng_Latn ran the cold water on full, and then splatted cupped handfuls against her cheeks
eng_Latn landed with a thud in the field over the hedge.
eng_Latn to ask him what he had said.
eng_Latn I'm still here Dog, but I'm also somewhere else now.
eng_Latn I got home just after the others had left for school.
eng_Latn you can give me the maker's address, and tell him to have it ready for me.
eng_Latn I'll explain it, I'll explain all to you.
eng_Latn they renewed their eternal vows, and swore to write to each other every day
eng_Latn for there was quite enough water in it already
eng_Latn by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had been expended.
eng_Latn to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement
eng_Latn ornot well who could tell.
eng_Latn I may not marry you, either. I don't know.
eng_Latn perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence
eng_Latn then, the dungeon returned.
eng_Latn I know what's going on.
eng_Latn he answered, frowning.
eng_Latn his bedroom candle in his hand
eng_Latn but all she had to do was admit the possibility for it to be considered a reality.
eng_Latn but you can't expect me to have any manners
eng_Latn for she never walked again in public.
eng_Latn the country needed more intensive working of its land.
eng_Latn The Castle has a monster, though no one has ever seen it. But when they hear it...
eng_Latn if a hunted cat, surrounded and hard pressed, turns into a lion
eng_Latn walked to the centre of the terrace, and stood in front of the prince's chair.
eng_Latn that would hurt.
eng_Latn Imagine all the new customers you could have with a feline line of biscuits?
eng_Latn but I did not observe the air to be much colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I had stood under the shade of a mountain.
eng_Latn I've been here for an hour
eng_Latn I didn't mean to hurt you.
eng_Latn a cloud traversing the sky out of seasonsufficed to make a world crumble.
eng_Latn but not so completely as to understand what was the matter.
eng_Latn I am not altogether out of hopes, in some time, to suffer a neighbour _Yahoo_ in my company
eng_Latn that the cause of death had been the cyanide vapors activated in the tray by some photographic acid
eng_Latn never mind if the leak should double on her.
eng_Latn there must be a difference between master and man, between lord and lackey
eng_Latn he was not diminutive
eng_Latn but not badly enough to be in the mortal shadow
eng_Latn sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room
eng_Latn I wish I had never come here
eng_Latn he gave up thinking about it.
eng_Latn my secret ambition is to rid the world of evil
eng_Latn he obeyed her shout and was silent.
eng_Latn unless of course it involved punching somebody.
eng_Latn passed the bottle before he sat down again.
eng_Latn he gave him up for lost
eng_Latn I don't care if she is the only half vampire he's not related to.
eng_Latn they will be friends
eng_Latn he wandered off in the direction of his room
eng_Latn but, for my part, I was never much afraid of his vagaries.
eng_Latn limping most of the last five hundred miles on three legs
eng_Latn I shall be on the king's left and as I am the chief person threatened, remain at the coach door to the left.
eng_Latn who had more than any contributed to the death of my father,
eng_Latn because of having noted her several times during the precedingwinter.
eng_Latn this portrait was painted before that, when she was still unmarried.
eng_Latn she yelled, so loudly that he jumped.
eng_Latn the flying figure went towards the bath house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence.
eng_Latn read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old world narrative
eng_Latn We ve found bits of it.
eng_Latn but if you find
eng_Latn only think what a position we are in!
eng_Latn everybody knows that.
eng_Latn I feel that also, sir
eng_Latn before the morning were over
eng_Latn a reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock jaws upon him.
eng_Latn in her most civil tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.
eng_Latn never had he worked so hard.
eng_Latn I hope you know by those marks what young gentleman I mean.
eng_Latn I think you did really well
eng_Latn I am anxious about him and glad
eng_Latn they hardly heeded this detail.
eng_Latn I want to bake a cake but they re taking a bath in my cake tin!
eng_Latn had triumphed in the end.
eng_Latn in case he invited me, I would comply or otherwise.
eng_Latn he must be found
eng_Latn the circumstances were not.
eng_Latn rising above his defeat with a serene dignity.
eng_Latn she had an attack of hysterics.
eng_Latn He s not a giant or a bird or a fish.
eng_Latn they had sent out a TV reporter to do a story on her.
eng_Latn took her daughter onto her lap
eng_Latn still no answer.
eng_Latn while she toured all the way around him, taking her time and looking.
eng_Latn so that I thought
eng_Latn her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window
eng_Latn I shut her out viciously.
eng_Latn mostly because her brain was already on to something else.
eng_Latn there were scarcely six months between them.
eng_Latn I'm done with you forever.
eng_Latn looked slightly alarming
eng_Latn I mean, you didn't even tell me you were going to be on television.
eng_Latn sat so long after it
eng_Latn But best of all and most of all..
eng_Latn but awoke gradually and surely.
eng_Latn a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery.
eng_Latn did not endeavor to resist it.
eng_Latn as he was out of his senses.
eng_Latn each labeled with a name in minuscule writing.
eng_Latn I thought, 'they'll fly at each other.
eng_Latn ....blend into the background. I ma little shy you see.
eng_Latn the poor, motherless girl, never accompanied, with a careless father, who had thought only of making her learned.
eng_Latn had lately allowed himself to be put on the board of directors in his turn
eng_Latn I went to the cavern to get some, and found a rattlesnake in there.
eng_Latn Snarrrrk. Snark.
eng_Latn How curious.
eng_Latn a giant wave picked him up and shot him toward the beach at the speed of a catapult.
eng_Latn it moved my darling to tears.
eng_Latn I would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible.
eng_Latn I can keep dancing..I can..I can..
eng_Latn What an amazing adventure.
eng_Latn I'd still got plenty of money in the bank, nearly two hundred quid
eng_Latn then decided that there was but one thing to do lay the bundle aside
eng_Latn reminds me of what happened to a famous poet of our own day
eng_Latn to expect me to love by choice is idle.
eng_Latn I've such an idea for a cotillion!
eng_Latn drew my hanger, put it up again.
eng_Latn return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed.
eng_Latn I shook my head, and a cascade of white drifted out of my hair.
eng_Latn but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions.
eng_Latn I HAD led this life about a month
eng_Latn I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.
eng_Latn she walked round the room.
eng_Latn but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.
eng_Latn I know what was the trouble!
eng_Latn but in my love that was I.
eng_Latn I won't spend a farthing on him.
eng_Latn Yes. And if we want to get all the children in the world to sleep in one night we d better get cracking!
eng_Latn to show a generous mind
eng_Latn backed against the walls
eng_Latn with which he was not a little amused.
eng_Latn Please slow down Pug. I'm running out of puff.
eng_Latn I took advantage of the fire to cook them.
eng_Latn nearly gored me with his horn after I plucked his tail.
eng_Latn I missed my mother terribly.
eng_Latn Yip!/Whoooooa!
eng_Latn when he tripped headlong over something
eng_Latn I got up and went down the hill to the cove.
eng_Latn I take it he's got a thing for guns
eng_Latn the soft step of a deer dozens of feet away.
eng_Latn I did not quite know what for
eng_Latn Someone has done LOTS of inventing.
eng_Latn I've got to use one of these.
eng_Latn I just want you to say if you can
eng_Latn but the coachman's shout and the dull rumble in the covered entry.
eng_Latn I made several attempts to get out of their way
eng_Latn for the poor, if they are persons of virtue and good sense, have those who follow, honour, and uphold them, just as the rich have those who flatter and dance attendance on them.
eng_Latn but it was the kind of stiffness you know will work out with a little exercise.
eng_Latn it's in that clearing back there.
eng_Latn when you might have fainted and had a miscarriage.
eng_Latn who was commanded to shoot me dead if I attempted my liberty.
eng_Latn in her own house each of them may be a princess.
eng_Latn flounced out of the shop.
eng_Latn I shall always value the necklace, and it was very kind of you to give it me.
eng_Latn a stone door concealed in the wall slid open.
eng_Latn This is a book by...
eng_Latn I was looking for a job
eng_Latn so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified
eng_Latn it's a father's duty to give his sons a fine chance.
eng_Latn that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero.
eng_Latn knowing too well how easily the heart accustoms itself to comforts
eng_Latn at the cathedral door with that threatening aspect he has
eng_Latn their men disfranchised, their women insulted.
eng_Latn but I consider it my duty to let you know of it.
eng_Latn so that she could become accustomed to the idea that he was her guardian and no longer her lover.
eng_Latn Hello!
eng_Latn he has not once even thought that I'm a live woman who must have love.
eng_Latn but when the sentry on the landing thrust his head in to announce the arrival of a prisoner, he revived at once.
eng_Latn I can't possibly keep them.
eng_Latn to be as near living people as he could
eng_Latn given all the consequence she could wish for.
eng_Latn as if the compliment were purely formal.
eng_Latn I and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine shop open, without thinking.
eng_Latn that is because you don't care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do.
eng_Latn I thought you would come, father, so I put it in my bag.
eng_Latn though hardness, not gentleness, made him give little trouble.
eng_Latn this was why he threw her off balance.
eng_Latn even worse, with a man who was not.
eng_Latn slipped the bundle under his arm.
eng_Latn I could not make it out
eng_Latn lotions made with the subacetate of lead, and fomentations of oxycrat.
eng_Latn This is a book all about unusualanimals and it is called...
eng_Latn but it was clear that he looked upon death with horror.
eng_Latn all clad in ivy and hemp stained green
eng_Latn forget it and forgive!
eng_Latn with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.
eng_Latn she would provide a place for me to sail in.
eng_Latn his lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout
eng_Latn plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise.
eng_Latn I think I provided a very nice red herring, if I do say so myself.
eng_Latn although the king at that time had no design against his life.
eng_Latn it is far better to be feared than loved
eng_Latn so much was expressed in that one look
eng_Latn but he disliked them for their boorishness.
eng_Latn the whole army desired to do so.
eng_Latn I'll lose my job if I don't do it.
eng_Latn but he fell straight into it in the violent expression of his convictions.
eng_Latn I've been promoted
eng_Latn but so that it may be reflected in them all
eng_Latn that year had counted for thirty.
eng_Latn you'd have thought he'd just popped out of the ground.
eng_Latn I didn't recognize the male voice, fierce and deep
eng_Latn I find that more unsettling than his anger.
eng_Latn it recurred several times
eng_Latn hes out of his pain.
eng_Latn I was afraid I was going to have to go to the FBI about it.
eng_Latn the crime is that of your father, not yours
eng_Latn he recognized the boat at once.
eng_Latn fixing himself on this very superior family.
eng_Latn I enjoyed it much.
eng_Latn for I'll take my davy I should be rated
eng_Latn I am sorry this has happened
eng_Latn is sorry he had anything to do with me.
eng_Latn but, contrasted and compared with what the warrior undergoes
eng_Latn but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never.
eng_Latn it was remarkable that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
eng_Latn this is not a place to sleep in.
eng_Latn Look! Shooting stars!
eng_Latn the nickname, he said, was an inheritance from his respected father.
eng_Latn he staggered towards the door
eng_Latn then dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards
eng_Latn but now it was only too dear to him.
eng_Latn but whichwas as quickly closed again on all the earthly life he had everknown.
eng_Latn touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.
eng_Latn I'm against them
eng_Latn I ll get my accordion!
eng_Latn even going through the villages it was only necessary to putt along the sidewalks at walking speed.
eng_Latn every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us.
eng_Latn but his former dignity is sadly abridged.
eng_Latn again she was roused as usual by something incongruous.
eng_Latn the sea breeze had set in higher than usual.
eng_Latn then he threw his handkerchief on my lap
eng_Latn I ought to meet death on the same spot
eng_Latn I half filled it from the water bottle on the washstand.
eng_Latn but I was impatiently waiting for your arrival
eng_Latn exerting his strength he forced it open
eng_Latn I don't need bad dreams to scare me anymore.
eng_Latn later on he will be judged for the old crime.
eng_Latn consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow
eng_Latn for the rest of the happy result I am looking forward to
eng_Latn to feed them on board, I had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn.
eng_Latn because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out.
eng_Latn her husband was inwardly afflicted at it.
eng_Latn I doubt there is a single child in the entire school who has read that book
eng_Latn how I hate them
eng_Latn let her want to be kissed, first.
eng_Latn at any rate, make a great stir in the scientific world.
eng_Latn pondered a long time.
eng_Latn it warn't long after that till I was used to being where I was, and liked it
eng_Latn thereupon repeated several times the word _Yahoo_.
eng_Latn perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards.
eng_Latn but deliberating on how to spend forty thousand roubles of district council money,
eng_Latn I'm not one of those men who submit to uneasiness and worry without having the force of character to face them.
eng_Latn bent his eyes upon me, as if he would have burnt me up with them.
eng_Latn I should imagine he must have been rather startled.
eng_Latn I noticed that my bag of knitting had been moved.
eng_Latn she didn't react to the added weight.
eng_Latn the last sound I heard of him
eng_Latn said she, this is for that old fellow who goes to mass.
eng_Latn others had crammed them inside tight bags
eng_Latn none was even better than one.
eng_Latn I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.
eng_Latn he knew that his doom was sealed.
eng_Latn That is OK Pug.
eng_Latn before we are through you shall see for your selves.
eng_Latn but his presence would simplify matters.
eng_Latn he again seized his trumpet
eng_Latn for in good truth you see more clearly into my life than I do myself
eng_Latn surprise for you all
eng_Latn one has need of experience and discernment to distinguish these two kinds of gentlemen
eng_Latn but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin.
eng_Latn addressing the letter in a disguised hand.
eng_Latn it still wasn't enough to cover all his debts.
eng_Latn Why am I Pug and not Dog?
eng_Latn he wrapped it up tightly.
eng_Latn I kissed the dust at his feet in thought only
eng_Latn inquiring into details of the action and our losses.
eng_Latn the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right.
eng_Latn To be! To be! You must be in today s play. Never mind the history of Shakespearian theatre!
eng_Latn don't go burying yourself alive, or putting yourself where
eng_Latn made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger
eng_Latn that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time.
eng_Latn then lapse into darkness for a year or for ever.
eng_Latn I am very drunk and I intend to get still drunker before the evening's over.
eng_Latn as if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expression
eng_Latn the manner in which you have related this remarkable adventure
eng_Latn I think I'd better do the actual stealing
eng_Latn I felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set light to it
eng_Latn when I remember the promise I made.
eng_Latn without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform.
eng_Latn but not once did he look around or take his eyes from her.
eng_Latn she was still holding a plate heaped with chicken in aspic.
eng_Latn starbursts of gunshot wounds
eng_Latn but he felt that she was not nearly as narrow as he had feared.
eng_Latn that was courage.
eng_Latn whose inventor I am persuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention
eng_Latn but nothing more would come of it.
eng_Latn made it fast
eng_Latn An excellent idea, Pug.
eng_Latn Bless you Pug.
eng_Latn part of me thinking we should be quiet
eng_Latn he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water.
eng_Latn hurried her into his room
eng_Latn but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight.
eng_Latn I do want it.
eng_Latn glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside.
eng_Latn that everybody was heartily sick of them.
eng_Latn that the child would have grown up and have sinned
eng_Latn I met the victim this morning in high spirits.
eng_Latn she was, at once, so proud of him and devoted to him, yet so compassionate and sorry
eng_Latn between them gleamed blue infinity.
eng_Latn I'll think about her.
eng_Latn I have quite enough to do at the moment without trying to quash these ridiculous rumors.
eng_Latn her protest was not only nervous but vigorous.
eng_Latn said, he had orders from the captain to set me ashore.
eng_Latn which resembled a shed whichhad been converted into a house.
eng_Latn the littlebrown cloth parish cap on his head
eng_Latn It would begin with a B and I would hide it under a big pile of other things beginning with B.
eng_Latn kill a few people for charity I have no objection.
eng_Latn then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic.
eng_Latn it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone.
eng_Latn I noticed that but I didn't pay it any mind then.
eng_Latn my tastes led me to explore every part of the country round
eng_Latn if you eat it
eng_Latn until I saw it in the dying boy.
eng_Latn he's not a hero!
eng_Latn she loved him
eng_Latn I have to be among the men at night.
eng_Latn I wheeled it to his couch.
eng_Latn I glanced down at the shell again, rather taken aback.
eng_Latn plunged head first into the water.
eng_Latn I just like being by myself.
eng_Latn until after a while the door of the room opened softly, and the butler came in.
eng_Latn I waded ashore in great spirits
eng_Latn but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change.
eng_Latn That s what I call a moo landing!
eng_Latn I wish you'd let me mind my own business.
eng_Latn looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.
eng_Latn about half way out of the sea, so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element.
eng_Latn you and me'll go to sea again.
eng_Latn as they might perceive by his deeds and his words
eng_Latn I wished to put you on your guard.
eng_Latn I saw his mother and kissed her hand, too.
eng_Latn I love fast foooooooooodd!
eng_Latn I don't remember now, but I must have stood pale, facing him.
eng_Latn I'm not sure I would have had the persistence, the faith it took to save her.
eng_Latn I heard the soft, wet sound of the scalpel across her stomach.
eng_Latn he hid himself to weep.
eng_Latn I sighed as I thought of how I would have to choke it back up later.
eng_Latn but she was warmed, not by the story, but by him.
eng_Latn I'm sure he did all that anyone could.
eng_Latn for he was thinking of the miserable twenty five dollars left him from all his recent ghastly adventures.
eng_Latn as if she knocked its brains out
eng_Latn Bats all folks!
eng_Latn then caught the mother around the neck with the same hand, kissed her, and laughed.
eng_Latn to speak the first ship I sight
eng_Latn raised it over his head, ready to strike.
eng_Latn an innocent substitute for infidelity.
eng_Latn Mmmm... Thank you.
eng_Latn her second glance was at the dying man
eng_Latn when in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand.
eng_Latn When Dog read the book I wobbled and shook, blinked and then I was there!
eng_Latn it did become a bit depressing after a while.
eng_Latn gave them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself.
eng_Latn I left him climbing to the window
eng_Latn I mean that he warn't never in it.
eng_Latn all that he will need will be a wife to make it complete
eng_Latn I didn't waste much attention on it.
eng_Latn I did not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it.
eng_Latn who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony
eng_Latn to see to his horse.
eng_Latn I ve seen a cat without a grin, but never a grin without a cat!
eng_Latn I hope she won't.
eng_Latn her blood turning to ice water.
eng_Latn from the seat to the rack, to the exasperation of his fellow passengers, against whom he knocked
eng_Latn I do think the host ought to give the lead himself.
eng_Latn saying she had already wasted too much time with him.
eng_Latn even the poorest dressed better than five years ago surely
eng_Latn held over the tub while they poured cup after cup of kerosene over her head.
eng_Latn then he trod water for a while, thinking hard
eng_Latn an ass covered with gold looks better than a horse with a pack saddle.
eng_Latn the conversation at once passed to the new subject of the education of women.
eng_Latn Well, something IS saying a lot if only we could understand it.
eng_Latn I would have died before I betrayed them.
eng_Latn Not even a good clown. Now, I'm frightened of heights so my clown feet are staying on the ground. No more balancing! No more Great Splendina.
eng_Latn as if she, too, had suffered from that inexplicable feminine obtuseness
eng_Latn I put the phone away in my bag
eng_Latn I'm sorry you were kept waiting
eng_Latn or a little shuttlecock against two battledores,
eng_Latn the man said as he led her into the sittingroom where a large platinum blonde woman was gazing rapturously at the TV screen.
eng_Latn I b'lieve the nigger was crazy.
eng_Latn I had never seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so.
eng_Latn uddenly blazed up like an exploding pine knot and then subsided just as quickly.
eng_Latn or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter.
eng_Latn I did not give you my address with any intention of escaping from you.
eng_Latn And in the Spring it was covered in little flowers and looking forward to leaves again.
eng_Latn thinking of him directly.
eng_Latn one day, when she felt better, he tried to take her, leaning on his arm, for a walk round the garden.
eng_Latn hadn't been used to that sort of thing
eng_Latn when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us.
eng_Latn looked into the cabin.
eng_Latn it was a long time.
eng_Latn but I heard there was something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed.
eng_Latn he'd run away simultaneous, your worship
eng_Latn there is, doubtless, a part of your fortune your father could not refuse you?
eng_Latn she sat in silent expectation.
eng_Latn in tones of bewilderment, despair, resignation.
eng_Latn seal their lids shut so they cant possibly leak or slip off.
eng_Latn I will not look.. Err DOWN!
eng_Latn certainly no respectable relations.
eng_Latn in how far she was to blame for what had happened.
eng_Latn Cricket? So that s what thosest icks on the beach were - cricket stumps.
eng_Latn stopped, staring at the space large enough for two people
eng_Latn trying as far as possible to notice and
eng_Latn in spite of the fact that he had made such drastic resolutions in regard to
eng_Latn for it seems that a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable.
eng_Latn Can we walk home please?
eng_Latn for I know well enough, from the poor fellow's goodness and harmlessness
eng_Latn he'd wrecked something very big this time
eng_Latn I was drunk with it, with the scent of her.
eng_Latn but she did feel a momentary qualm.
eng_Latn but I hope it's really hurting him
eng_Latn There is no ice cream van Pug.
eng_Latn How wizard - a wizard!
eng_Latn with these words she broke away and hurried off.
eng_Latn for he was a quiet inoffensive prisoner happy in his folly and required no watching
eng_Latn blew a brown paper free of the pack
eng_Latn I do!
eng_Latn I'm not at liberty to discuss my patients.
eng_Latn even then they had to eat lunch in shifts.
eng_Latn thousands and thousands of feet above the ground
eng_Latn I'd never had to work at it.
eng_Latn sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable to complete the sentence
eng_Latn I saw her measuring the color in my face, the moisture in my eyes.
eng_Latn has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the matter.
eng_Latn I dare say the boy isn't too dainty to eat 'em
eng_Latn who was being revived by mediwizards with cups of potion.
eng_Latn that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away.
eng_Latn that on his death bed he resigned his favorite mistress and her daughter to my care
eng_Latn so my conscience was at ease. I came forward. .
eng_Latn I am the last person he spoke to before he left the wharf, you know.
eng_Latn a magic formula hidden in one of the three hundred fourteen letters of its fifty eight words
eng_Latn I'd made up my mind to do things well.
eng_Latn I don't know if I get more than just this one dance,
eng_Latn the drug stores and they tell me if this one won't work that none will.
eng_Latn but with all his pains he saddled his ass,
eng_Latn has succeeded in nothing but in giving him extravagant idle habits.
eng_Latn I came with father.
eng_Latn who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.
eng_Latn for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast in her majesty's right hand.
eng_Latn even if he has to bed them down in the stable.
eng_Latn she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.
eng_Latn would serve to make plain to all and at once that
eng_Latn lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter
eng_Latn I haven't enough to pay for a passport!
eng_Latn but a short time only had elapsed when a noise he heard behind him awoke him
eng_Latn turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal board.
eng_Latn I see that when I set my eyes on you
eng_Latn so I don't have to lie to get a job.
eng_Latn I must do something.
eng_Latn defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.
eng_Latn have a bath, get drunk and visit one of the town's brothels usually in that order.
eng_Latn I have narrated all this as best I could
eng_Latn I can't even organize one simple evening
eng_Latn that was the only way she could define his condition to herself.
eng_Latn I said at the time that the bodice should be cut longer, and made of two widths.
eng_Latn cash, and cash down, I mean?
eng_Latn he flung himself back on the bed, and dragged me down with him in his arms.
eng_Latn the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one.
eng_Latn grieving the more since he had put forward his own opinion with little confidence
eng_Latn that he had abandoned everything and not left the city
eng_Latn I hate to wait
eng_Latn a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings
eng_Latn but no doubt she had not heard him or had not grasped what he was saying.
eng_Latn I'll kill him.
eng_Latn how it had been magically expanded
eng_Latn it was obstinately unwilling to be content with less.
eng_Latn jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set closely together
eng_Latn Hmmm how curious... in a really good way.
eng_Latn the other half she could give to her own view of the subject.
eng_Latn a fierce blow jerked his head to one side.
eng_Latn but he mustn't catch it yet
eng_Latn it would not be long.
eng_Latn how once a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in the wood.
eng_Latn I look at him, puzzled.
eng_Latn that was meant to impress the rest of us and show that they didn't belong to the common herd.
eng_Latn I tell you she wasn't cold, when I stole it!
eng_Latn he'll look in your tent an' see if you got anything lef' to eat.
eng_Latn although it was impossible for me to conjecture what it meant
eng_Latn I was going to be sick.
eng_Latn we arrived at my city
eng_Latn I ventured to remind the good man of my own business also
eng_Latn I would bind them up and wash them with my own hands.
eng_Latn that those begun on the twenty fifth
eng_Latn Oh Think nothing of it.
eng_Latn was in another department.
eng_Latn I pushed the plate of food back towards her pizza, I realized wondering how best to begin.
eng_Latn called on all the haughtiness she had been born,
eng_Latn warmed by its only lights.
eng_Latn then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook,
eng_Latn the old mustached officer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber
eng_Latn the command to give him love.
eng_Latn I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.
eng_Latn just toddle up to the hospital wing
eng_Latn at last forced it to leap out of the boat.
eng_Latn worthy wife of such as I am!
eng_Latn assisted her into the buggy.
eng_Latn I wasn't in a very good mood
eng_Latn so these men with their wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been.
eng_Latn It's outrageous!
eng_Latn Dog loves Books!
eng_Latn he should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself
eng_Latn that if he should chance to meet her alone somewhere in the street, he would venture to speak to her.
eng_Latn I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself
eng_Latn I left the owner of the horse to sit in the study all the evening with the lamp lighted.
eng_Latn because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore castle deck.
eng_Latn I thought you were the one meant to provide answers.
eng_Latn four hundred upon the black, and won
eng_Latn I'll believe I'll get it.
eng_Latn her blood turning to ice water.
eng_Latn here is the door where the sentry stands.
eng_Latn so that I could storm away with my pride and indignation.
eng_Latn sitting up in his bed in spite of his plasters and the pain of his ribs
eng_Latn but generally they take care not to succeed.
eng_Latn they, too, sank without trace.
eng_Latn which I was too ashamed to touch.
eng_Latn I ran out to beg him not to kill her.
eng_Latn to be the most conscientious man in the world
eng_Latn followed his helpmate downstairs.
eng_Latn what could I expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me?
eng_Latn I thought it was rather a short name, yesterday, ' I confessed.
eng_Latn Out of our way,great big rock
eng_Latn that the monster had convinced him of this love.
eng_Latn I watched the grace of his advance, absorbing it with my new eyes.
eng_Latn I can tell him!
eng_Latn t'other hand to their eyes, walked slow and solemn over there
eng_Latn had a good cry.
eng_Latn W-w-what is that huge, hairy, hideous creature Dog?!!
eng_Latn since both his mother and father had so often emphasized that
eng_Latn I think he and your mother have not had sex in a long time
eng_Latn it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding.
eng_Latn I was attempting a new world record Dog. Balancing the most dog biscuits on my nose.
eng_Latn in the enormous mythic bed that was always ready for him
eng_Latn as she did
eng_Latn just for reassurance that I would continue to feel the warmth of the south.
eng_Latn I saw what happens when guys like you are in charge, you see.
eng_Latn And here we are!
eng_Latn where he will be staying for the next three days.
eng_Latn I wish you courage and success
eng_Latn I never thought.
eng_Latn to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.
eng_Latn I love being on my own. Away fromall the hustle and bustle, nattering and chattering.
eng_Latn coming out of his cabin who will furnish you with every particular
eng_Latn the pleasantest he had ever heard.
eng_Latn the message I give the world is I am a successful woman .
eng_Latn I allowed her to divert from her destined path
eng_Latn shortly entered one on the same plan, but superior in length and breadth.
eng_Latn apparently obstructed by something in front.
eng_Latn was stunned and outraged
eng_Latn here were no gibers, censurers, backbiters
eng_Latn for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before
eng_Latn they both turned away to hide their laughter
eng_Latn because I consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make
eng_Latn interest that I had never felt before!
eng_Latn I shook the little golden locket into his palm.
eng_Latn But there not...
eng_Latn I've lost the passwords!
eng_Latn Dog? Dog! I wandered off a bit now I can t wander back.
eng_Latn she tried to feel an interest in her own amendment
eng_Latn his terrible hot grin spot welded to his face
eng_Latn these last two years somiserably between these crushing walls.
eng_Latn the sound of the squire's shot not having reached him.
eng_Latn I glanced hurriedly at the door, like a guilty child.
eng_Latn I take it you did not conceal the fact from him.
eng_Latn if you had one.
eng_Latn for I am naturally a poor little
eng_Latn And a body like a dog.
eng_Latn because, to the natural feeling of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority
eng_Latn white hands meekly folded on his knees
eng_Latn this terrible situation arising now
eng_Latn I do not understand you
eng_Latn Do you like my snow dog Dog ?
eng_Latn he was, spoke.
eng_Latn so I had to dive and dive and dive all morning.
eng_Latn the outward bound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her.
eng_Latn Then you have come to the wrong castle I'm afraid. I had hoped you might be my friends. But when you hear the monster you will run away.
eng_Latn he followed up these words by bestowing a liberal bounty upon him.
eng_Latn they took the spade and the pick there.
eng_Latn I do! I do! she cried.
eng_Latn a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth with scorn
eng_Latn Oh Ho….Oh Look at me. I'm trip-trapping!
eng_Latn My own spaceship is very basic but it gets me back to Earth.
eng_Latn I could hear her heart, thumping unevenly.
eng_Latn I wasn't sure I knew.
eng_Latn she offered him the flowerpot.
eng_Latn it would be difficult to say
eng_Latn near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle.
eng_Latn then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there
eng_Latn she was convinced that in the end persistence would succeed.
eng_Latn that her sauce was good or the meat well cooked.
eng_Latn to be champions always ready for the defence of their prince and country, by their valour, conduct, and fidelity.
eng_Latn up the coachsteps, and into the coach
eng_Latn in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction
eng_Latn whereafter there befell what our party had foretold.
eng_Latn yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail.
eng_Latn a most worthy old man, and what dignity!
eng_Latn being indeed equipped for no other.
eng_Latn listening to their footsteps dying away.
eng_Latn I already told you about the werewolves, anyway.
eng_Latn who answered him.
eng_Latn hand over my basin and my pack saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.
eng_Latn I'm afraid I'm staying too long at your desk here, don't you think?
eng_Latn more to herself than to him.
eng_Latn I had now leisure to examine the purse.
eng_Latn till I knew them nearly by heart
eng_Latn his bearing, his gait, his dignity and imposing presence held me spellbound and wondering.
eng_Latn they are for my sister, who has quite a different complexion.
eng_Latn if an enemy, to bring them to naught
eng_Latn though this he did not admit to himself to punish her.
eng_Latn I'm ready Dog.
eng_Latn ask about some socks.
eng_Latn I'll keep trying, I promised, and then I dug in.
eng_Latn Happy Doggy Biscuit Day Dog!
eng_Latn I longed to see the ocean
eng_Latn carefully laid his sword and whip on the bed.
eng_Latn live at home with my wife and children.
eng_Latn she soon settled in her new abode
eng_Latn because it's not fair for me to want you here.
eng_Latn I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded.
eng_Latn were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance.
eng_Latn BOW-WOWZERRRRRRR!
eng_Latn where I was admitted to an audience
eng_Latn enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
eng_Latn as I sat there huddled on the floor.
eng_Latn but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four penny piece,
eng_Latn but never daring to go beyond her.
eng_Latn force some magic out of me
eng_Latn I ain' gwyne to len' no mo' money 'dout I see de security.
eng_Latn at the noise they all ran out.
eng_Latn we've got big plans for this money.
eng_Latn we stood there, each at his post
eng_Latn waited with sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.
eng_Latn I suppressed a sigh.
eng_Latn that no one else in the family ever h ad, not even the children when they were young.
eng_Latn though her husband has fifty thousand francs a year.
eng_Latn watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight.
eng_Latn This Pug has a ring around one eye.
eng_Latn why had he allowed that doctor to go!
eng_Latn I was just ' trying to get myself together.
eng_Latn I could almost wish you had shouted and shown a light.
eng_Latn seconds before that kid was found
eng_Latn he had entered there in 1796, for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread.
eng_Latn he was sane enough, after a fashion.
eng_Latn for an uncle of ours bought the estate and paid for it down
eng_Latn YOU know his tavern was all right
eng_Latn but he was no longer happy with his decision.
eng_Latn our ship felt a terrible shock
eng_Latn I jumped after him.
eng_Latn said the alchemist, echoing the words of the old king.
eng_Latn had to submit to the realities of a new time
eng_Latn looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.
eng_Latn I ll save you, Pug!
eng_Latn showed a countenance of abject terror
eng_Latn What?!
eng_Latn he helped her to get out of the carriage,
eng_Latn what the laughter was about, drowned all the rest with his heavy roar.
eng_Latn I'm not telling anyone what to do.
eng_Latn wind or no wind.
eng_Latn but the short flick of yellowish flame in the dusk was powerless against the muffled up mysteriousness of the dark figure with an invisible face concealed by a great sombrero.
eng_Latn all by his tongue, and his ape, and his show.
eng_Latn I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk.
eng_Latn love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul.
eng_Latn I smiled at the enthusiasm in his voice.
eng_Latn was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws.
eng_Latn 26. he is not proud and selfish nor ostentation
eng_Latn but suddenly composing himself, he fell on his knees
eng_Latn I howled in pain and fury and turned on him.
eng_Latn since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier.
eng_Latn a greasy smudge crossed his white brow.
eng_Latn And so we bid farewell to the wonderful world within our world and some mysteries which may never be solved.
eng_Latn I have no way out of this.
eng_Latn Fox Who Loves Words, would you like to join us on our quest?
eng_Latn were about twenty feet high at the base and six feet above the water at the tip.
eng_Latn of sending my seconds to you
eng_Latn I therefore hoped they would not treat me as an enemy
eng_Latn now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.
eng_Latn because it was not fastened.
eng_Latn so much so that I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you
eng_Latn then hoisting everything to her side, and stacking her canvas high up
eng_Latn Please draw some more Dog. I want to see what happens next!
eng_Latn looked into the cabin.
eng_Latn hang it, we don't want the small pox, you see.
eng_Latn why, if for being lovers they send people to the galleys
eng_Latn I've never yet wanted a woman bad enough to marry her.
eng_Latn so what it must have been like for you I cant imagine.
eng_Latn I don t like being surrounded bynature Granny Pug.
eng_Latn he asked sullenly.
eng_Latn I could force nothing on him
eng_Latn the slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed
eng_Latn so that he would help him start the total war.
eng_Latn I had a long think about it.
eng_Latn I think you'd all better go out to the playground and amuse yourselves until the next lesson.
eng_Latn I heard a loud fall in the parlour
eng_Latn I dont care.
eng_Latn Why?
eng_Latn yet his glance friendly and affectionate as it was expressed a sense of his own superiority.
eng_Latn he said to himself in despair
eng_Latn I only know that there was a conspiracy to rescue the king.
eng_Latn so I had to come back here and live in my toilet.
eng_Latn but it will be painful
eng_Latn but you can't pretend he's not careless.
eng_Latn it was entirely out of the question.
eng_Latn One should certainly hope so!
eng_Latn so you will excuse me if I don't let you off homework today.
eng_Latn I am in no fear of you.
eng_Latn also had it from his
eng_Latn I did it, she said, sounding pleased.
eng_Latn when some of the effects of the war had worn off
eng_Latn You read my mind Pug.
eng_Latn I mustn't! and holding on to the rails firmly, she waited.
eng_Latn she cried, and threw herself into his astounded arms.
eng_Latn Perhaps you could give Janice alittle push?
eng_Latn he said and went out, closing the door noiselessly behind him.
eng_Latn his brothers held him back and began to pinch him.
eng_Latn ANT (giggle) so ends another amazingadventure.
eng_Latn I was almost willing to become a believer, too.
eng_Latn said the old lady, laughing
eng_Latn when we said we wanted two.
eng_Latn they spoke of playing charades, but in my ignorance I did not understand the term.
eng_Latn I thought it as well to put one more question.
eng_Latn I asked, darkness seeping into my voice.
eng_Latn destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it should pretend to dispute his absolute commands.
eng_Latn were still hurrying to get dressed.
eng_Latn I mentioned to you yesterday what was the state of my affairs.
eng_Latn after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep
eng_Latn I'm fat, but I'm strong and healthy.
eng_Latn Don t worry Pug. Do you see that net?
eng_Latn put in very significantly and plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I am present.
eng_Latn unless indeed it is short enough to be said in two words.
eng_Latn come and kiss me there that's enough
eng_Latn as I had ample reason to know
eng_Latn how and where they might go be do from now on
eng_Latn I stopped my camel peaceably.
eng_Latn I declutched, trod on the foot brake
eng_Latn I say, we were so robbed,and hunted
eng_Latn I staked you out and let you see me from time to time I hoped your magic would respond to mine.
eng_Latn as a sensible physiologist, simply particularly re mark its front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness.
eng_Latn had secretly disobeyed it.
eng_Latn the fire was beautiful
eng_Latn calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation
eng_Latn Is someone having a party?
eng_Latn Perhaps we have a book in the shopthat will help you pass the time?
eng_Latn he said he knew how better than me and he did, too, because he's used to camping.
eng_Latn I've abandoned romanticism
eng_Latn I saw you doing it yesterday in the kitchen.
eng_Latn though I'm glad he's better in health, I'm sorry he's so much less pleasant, and so much less affectionate to me.
eng_Latn let us join them, and lay together our own.
eng_Latn The naughty bookshop mice.
eng_Latn but maybe it's taught you a lesson.
eng_Latn I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect
eng_Latn soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey.
eng_Latn this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am certain.
eng_Latn I am telling him to sell out at once before they drop any further.
eng_Latn his daughter that her life was very hard
eng_Latn No, but EAT MY DUST!
eng_Latn where he buried me alive.
eng_Latn pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves
eng_Latn but I do place him before you as a model for repentance.
eng_Latn two others were three and four years old.
eng_Latn I mean have you ever had any people work under you
eng_Latn we plan to yank 42 million dollars
eng_Latn I'd rather risk whatever could happen
eng_Latn but all people see is magic.
eng_Latn stroking me gently
eng_Latn without thinking beyond the immediate cause
eng_Latn if she does when she's talking to me.
eng_Latn You know my name.
eng_Latn there it remained
eng_Latn then all of a sudden there was an explosion of fire arms and a cry.
eng_Latn you'll not encourage my son to further disobedience.
eng_Latn I have let thee perish!
eng_Latn I had not left the house for years.
eng_Latn who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for the hand of his master
eng_Latn to make use of the expressionwhich all children will understand.
eng_Latn he removed his hat, let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow.
eng_Latn before the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her.
eng_Latn while the earth and sky were cool.
eng_Latn be not forgetful of prayer.
eng_Latn the world's better off without them in my opinion
eng_Latn only, well'm, you mout change yo' mind.
eng_Latn one might have imagined that he was expecting something very important to himself, and that he had decided to wait for it.
eng_Latn taking the frail wrist between his fingers, feeling for a pulse.
eng_Latn but it was evident that the last two years had been as hard on her as ten difficult ones.
eng_Latn more cotton than you ever saw.
eng_Latn but the word love threw her into revolt again.
eng_Latn I say this lest thou shouldst imagine
eng_Latn that, fortunately for her and for her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness
eng_Latn but as soon as her trembling arm left the bed
eng_Latn clyde, so completely overcome and swayed by his desire
eng_Latn he said I didn't need it to get out of prison with
eng_Latn however weak it may seem.
eng_Latn They like me being funny!
eng_Latn memories of his own terrible misery at school came flooding back to him.
eng_Latn You certainly work the biggest mouth. Those are my tyre tracks and I did everything!
eng_Latn the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right.
eng_Latn I really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you?
eng_Latn I'll do what has to be done, .
eng_Latn find out about this witness in the meantime.
eng_Latn to bend them the wrong way was intolerable.
eng_Latn I hoped she wasn't so dissatisfied that she would skip the questions I was waiting for.
eng_Latn I was asked to see her off.
eng_Latn my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer
eng_Latn that made me draw in my head so quickly for I was fearful he might also see me
eng_Latn replied the man
eng_Latn it was evident that he had not slept.
eng_Latn how much time they had left.
eng_Latn I was sick once typhoid.
eng_Latn all about it.
eng_Latn I set it down, private, because somebody might want ME to spell it next, and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it.
eng_Latn nevertheless, we started out with one hundred and fifty men and a huge train of empty pack camels for the spoils.
eng_Latn not because she felt alone, which in fact she was
eng_Latn dragged it back close to the wall
eng_Latn before he showed himself.
eng_Latn I ll play a tune and see what happens.
eng_Latn I wisht it could be all'nice.
eng_Latn but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him.
eng_Latn we'll have them tarred and feathered, and flung in the river!
eng_Latn she moaning and grieving all night long, though I screamed for vexation that I couldn't sleep.
eng_Latn but only singly and separate, and each one his own way
eng_Latn but I must pray for the dead.
eng_Latn is the more deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril.
eng_Latn but let us know, as nigh as possible, how much we have.
eng_Latn made a vague smile of gratitude
eng_Latn an uncommon beauty who needed only a beard to be hired by a circus.
eng_Latn but because he knew that the enemy was beaten
eng_Latn steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother's.
eng_Latn let me come and play some airs with you.
eng_Latn but though this arrangement was made between them
eng_Latn he wasn't fool enough to pick a fight right under a teacher's nose.
eng_Latn not because she felt alone, which in fact she was
eng_Latn I've run quite out of it.
eng_Latn it's in that clearing back there.
eng_Latn I don't want your advice.
eng_Latn I saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed
eng_Latn coming back to it over the last few days again and again, constantly surprised by the strong ache of sadness and nostalgia.
eng_Latn Umm Applications ... Celebrations..Aah. Constellations!
eng_Latn All this time I was lonely because a baby dragon was lonely too!
eng_Latn We ll soon have you feeling better Dog.
eng_Latn I came simply to help him and you.
eng_Latn something she had seen.
eng_Latn I said, he must come up.
eng_Latn I should throw myself into the water.
eng_Latn in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed.
eng_Latn I was wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.
eng_Latn A hill.
eng_Latn send me an owl if you find anything.
eng_Latn however, I refused, with expressions of the highest acknowledgment.
eng_Latn she gave him a clean diaper to bandage his head.
eng_Latn but they had only done it to keep her quiet.
eng_Latn sat down by it.
eng_Latn parents are not to settle children in life against their will.
eng_Latn wherever I may be I'll come to have one more talk with you
eng_Latn the convinced and earnest tone and look of the moralist who knows that he is right.
eng_Latn though I don'twant to go back in the hotel business either if I can help it.
eng_Latn as for instance, if it has two males
eng_Latn but by noon of the twentieth, she admitted it wasn't happening.
eng_Latn I never could entirely settle. whether it was a reality or a dream
eng_Latn followed her again.
eng_Latn Did. You. Know.... The largest wind-turbine in the world is twenty stories high.
eng_Latn I could distinguish the dapper shape and jaunty walk of the naturalist.
eng_Latn he would sooner or later get the opportunity which he desired.
eng_Latn you must prepare her
eng_Latn worse yet, to hate with touch of pity!
eng_Latn whoever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration to us.
eng_Latn I only say he is a nice man in his own way!
eng_Latn enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
eng_Latn then remained fixed, while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.
eng_Latn had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side
eng_Latn but in her own fashion.
eng_Latn by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn
eng_Latn he will feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin,
eng_Latn at the feet hanging down nervelessly, with their bare toes some six inches above the floor
eng_Latn putting on his spectacles he began reading.
eng_Latn let each one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own.
eng_Latn that, although many funerealspectres had crossed his path in life
eng_Latn but because of his overwhelming astonishment that anyone knew his secret.
eng_Latn but it was rust eaten and battered.
eng_Latn I like a healthy breeze round my privates, thanks.
eng_Latn I needed no more confirmation of what she carried in her womb.
eng_Latn I felt stunned and shaken.
eng_Latn neither could I possibly guess the meaning, till my tutor informed me.
eng_Latn on landing that state contract.
eng_Latn very conscious of your exclusiveness.
eng_Latn left a piece of wing in a nearby tree
eng_Latn nobody could be!
eng_Latn her daughter should be married there
eng_Latn Scary is what they do best. They have jaws that bite and claws that catch and - THERE S ONE!
eng_Latn Whatever is the matter Pug?
eng_Latn I read the note
eng_Latn as you are a gentleman, burn this letter
eng_Latn spurred after his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on
eng_Latn And anytime everything is getting too much for you, you can close your eyes and visit it again.
eng_Latn he simply formed an unfavorable opinion of the banker's constitution
eng_Latn he's all you have akin in the wide world, that you will ever know remember.
eng_Latn how much it has cost me to say the first word.
eng_Latn I was never in my life so terribly frightened.
eng_Latn I feared for a time he might be otherwise.
eng_Latn as she was weak and erring.
eng_Latn following a path it obviously knew.
eng_Latn when the others came back from looking for her,
eng_Latn that would make the boy violently sick.
eng_Latn I can see you Pug.
eng_Latn they're so thin skinned and chicken hearted.
eng_Latn rekindle the fire.
eng_Latn so had the chance for which he had waited.
eng_Latn the witness must have seen that?
eng_Latn I have done nothing wrong.
eng_Latn but it's best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.
eng_Latn I needn't tell you to be secret.
eng_Latn I've been putting out fires all week.
eng_Latn clear you too quite from my reach and hearing.
eng_Latn even though it is stolen.
eng_Latn when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too.
eng_Latn but so ready to refuse the social obligations which went with them
eng_Latn he concluded that he was dead and that those in the room were his murderers
eng_Latn as I had dreamed, just like the feeling for my child.
eng_Latn that was all that was to be said and all he had any business to know.
eng_Latn how much I may feel on my own account.
eng_Latn was no roof at all.
eng_Latn I was concerned that I might have to avenge your murder.
eng_Latn I'll never be ready.
eng_Latn but the arrow fell back foiled by his hidden coat of mail.
eng_Latn I wondered why he was making such a fuss.
eng_Latn a man's demanding voice squawked from the phone on her desk.
eng_Latn if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book.
eng_Latn fight his way out, and elope with her.
eng_Latn before thegates of the cemetery are closed.
eng_Latn A bath, Dog.
eng_Latn What are they talking about?
eng_Latn I was most anxious to see you
eng_Latn I gazed steadily at my plate.
eng_Latn replied the man
eng_Latn I'm glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us.
eng_Latn but it was done, and I went quickly back to the dining room and reseated myself at the dinner table.
eng_Latn changed him into a stranger in the end.
eng_Latn that he should with his family take a share of the profits of the cattle yard
eng_Latn but you would sell yourself to a man you didn't love
eng_Latn all that I do not wish to remember.
eng_Latn there was too much work for one woman.
eng_Latn fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it
eng_Latn live to be happy yourself
eng_Latn I don't want to freak her out.
eng_Latn I tried to tell you folks, he said.
eng_Latn I have a mind too!
eng_Latn go again tomorrow and make haste, leave everything and make haste.
eng_Latn went on sawing his wood.
eng_Latn But I'm having such fun.
eng_Latn I wish you courage and success
eng_Latn That is my new favourite book!
eng_Latn a still greater number who, chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely
eng_Latn she was almost dressed, and her packing almost finished.
eng_Latn if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise
eng_Latn give me your hand and let me press it gently
eng_Latn they were on not so intimate terms.
eng_Latn excellent spirits, and that keen, intellectual mood which with him always accompanied violent physical exertion.
eng_Latn if you'll let me b'long to the gang
eng_Latn he had committed in pursuing and eventually allowing him self to fail into this unhallowed relationship with her
eng_Latn because she no longer had time or patience to do it herself.
eng_Latn arose the figure of a man wrapped in a poncho up to the neck.
eng_Latn appeared to abash the boy
eng_Latn It was supposed to be my magicwand.
eng_Latn but mainly because he was her parent.
eng_Latn deserted from the front
eng_Latn I do need the money so badly.
eng_Latn already getting ready to change back again.
eng_Latn she knew their habits and weaknesses, and where the shoe pinched each one of them.
eng_Latn though there's many a common man would say better what he meant.
eng_Latn I honestly had it all planned.
eng_Latn I know you haven't done anything to me personally.
eng_Latn I howled in pain and fury and turned on him.
eng_Latn but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept
eng_Latn then let me die.
eng_Latn extorting almost as much outward homage
eng_Latn then fifteen hundred francs, all with equal readiness.
eng_Latn then the brother, he, who had appeared so attached to you!
eng_Latn he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.
eng_Latn I had been positioned over her life like the blade of a guillotine.
eng_Latn so that they would not leave any trace or meet any people they knew.
eng_Latn when he showed his nose in a shop
eng_Latn that in most people's estimation, to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly.
eng_Latn I will throw up everything and fly to you
eng_Latn I won't go before seventeen, anyway.
eng_Latn was one with the babe whom she had loved
eng_Latn but how about me?
eng_Latn Dog, I really think I saw a something over there!
eng_Latn show it was no mere irresponsible venture of his hand
eng_Latn have time to see it leap upward out of the sand before it blew him in half.
eng_Latn What kind of a thing Pug?
eng_Latn whom she wanted as a second witness.
eng_Latn you wait 'til you hear this
eng_Latn their building of this new house,planned to comfort them through a happy old age
eng_Latn the jailer entered and placed the bread on the table
eng_Latn to drop off their bags before dinner.
eng_Latn monsters aren't as bad as they're made out
eng_Latn I bet it is.
eng_Latn but now tell me, who was the first tumbler in the world?
eng_Latn in which theexpression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration.
eng_Latn I forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound.
eng_Latn the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up.
eng_Latn the joint was swollen rather
eng_Latn We are extremely hungry pandas and this is our very last bamboo leaf.
eng_Latn but it goes down the wrong way and I start coughing.
eng_Latn making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld, when they parted.
eng_Latn Yes Dog, but I'm having trouble YIP!
eng_Latn Please can we read a different story Dog?
eng_Latn the only requirement being that we do not disturb others we are not supposed to entertain on a large scale.
eng_Latn but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room
eng_Latn grasped one of the tufty plants firmly
eng_Latn turned again to his sister and whispered
eng_Latn When he found himself at the height of his power and security inaccessible to the mortal conspirators, he suddenly and irrationally felt a wave of self-confidence in him.
eng_Latn I mean, even the places where no guys are locked up, it smells pissy.
eng_Latn for that malicious reprobate, having often endeavoured in vain to persuade both the captains that I might be thrown into the sea
eng_Latn let's check how yeh've done!
eng_Latn consisting of his wife and three grown up daughters.
eng_Latn the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching him.
eng_Latn Camille is so good at hiding. Itmight take us some time to find her.
eng_Latn This is an anthology Pug. A Book full of Exciting Tales.
eng_Latn And the prize is...?
eng_Latn but she looked down on the ground and began to cry.
eng_Latn This is a book about building and fixing things, Pug. And it is called -
eng_Latn so that the children had no standard of economy
eng_Latn but the laugh on his lips froze in wonder.
eng_Latn I pushed the basket of bread toward her.
eng_Latn at this the bailiff simply expressed a profound despondency, and offered no definite opinion,
eng_Latn the more grace a girl got in her
eng_Latn I make a snap decision.
eng_Latn I shook my head vigorously.
eng_Latn though ten thousand roubles is a capital thing to have on occasion.
eng_Latn passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers
eng_Latn I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond the village, and I'd planned to do it at five o'clock in the morning.
eng_Latn I soon forgot storm in music.
eng_Latn or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands!
eng_Latn I looked down upon the servants, and one or two friends who were in the house
eng_Latn cold as marble and proud like his father
eng_Latn Kennels.. Kenya..Ah. Camping!
eng_Latn he saw himself becoming governorof the state.
eng_Latn not a waffle or zigzag pattern but groups of circles and lines
eng_Latn Queen Victoria?
eng_Latn he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business
eng_Latn he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.
eng_Latn she endeavoured not to be uneasy
eng_Latn then to go cosily to bed.
eng_Latn she had become very serious
eng_Latn more effectively than a rampaging rhino.
eng_Latn which he will not do
eng_Latn you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by a different conduct
eng_Latn because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound
eng_Latn proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.
eng_Latn like our music paper.
eng_Latn wherever possible roofs had been dispensed with.
eng_Latn for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is.
eng_Latn leave their women and children unprotected.
eng_Latn I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my throat.
eng_Latn I think I'm going to last at least five years longer.
eng_Latn I was not going to be nervous and shy with the servants any more.
eng_Latn I'm sure I'm not doing this the way you expect.
eng_Latn so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is much less.
eng_Latn so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road.
eng_Latn informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.
eng_Latn he has opened an account with my house for his son
eng_Latn though in vinter, ve have very little daylight, so ve are not enjoying them.
eng_Latn came and pressed them both to see an execution
eng_Latn you mun'n't go on so.
eng_Latn a couple of sun perch
eng_Latn I'm going to have to call it off.
eng_Latn Check my moves.
eng_Latn to day I saw him pass, and he had a gun on his arm.
eng_Latn that I began to think I should be obliged to ring the bell.
eng_Latn you will let me take my life into my own hands
eng_Latn as a well meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.
eng_Latn look at my brothers.
eng_Latn I asked you here to help.
eng_Latn but I didn't give much heed to it.
eng_Latn he calling me all sorts of names for the base spirit I evinced.
eng_Latn Well ... that seems to be a success-
eng_Latn I think it is time to face our own scary something.
eng_Latn he had a hard job shaking it off
eng_Latn mention it, maybe, so as to offset the look of its being hidden
eng_Latn for a price, provide him with some worth while prescription or information.
eng_Latn which I consider quite beneath me.
eng_Latn so that he could tell her no, that everything was over
eng_Latn half of it at least by right belonged to you
eng_Latn the landscape frozen into a colorless diorama devoid of life.
eng_Latn saying he was wanted at the counting house.
eng_Latn that the forlorn head might perhaps have been lying on her lap.
eng_Latn I wish to thank you in advance.
eng_Latn I must tell you something.
eng_Latn she humanely pointed out the door.
eng_Latn in law, had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.
eng_Latn broke the bell rope, called for the servant with all her might
eng_Latn And inside...
eng_Latn it is simply owing to the fact that she has historically developed this force both in beasts and in men.
eng_Latn I won't keep you long, I won't even take off my coat.
eng_Latn flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse.
eng_Latn he looked up with the eyes of a tortured animal.
eng_Latn get on as well as we can
eng_Latn she suddenly recovered herself, and began to cry
eng_Latn I imagine we'll find another roadblock on the other end.
eng_Latn But what does it mean?
