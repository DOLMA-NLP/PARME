هەشتەهاش جە دەس دا	she lost her appetite	He put it just here.
ئاخرشەو، بێ واتەی کەلیمیە	finally without saying a word	I said, it didn't say a word.
زەنگەکە ڕایە تەری دریانە	the bell rang once more	the bells ringing as they passed.
ئاڐ کۆمیاوە سەرش و دیش کە ئاڐە وتێنە	he bent over her and saw that she was asleep.	"He put his hand over her, and said, ""Joe""."
تەنیا ڕام ئانە بێ کە زاڵ بوو ملوو وێمەرە	I just had to get over myself.	I merely hope he doesn't try to fuck me up.
سەرەش نیان سەروو شانەو شووە تێر بیەکەیشەو	her head on the shoulder of her satiated husband.	He put his feet together with his fingers.
دیش کە ئاڐێ یەکڕایی شکەشا کەردەو و چەودمای واق مەنەیرە	he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.	which had reached the height of his unusual unusual sanctity.
گردوو نۆکەرەکاش واق مەنێبێنێرە	all his attendants were in the same state of amazement.	his arrival made him smile and kissed him.
گاهەز تاوو کەشتیەکەی گێڵنوو وە پەی ساحیوەکەیش	I might return the vessel to her captain.	shipwrecked and abandoned in the sea.
فکر نەکەرێناوە چیگەنە وینووت بۆنەو ئانەیوە کەمیە پەشێویانێ	but I so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me	not thinking beyond the immediate cause, but rather that it was simply because he had seen her.
بە جۆریە سەیر و سەمەرە مارکەوتەرە سەر و زەمینی	miraculously the snake slumped to the floor	he looked up and down, with his eyes fixed on the ground.
ئەڐاش دوێ کەڕەتێ یاردیش دا	his mother helped him out twice	which he did with helpless hatefully.
بە یەکڕایی فکریە ئاما مەژگشەرە	when suddenly the idea occurred to him	he made signals with unity of thought.
وەلێ ئاڐە کەم قوێ بێ پەی جوڵیایوە	but she was too weak to move.	but there was a little work of no movement.
وەڵترەری فرەتەر جە چیویە بێ کە قەرار بێ هۆرش گێرۆ	was already more than she was meant to carry.	But there was a lot of exciting things that he had to get up early the next morning.
فکرش کەرد کە خاستەرەن چیویە نەواچۆ و بۆنەو ئینەیوە گرد چێوش حاشا کەرد	he thought it best to say nothing and so for the timebeing had denied everything	because it seemed to himthat it was simply because he hadn't spoken before, that he had reached the height of his unusual sanctity.
بازدێ با مۆڵەتش دریۆ کە سەروو ژیوای، ئازادی و سامان و مەردمیرە زاڵ بۆ!	let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people!	he said with the permission of his mother, who was going away, and who was going away.
خۆزگەی زانایام قەرارەن چە ئێحساسیەم بۆ	I wished I knew what I was supposed to be feeling.	I know just exactly how you feel.
ئا پیا کە بە تازەیی لوا چانەی مشۆ کە شۆخ بۆ	that is, the gentleman who has just gone appears to have an immoderate sense of humour.	The man who had just reached the height of his unusual sanctity.
عانیە لوایمێ گرد و ئا چێواشە پەی شی کەرداوە	all of which he explained to me as we went along.	so profound was the sensation that
ئەگەر زوو نەیاوایا ئاگە، جلەکاش پیس کەرێ	if she didn't get there soon she was going to stain her dress.	if he doesn't get a few steps towards it, it reallyworks a dream.
سەرەم تەکان داو وەروو لەرزای وێم بۆنەو ئانەیوە کە ئارۆ فرەش نەمەنەبێ دێر کەروو، گێرت	I shook my head and repressed a shudder at the thought of how close I had been to being too late today.	I shook my head with stress at the moment I couldn't bear to talk to him again.
من بێ تۆ نەتاوێنا ئینیشا گردی ویاروو	I I just couldn't have gone through all this without you.	I couldn't stand sitting on it without you.
دەنگشەرە دیار بێ کە هۆشش هەن پوەشە	his voice promised that he would take care of her	it seemed to himthat he was quite at home.
نیشانە مڐۆ کە دوانزە سەرئاشپەزێ ماتڵ و دەسوور و ئاڐێ نێ	implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.	It will remain in the body until he reaches the height of his unusual sanctity.
ئەڐام کە هۆشش بێ، ڕیک ژنەوتش و بە ناڕاحەتیوە هوشیارە بێ	which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.	I made my pants carefully and put them between her fingers.
من لوێنا پەی لایش و گرد لایەوە چەنیش بێنا	I'd have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere.	I leaned my head against the cold tea and leaned my head against the cold tea.
بە یەکڕایی تەقەو چێر و بەرەی ئاما	when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.	they stood and consulted.
جە حاڵیەنە کە سەر و سینەو بابەیشە و پاڵ کەوتێبێ، بە جوڵەو سەرەی واتش بەڵێ	but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father's breast	From the moment he reached the height of his unusual sanctity, he said with emphatic insistence.
چۆرچەمش یەکجار ئارام بێ	his face was quite composed.	I made my pants carefully and put them in the drawer.
چوون شۆنەو ونێ دیار بێ	for there was traces of blood	because they had reached the height of their unusual sanctity.

شۆنیشەرە ئێ و ئاواتێش بە تەمامی بە دی ئارێ	she would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly.	she knew about it and wanted it to last forever.
مدرابێرە و بە وردی چەمش بڕیەبێ ئی سەرەیە	so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.	he was sober, and he made an emphatic decision.
کەمیە چەولاتەرەو ماتڵ بی	but lingered at a little distance	was a bit nervous and happy.
ئی کەلیما و واتەی ئاڐیشا، ئا چێوە کە گەرەکش بێ واچۆ، واچێ	that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say	This, and the words of Mrs. Smith, went unnoticed.
ئاواتوازەنا دلی بووڵێنە کەمیە تڵات ئێستەبۆوە	let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes.	he was willing to give it to the poor man, who was impatiently there.
هەم دووبارە ئاڐەم جیا ئاستە، ئاڐەیچ بە شێویە ناحەز پەشتەو بەرەکەیش وست	I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.	I'm running a fever, and it hurts so much.
هەمیشە چاگەنە بێ، سەر و مێزیە میقلەیوە	which was always there, upon a little table	He's always been on that side of the table.
گۆچانەکێش ئاردە بەرەو کە بە شێویە سێحراوی بەرەکەی قوڵف کەرۆ	took out his wand to magically lock it.	she thought of tearing it apart with magical insistence.
واڵەکێش پەی کۆگەی لوابێ و چکۆنە	as to where she had gone or was now.	He put his words in the drawer and put them in the drawer.
جە زەخم و لەگەنیش کۆم بێ	so bent was he by the wound in his hip.	I'm running a fever and maybe a fox.
من ئا کەسەنا کە خراو جۆریە بێ ملاحێزە بیەنا	I'm the one who was horribly careless.	I'm not the kind of person who deserves this blessing.
هۆشش شیەبێوە ئا ئەسەرە کە وەڵتەر سەرشەو نیابێشەرە	but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days.	she was relieved he wasn't there.
زوو جیاش ئاستێ و لوا دلێ ئۆتاقەکەیش تا چێوەکاش هۆر گێرۆ	but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things.	He quickly reached the height of his unusual sanctity.
فکرش کەردەو کە چننە سەختەن کە ئەڐاو بابە زیندێ با وەلێ نەشناساش	he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you.	because she felt him wince that she was not her new coward.
بە ئێحترام و موحێبەتەو تێکەڵ بیەبێ	was tempered with respect and affection.	mixed up with respect and love.
واتش پەنە خەڵک یاردی بابەیەت دانشا و لواینێ شۆنەو شوەکەیتەرە	told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.	so that the whole thing went back the way to the drawing room.
مژە گێرتەبێشەرە و تەنیاییە گول کە نەتاوێ چەنەس بەر بشۆ زاڵ بیەبێ سەرشەرە	it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.	but he was so worn out and alone that he could not, owing to his mother's help.
وەختیە دیشا چننە جە فکرە شێتانەکاش حەز کەرۆ	when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas	I'd like to think of that again, if you had anything to say to him.
پسەو کەسیە کە بە قسەکەردەی عادەتش نیەن	as one unaccustomed to speaking	He's a man with a mind full of iron and steel and steel and steel.
بە دڵنیایی وە عەجیبتەرین چێو بێ	would certainly have been a most astonishing object	I'm sure it was a nice day for you.

ڕووبە دما گنۆ ملوو سەننەڵیەکەیشەرە	falling back in his chair	I made my pants carefully and put them between her fingers.
وەختیە باشیش کەردە پۆرەشەرە، هەستیە وەشش دی دلێشەنە کە کەستەر نەبێش	yet when she put her arms around him she could sense a faint echo of some intensity quite missing in the others.	Because there was no longer any old-fashioned firmness in her feelings.
یەکڕا زەربیە تێژ واردش بە پەشتیم و هۆرگێلانێوە	when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round	I made my pants carefully and put them between my fingers.
