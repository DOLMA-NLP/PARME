قسیەیەگ نەیاشتن کە وەلیفەت ژنەفتن داشتێت	had nothing to say that could be worth hearing,	They didn't happen to say that she was a lady.
بەشکەم لە جێ دزە وەو دەسەو بیەنەی پێمان	maybe he'll turn the thief over to us.	I put my fingers between her fingers, and put them between her fingers.
حوکمەن شەکەتن و ئەخوازن بخەفن	I expect you're feeling ready for bed.	They're gonna beat him up and embrace him like a bullfrog.

وە دودڵییەو ڕوونسم لە جومڵەگە	I finished hesitantly.	I look up blearily.
نەوەتۊ مێواندارە کەی بیەتە شوونێ	but she did not send a message for anyone to come for her.	she could not, owing to her mother's insistence.
یەیگەز کەفتمە بیر شەشتیرەم	the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind.	I merely had the intelligence from my mother.
وەلێ بێلن وەی مەسەلە جوور چاڵشێ تەماشا بکەیمن	but let's look upon it as a challenge.	but let me know, it hurts so much.
ئەڕەی یە کە ها تێ بکوژێتەم	for he'd kill me for nothing at all.	That's where I'm going.

ڕووژێ دۊیای ئەوە وە سەرئێشییەو ئەڵسیام	the next morning I woke up with a worse head than ever.	I put it just here, and put it between my bed and his.
ئەڵسیام و دەر ئوتاقە نام	I stood up and shut my bedroom door.	I shut my eyes, and I came out of the room.

ئمجا سابوونە کردە ناو ئاو	then he dipped the soap in the water	so that he put his foot down.
هەناس دا و چەوزاق کردە لێم	she breathed, and her gaze flickered to me.	she took her breath and stared at me.
وتووێژێ بێمانێ و قیقی خەنسن	there was a scraping of chairs, a babble of conversation, and laughter.	there was a moment of silence for him.
ها تێ سواڵێ ئەلێم بپرسن کە نتوانم جواوێ بیەم	you might ask me something that I should not be able to answer	I've been through this before, and I can't hold back.
لە پلە چۊم ئەو بان و دەر ئاپارتمانە ئەوکردم	I float up the stairs and unlock the door of our flat.	I called him a beggar, and he come to us.
