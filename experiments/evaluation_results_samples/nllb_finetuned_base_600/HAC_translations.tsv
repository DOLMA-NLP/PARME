ئەگەر زوو نەیاوایا ئاگە، جلەکاش پیس کەرێ	if she didn't get there soon she was going to stain her dress.	If he doesn't come home, he will get his clothes dirty.

چۆرچەمش یەکجار ئارام بێ	his face was quite composed.	Suddenly, his eyes calmed.

ئی کەلیما و واتەی ئاڐیشا، ئا چێوە کە گەرەکش بێ واچۆ، واچێ	that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say	so insidious was the sensation that whatever might be the proper thing for him to express himself.
ئاواتوازەنا دلی بووڵێنە کەمیە تڵات ئێستەبۆوە	let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes.	They wanted to have a few bottoms of green tea.
هەم دووبارە ئاڐەم جیا ئاستە، ئاڐەیچ بە شێویە ناحەز پەشتەو بەرەکەیش وست	I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.	He's standing by his back again, unwillingly.

واتش پەنە خەڵک یاردی بابەیەت دانشا و لواینێ شۆنەو شوەکەیتەرە	told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.	It's like they're helping the school and lending a massive attack.
