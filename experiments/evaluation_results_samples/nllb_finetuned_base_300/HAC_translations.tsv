تەنیا ڕام ئانە بێ کە زاڵ بوو ملوو وێمەرە	I just had to get over myself.	I'm just trying to keep my mouth shut.
سەرەش نیان سەروو شانەو شووە تێر بیەکەیشەو	her head on the shoulder of her satiated husband.	she put her head over her shoulder.
دیش کە ئاڐێ یەکڕایی شکەشا کەردەو و چەودمای واق مەنەیرە	he saw a sudden doubt in them, and then astonishment.	he saw that he had broken his unity and that there was no truth to it.
گردوو نۆکەرەکاش واق مەنێبێنێرە	all his attendants were in the same state of amazement.	And he's not really here.
گاهەز تاوو کەشتیەکەی گێڵنوو وە پەی ساحیوەکەیش	I might return the vessel to her captain.	so that he left the ship on the shore.
فکر نەکەرێناوە چیگەنە وینووت بۆنەو ئانەیوە کەمیە پەشێویانێ	but I so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me	He hadn't thought about what he'd seen, and he's very small.
بە جۆریە سەیر و سەمەرە مارکەوتەرە سەر و زەمینی	miraculously the snake slumped to the floor	in a curious way.
ئەڐاش دوێ کەڕەتێ یاردیش دا	his mother helped him out twice	He's been there for two hours.
بە یەکڕایی فکریە ئاما مەژگشەرە	when suddenly the idea occurred to him	I don't mean to think about it.
وەلێ ئاڐە کەم قوێ بێ پەی جوڵیایوە	but she was too weak to move.	But it's a little bit unmotivated.
وەڵترەری فرەتەر جە چیویە بێ کە قەرار بێ هۆرش گێرۆ	was already more than she was meant to carry.	There's more to it than that.
فکرش کەرد کە خاستەرەن چیویە نەواچۆ و بۆنەو ئینەیوە گرد چێوش حاشا کەرد	he thought it best to say nothing and so for the timebeing had denied everything	he thought it was because he hadn't noticed it, and that he'd lost sight of it.
بازدێ با مۆڵەتش دریۆ کە سەروو ژیوای، ئازادی و سامان و مەردمیرە زاڵ بۆ!	let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people!	for whom he has a right to life, liberty, property, and dignity.
خۆزگەی زانایام قەرارەن چە ئێحساسیەم بۆ	I wished I knew what I was supposed to be feeling.	I'm hoping you'll teach me how to feel about it.
ئا پیا کە بە تازەیی لوا چانەی مشۆ کە شۆخ بۆ	that is, the gentleman who has just gone appears to have an immoderate sense of humour.	for whom he has washed his feet.
عانیە لوایمێ گرد و ئا چێواشە پەی شی کەرداوە	all of which he explained to me as we went along.	he went to the hill, and stared at it.
ئەگەر زوو نەیاوایا ئاگە، جلەکاش پیس کەرێ	if she didn't get there soon she was going to stain her dress.	If he doesn't wake up soon, he's going to get his clothes dirty.
سەرەم تەکان داو وەروو لەرزای وێم بۆنەو ئانەیوە کە ئارۆ فرەش نەمەنەبێ دێر کەروو، گێرت	I shook my head and repressed a shudder at the thought of how close I had been to being too late today.	I'm afraid I'm afraid I'm not going anywhere.
من بێ تۆ نەتاوێنا ئینیشا گردی ویاروو	I I just couldn't have gone through all this without you.	I couldn't do it without you.
دەنگشەرە دیار بێ کە هۆشش هەن پوەشە	his voice promised that he would take care of her	It's obvious that he's sober.
نیشانە مڐۆ کە دوانزە سەرئاشپەزێ ماتڵ و دەسوور و ئاڐێ نێ	implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.	It's a sign that there's more than a dozen people in the room.
ئەڐام کە هۆشش بێ، ڕیک ژنەوتش و بە ناڕاحەتیوە هوشیارە بێ	which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.	I'm telling you, he's sober, and he's sick of it.
من لوێنا پەی لایش و گرد لایەوە چەنیش بێنا	I'd have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere.	I've seen her face and her face.
بە یەکڕایی تەقەو چێر و بەرەی ئاما	when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.	with one eye to the other.
جە حاڵیەنە کە سەر و سینەو بابەیشە و پاڵ کەوتێبێ، بە جوڵەو سەرەی واتش بەڵێ	but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father's breast	when he saw that he had fallen to his knees and to his knees, he nodded his head.
چۆرچەمش یەکجار ئارام بێ	his face was quite composed.	I'll see you're at ease.
چوون شۆنەو ونێ دیار بێ	for there was traces of blood	Because he's out of sight.
من چیویەم پەی واتەی بە شمە هەن	I have something to tell you.	I don't know what it means to you.
شۆنیشەرە ئێ و ئاواتێش بە تەمامی بە دی ئارێ	she would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly.	I've heard of it and I've always wanted to see it.
مدرابێرە و بە وردی چەمش بڕیەبێ ئی سەرەیە	so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.	carefully and carefully.
کەمیە چەولاتەرەو ماتڵ بی	but lingered at a little distance	It's a little bit lighter.
ئی کەلیما و واتەی ئاڐیشا، ئا چێوە کە گەرەکش بێ واچۆ، واچێ	that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say	It's a word and it means something that you don't understand.
ئاواتوازەنا دلی بووڵێنە کەمیە تڵات ئێستەبۆوە	let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes.	I'm hoping there's more to it than that.
هەم دووبارە ئاڐەم جیا ئاستە، ئاڐەیچ بە شێویە ناحەز پەشتەو بەرەکەیش وست	I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.	I've seen it all over again, and it's over there with unreasonable pressure.
هەمیشە چاگەنە بێ، سەر و مێزیە میقلەیوە	which was always there, upon a little table	He's always on the table.
گۆچانەکێش ئاردە بەرەو کە بە شێویە سێحراوی بەرەکەی قوڵف کەرۆ	took out his wand to magically lock it.	she turned her head to look at him in a magical way.
واڵەکێش پەی کۆگەی لوابێ و چکۆنە	as to where she had gone or was now.	the money is in the warehouse and the bags are in the warehouse.
جە زەخم و لەگەنیش کۆم بێ	so bent was he by the wound in his hip.	I'm sick of it, and I'm sick of it.
من ئا کەسەنا کە خراو جۆریە بێ ملاحێزە بیەنا	I'm the one who was horribly careless.	I'm not the kind of person who doesn't have a mind.
هۆشش شیەبێوە ئا ئەسەرە کە وەڵتەر سەرشەو نیابێشەرە	but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days.	Because it's something he doesn't want to do at night.
زوو جیاش ئاستێ و لوا دلێ ئۆتاقەکەیش تا چێوەکاش هۆر گێرۆ	but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things.	He quickly climbed the ladder to the top of the hill.
فکرش کەردەو کە چننە سەختەن کە ئەڐاو بابە زیندێ با وەلێ نەشناساش	he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you.	He thought it was hard for him to know that he was alive.
بە ئێحترام و موحێبەتەو تێکەڵ بیەبێ	was tempered with respect and affection.	mixed with respect and affection.
واتش پەنە خەڵک یاردی بابەیەت دانشا و لواینێ شۆنەو شوەکەیتەرە	told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.	It means you're going to tell people about it and they're going to tell you about it.
مژە گێرتەبێشەرە و تەنیاییە گول کە نەتاوێ چەنەس بەر بشۆ زاڵ بیەبێ سەرشەرە	it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.	It's a very attractive, solitary flower that he can't control.
وەختیە دیشا چننە جە فکرە شێتانەکاش حەز کەرۆ	when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas	It's time for you to think again.
پسەو کەسیە کە بە قسەکەردەی عادەتش نیەن	as one unaccustomed to speaking	It's a person who doesn't speak the language of a common person.
بە دڵنیایی وە عەجیبتەرین چێو بێ	would certainly have been a most astonishing object	I'm sure it's curious.
توتەکەم نەڐیەبێ چا ڕۆوە کە لەمسم کەردەبێ	I hadn't seen my wolf in person since that day I'd touched him	I don't know if I'm going to make it.
یاوا بە یەرەمین کەسی واتش پەنە چیشش گەرەک بیەن	then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked the others	Or maybe it means something to you.
من فکرم کەرد شمە مشۆ زاندێ ئاڐ کۆگەرە ملۆ	I just thought you should know the direction he's headed.	I thought you knew it was a warehouse.
زانێ کە وەنیارەکە تیرەش واردێبێ	knew that the student had been shot.	He knows he's here.
گۆشش نەڐا چوون لەزەتش بێ پەیش	she let it pass because it was pleasing to her.	He's not here because he's not here.
ڕووبە دما گنۆ ملوو سەننەڵیەکەیشەرە	falling back in his chair	the face of his face was covered in a red clay.
وەختیە باشیش کەردە پۆرەشەرە، هەستیە وەشش دی دلێشەنە کە کەستەر نەبێش	yet when she put her arms around him she could sense a faint echo of some intensity quite missing in the others.	It's a good time for you, and you feel like you don't have time.
یەکڕا زەربیە تێژ واردش بە پەشتیم و هۆرگێلانێوە	when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round	I put my fingers between her fingers and her fingers.
حەتمەن عانوو نیشتەیرە هەواپەیماکەی کەوە بیەناوە	I must have bruised my ribs when the plane came in.	even if it's not an air conditioning service.
حەگەر قسەکاش پا لەحنە دەسش پەنە کەردەبێ، درێژە دایا	that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it	when he put his mouth to his mouth, it went on for a long time.
جە حاڵیەنە کە ئاڐێ چیلاوچەولامەو بێنێ، جە دەشتێ ویەردا	I crossed the field with them flanking me.	when he saw that he was going down the hill, he put his hand over it.

هیچیە دەسمەو نەبێ کە خیاڵم خجڵیۆ	I had not the smallest indication on which to let my imagination work.	I'm not afraid to dream about it.
چی موقەدەرەنە هامدەردیشا کەرد هەرچن کەم	who sympathized but little in the event	What's the opposite of what we're doing now?
وەشبین بێنا بە وەختیە گول کە مەی	the kind of vision I'd had of the bad time that's coming	I don't remember when I was there.
بە چنگ گێرتیە کە وەختەبێ دەس کەروو گرەوای	with a grip that almost made me cry out	with a glance that it's time for him to make a deal.
سەروو چوارپایەو پەشتەو مێزەکەیش نیشتەرە	sinking into his desk chair	He leaned his back on the table.
ئاڐ مشۆ بووسۆ، چارەش نیەن	he needed to sleep, he had to	It's over there, and there's no choice.
ئاڐ نەتاواش وەروو خوایش گێرۆ	though he couldn't suppress a thin lipped smile.	for he could not leave God alone.
