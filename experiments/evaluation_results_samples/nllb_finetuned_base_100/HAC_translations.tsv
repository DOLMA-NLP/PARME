گردوو نۆکەرەکاش واق مەنێبێنێرە	all his attendants were in the same state of amazement.	But the darkest part of the story is not true.
گاهەز تاوو کەشتیەکەی گێڵنوو وە پەی ساحیوەکەیش	I might return the vessel to her captain.	so he left the ship and the ship behind him.
فکر نەکەرێناوە چیگەنە وینووت بۆنەو ئانەیوە کەمیە پەشێویانێ	but I so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me	he hadn't thought about what he had just said.
بە جۆریە سەیر و سەمەرە مارکەوتەرە سەر و زەمینی	miraculously the snake slumped to the floor	in a mysterious and mysterious way.
ئەڐاش دوێ کەڕەتێ یاردیش دا	his mother helped him out twice	Then he came to his rescue.
بە یەکڕایی فکریە ئاما مەژگشەرە	when suddenly the idea occurred to him	It doesn't have a single point of view.
وەلێ ئاڐە کەم قوێ بێ پەی جوڵیایوە	but she was too weak to move.	But he had a few moments of stillness.
وەڵترەری فرەتەر جە چیویە بێ کە قەرار بێ هۆرش گێرۆ	was already more than she was meant to carry.	But the best response was that of a man who had no choice but to settle for life.
فکرش کەرد کە خاستەرەن چیویە نەواچۆ و بۆنەو ئینەیوە گرد چێوش حاشا کەرد	he thought it best to say nothing and so for the timebeing had denied everything	he thought that he had lost his sense of smell, and that he had lost his sense of smell.
بازدێ با مۆڵەتش دریۆ کە سەروو ژیوای، ئازادی و سامان و مەردمیرە زاڵ بۆ!	let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes of his people!	so that he may have life, liberty, and property, and possessions.
خۆزگەی زانایام قەرارەن چە ئێحساسیەم بۆ	I wished I knew what I was supposed to be feeling.	I wish I had something to tell you.
ئا پیا کە بە تازەیی لوا چانەی مشۆ کە شۆخ بۆ	that is, the gentleman who has just gone appears to have an immoderate sense of humour.	It's like he's got a new face that he's been wearing since he was a kid.
عانیە لوایمێ گرد و ئا چێواشە پەی شی کەرداوە	all of which he explained to me as we went along.	He had a face made of silk.
ئەگەر زوو نەیاوایا ئاگە، جلەکاش پیس کەرێ	if she didn't get there soon she was going to stain her dress.	if he hadn't come sooner, he'd have made his clothes dirty.
سەرەم تەکان داو وەروو لەرزای وێم بۆنەو ئانەیوە کە ئارۆ فرەش نەمەنەبێ دێر کەروو، گێرت	I shook my head and repressed a shudder at the thought of how close I had been to being too late today.	I'm afraid I won't be able to keep my head up.
من بێ تۆ نەتاوێنا ئینیشا گردی ویاروو	I I just couldn't have gone through all this without you.	I'm not going anywhere without you.
دەنگشەرە دیار بێ کە هۆشش هەن پوەشە	his voice promised that he would take care of her	It was as if he was conscious.
نیشانە مڐۆ کە دوانزە سەرئاشپەزێ ماتڵ و دەسوور و ئاڐێ نێ	implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.	It's a sign that he's got a dozen different faces.
ئەڐام کە هۆشش بێ، ڕیک ژنەوتش و بە ناڕاحەتیوە هوشیارە بێ	which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.	I'm sure he'll be aware of it, but he's also very aware of it.
من لوێنا پەی لایش و گرد لایەوە چەنیش بێنا	I'd have gone to see her and gone about with her everywhere.	I came up to him in the middle of the hill.
بە یەکڕایی تەقەو چێر و بەرەی ئاما	when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.	he was in a state of confusion.
جە حاڵیەنە کە سەر و سینەو بابەیشە و پاڵ کەوتێبێ، بە جوڵەو سەرەی واتش بەڵێ	but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father's breast	as if he had come to his senses, and had come to his senses, and had come to his senses, and had come to his senses, and had come to his senses, and to his senses, and to his senses, and to his senses, and to his senses, and to his senses, and to his senses, and to his senses, and to the senses of his senses.
چۆرچەمش یەکجار ئارام بێ	his face was quite composed.	I felt a moment of calm.
چوون شۆنەو ونێ دیار بێ	for there was traces of blood	he was out of sight.
من چیویەم پەی واتەی بە شمە هەن	I have something to tell you.	I've got a lot of meaning in my ears.
شۆنیشەرە ئێ و ئاواتێش بە تەمامی بە دی ئارێ	she would come in search of him and meet his wishes unreservedly.	I'm looking for you and you're looking for me.
مدرابێرە و بە وردی چەمش بڕیەبێ ئی سەرەیە	so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.	he was very well educated and well educated.
کەمیە چەولاتەرەو ماتڵ بی	but lingered at a little distance	It's a slightly lighter color.
ئی کەلیما و واتەی ئاڐیشا، ئا چێوە کە گەرەکش بێ واچۆ، واچێ	that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say	It has a climate and a meaning, but it doesn't have a sound.
ئاواتوازەنا دلی بووڵێنە کەمیە تڵات ئێستەبۆوە	let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes.	But he was in a very short space of time.
هەم دووبارە ئاڐەم جیا ئاستە، ئاڐەیچ بە شێویە ناحەز پەشتەو بەرەکەیش وست	I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.	I'm in a state of confusion again, and I'm in a state of unnecessary stress.
هەمیشە چاگەنە بێ، سەر و مێزیە میقلەیوە	which was always there, upon a little table	he was always at the table.
گۆچانەکێش ئاردە بەرەو کە بە شێویە سێحراوی بەرەکەی قوڵف کەرۆ	took out his wand to magically lock it.	he turned his head to the side of the golf course, where he stood in a magnificent manner.
واڵەکێش پەی کۆگەی لوابێ و چکۆنە	as to where she had gone or was now.	It's in the repository.
جە زەخم و لەگەنیش کۆم بێ	so bent was he by the wound in his hip.	I was in a lot of pain.
من ئا کەسەنا کە خراو جۆریە بێ ملاحێزە بیەنا	I'm the one who was horribly careless.	I'm not the kind of person who's in a bad mood.
هۆشش شیەبێوە ئا ئەسەرە کە وەڵتەر سەرشەو نیابێشەرە	but he had completely forgotten the impression it had made on him in old days.	It's like he's out of his mind that he doesn't want to sleep at night.
زوو جیاش ئاستێ و لوا دلێ ئۆتاقەکەیش تا چێوەکاش هۆر گێرۆ	but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things.	so he went up to the side of the mountain.
فکرش کەردەو کە چننە سەختەن کە ئەڐاو بابە زیندێ با وەلێ نەشناساش	he imagined how it must feel to have parents still living but unable to recognize you.	he thought they were so hard that he didn't know who they were.
بە ئێحترام و موحێبەتەو تێکەڵ بیەبێ	was tempered with respect and affection.	he was accompanied by a man of good will and kindness.
واتش پەنە خەڵک یاردی بابەیەت دانشا و لواینێ شۆنەو شوەکەیتەرە	told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband.	It means you're going to help people, and you're going to get up and sit down.
مژە گێرتەبێشەرە و تەنیاییە گول کە نەتاوێ چەنەس بەر بشۆ زاڵ بیەبێ سەرشەرە	it was as though a fog had fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there was no escape.	It's a very confusing and lonely woman who can't stand being washed.
وەختیە دیشا چننە جە فکرە شێتانەکاش حەز کەرۆ	when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas	But he had time to think about what he was doing.
پسەو کەسیە کە بە قسەکەردەی عادەتش نیەن	as one unaccustomed to speaking	It's the back of someone who doesn't have a normal tone of voice.
بە دڵنیایی وە عەجیبتەرین چێو بێ	would certainly have been a most astonishing object	I'm sure it's interesting.
توتەکەم نەڐیەبێ چا ڕۆوە کە لەمسم کەردەبێ	I hadn't seen my wolf in person since that day I'd touched him	I hadn't even had a cup of tea.
یاوا بە یەرەمین کەسی واتش پەنە چیشش گەرەک بیەن	then passing on to the third he asked him what he had asked the others	I don't know what I'm doing now.
من فکرم کەرد شمە مشۆ زاندێ ئاڐ کۆگەرە ملۆ	I just thought you should know the direction he's headed.	I thought you were out of your mind.
زانێ کە وەنیارەکە تیرەش واردێبێ	knew that the student had been shot.	he knows that he has a secretary.
گۆشش نەڐا چوون لەزەتش بێ پەیش	she let it pass because it was pleasing to her.	But they didn't eat their meat.
ڕووبە دما گنۆ ملوو سەننەڵیەکەیشەرە	falling back in his chair	the face of a man with a dark face.
وەختیە باشیش کەردە پۆرەشەرە، هەستیە وەشش دی دلێشەنە کە کەستەر نەبێش	yet when she put her arms around him she could sense a faint echo of some intensity quite missing in the others.	It's a good time for you, and it's a sad feeling that you're not going to make it.
یەکڕا زەربیە تێژ واردش بە پەشتیم و هۆرگێلانێوە	when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and turning round	I was shouted out in the middle of the night.
حەتمەن عانوو نیشتەیرە هەواپەیماکەی کەوە بیەناوە	I must have bruised my ribs when the plane came in.	At least he's got a message from the air.
حەگەر قسەکاش پا لەحنە دەسش پەنە کەردەبێ، درێژە دایا	that if he continued the conversation in the same tone in which he had begun it	If he hadn't said a word, it would have been a long time.
جە حاڵیەنە کە ئاڐێ چیلاوچەولامەو بێنێ، جە دەشتێ ویەردا	I crossed the field with them flanking me.	when he came to see me, he was afraid of me.

وەشبین بێنا بە وەختیە گول کە مەی	the kind of vision I'd had of the bad time that's coming	But we didn't think about it for a moment.
بە چنگ گێرتیە کە وەختەبێ دەس کەروو گرەوای	with a grip that almost made me cry out	It's a good sign that he's willing to bet on it.
سەروو چوارپایەو پەشتەو مێزەکەیش نیشتەرە	sinking into his desk chair	she was sitting on the side of the table.
ئاڐ مشۆ بووسۆ، چارەش نیەن	he needed to sleep, he had to	It's all over, and there's nothing left to do.

شوەکەش جواوش داوە	her husband countered.	he answered.

هەرچن ئاڐ ئەننە ئەدەبش بێ کە نەتاوێ ئاشکرا واچۆش	though he was too courteous to speak openly	I'm afraid you won't tell me what you're doing.
