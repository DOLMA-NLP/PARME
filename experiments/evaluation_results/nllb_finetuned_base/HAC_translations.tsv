بە یەکڕایی فکریە ئاما مەژگشەرە	when suddenly the idea occurred to him	pointing to his brain at once.
وەلێ ئاڐە کەم قوێ بێ پەی جوڵیایوە	but she was too weak to move.	but she had little room for movement.
وەڵترەری فرەتەر جە چیویە بێ کە قەرار بێ هۆرش گێرۆ	was already more than she was meant to carry.	there was more to it than meets the eye.

بە یەکڕایی تەقەو چێر و بەرەی ئاما	when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.	knocked sharply on the door.
جە حاڵیەنە کە سەر و سینەو بابەیشە و پاڵ کەوتێبێ، بە جوڵەو سەرەی واتش بەڵێ	but she made an affirmative sign with her head as she lay on her father's breast	he said yes, with a movement of his head.
چۆرچەمش یەکجار ئارام بێ	his face was quite composed.	my eyes closed for a moment.
