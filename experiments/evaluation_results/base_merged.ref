The love of life have made him blind
You look straight into his eyes
Bless them that they've written good poems
But we did not talk about the pear tree
We don't call because of compassion or conscience
I see a shortcoming here
Language work needs to be open to discussion and critique
When there is no water, cleanliness will be removed from the world's surface
You made it a ruin
But we are not without hope
At last, it ends slowly
Erdogan becomes more and more authoritarian
The attack like this because they want to re-open our wounds
Their love is very tender
By God, I saw that a couple of homepages were lined up
A laborious father
It turns out you are not guilty whatsoever
Either marriage or death!
There is every type of food
We had started in 1993
That is, their leader
It is the turkification of the Kurds
It made me so happy, I can't tell it right now
A mother's courage is a moral courage
This terminology demages us Kurds
Everybody knows that the life of us Kurds is trauma all through
That's why we have to do this task
Whoever can, shall sing our songs
Nodody looked at us
This mentality is afraid that women organize themselves and put up a fight
We gave out food for all three days
In Turkey, they don't value our language
This tree is one hundred years old
I phoned
His hous has two stores
Everything is in our hands
My grandfather doesn't allow it
I took a untruthful loce into my bed
It's dark everywhere and a cold wind is blowing
After a long journey, he reaches the village
I showed interest in language after 2007
But didn't look at himself
The other gets angy and flees
My intention was to publish it as a book
That's why there was always satire in my life
The circassians were always talking
At that time, only love cried for us
Something like that cannot become the answer to the praise and meaning of my life
May he rest in peace
Neither you know him nor does he know you
You were saying that there was no one inside
Now they sell more fruit trees
I don't know whether he/she hat any sons or daughters
The Kurdish language's living space are the villages and the nature
I.e., every part has its own miniature
If winter comes, they will stay snowed in for four to five months
You were expressing yourself with these words
Like that, a deep valley has been built
Last year, I started a new project
I have not seen him smile one day
We are saluting this soul
If you ask me, poetry is life itself
Somethings are in our control
He cannot write or read
That's why the enemy cannot win like that
We shall focus on these methods
That course which was started by the administration
We are going to object that one
He/She should act according to the rules
and his/her daughter was wounded
Also, we have a lot of stories and tales
All fighting women prevailed
A TV that broadcasts in Kurdish throughout
It turns out she is the daughter of my friend
I am in darkness
I am a philosophy teacher
All are connected
From your eyes, the smell of my village emerges
He cleaned his eyes and his face with snow powder
Mehemed takes his rifle and fires it at the sky
The night's dominion ends and the morning starts
Truly, we Kurds don't think in the written word
My sky and my earth are changing places
He says tohimself "I can't accomplish that"
The wounded have been brought to the hospital
I don't have eyes in the darkness
It has to do with cinema
The Turkish state is violating human rights
The Turks copied it from Persian and Arabic
This song also brings forth the longing of my people
We cannot give water to the animals
Of course they knew everything
First, turned around
He was one of the elders of the Kurêşan tribe
I gave
We want that our institutions do give financial support for cultural and language works
Signs that depict sounds and phonemes are called letters
With their questions, they animated the symposium
You and I, we had talked on the phone regarding some songs
What do you say?
Yes
Hecî was appreciating everybody
The local press also didn't give any attention
Now we understand each other
How many cadres did he/she/they train?
I am a Kurmanj
He did not talk to his satisfaction
So, Soranî is now really the official dialect of the Kurds
You collected folk tales
Take care
As a result of both courses, many people started writing in Zazakî
One could say that our situation is like modern slavery
In Kurdistan, their place is more separate and special
They won't let the students catch a break
Where is unity?
We will escape this crisis together and get rid of the state system
For freedom women are of value
But at that time, neither did I know the alphabet nor the grammar of Zazakî
Anyways, this is also not possible
This month, there were many martyrdoms alongside the resistance
But wrote his/her poems and hid them somewhere
Because writers are being educated in the newspaper
Made it very long
Now I am independent
We say that it is enough already
Also, not everyone's opinion can be the same with regards to the origins of the Zazas
The most important thing is an independent press for women
In this article, there are important informations
A strong service must be done to protect women
It hasn't rained yet
In this war, it is mostly women and children who suffer
We started the usage of Kurdish
Gaxan is a thousand year old tradition
My son is now in solitary confinement
These walls were in the way of our forefathers
They are in the courts; abusing our justice
That's why such an endeavor gives us pleasure
Say, why is it in this photograph?
So come and solve it!
The existence of the Kurmanji dialect is enough the Kurds!
I shall relax a bit
Supporting the Kurds is a duty for me
It is necessary that we make the language sweet for children
As difficult as being a porter
Such beautiful roses they are that bloomed on that throne
But I was always pleased to bring out a book
Were talking about eye color
It is unfortunate that the people's joy was not fullfilled
Our guide has taken a historical stance
In a process like this, we share our responsibility with the community
When it comes to language, children are looking for comfort
Because the newer generations don't speak the language anymore
I thought he was going to say hello but he didn't
At last, my language is sprouting in the water
Men had a lot of liberties
Stand up, go home
Until when?
It was raining sometimes
For two-three hours didn't stay in place
The issues with women and children increased
As if he/she hasn't eaten in days
In the book, the life and songs of Dengbêjs are featured
They wanted their voices to go from these page and reach other places
Until I was seven or eight years old, I grew up amid my own culture and language
First grade until eight grade is primary school
They were saying that they are going to exterminate us
The fugitives showed their discontent with the camp administration and started a hunger strike
We were desperate to migrate
But I have shortcomings
Partly, he/she only have his/her address
Women did not receive equal pay before the economic crisis, either
That is, the discussion is being made by various people
On these streams, there are many falls and lakes
I didn't remember her
I do not find pleasure in a wild life
We worked together for two years
Those who claim to be democrats should raise their hand in face of this injustice
This cannot be accepted
Approximately ten workers where standing in front of the oven
And his/her name is Armenian, as well
God knows how I raised her
They are killing the Barmakids
And we are ten people
We can win!
If it comes to that, the order changes
It's a strategic place that holds importance
This is our reality
It was something very heavy
It is said that the mother tongue is the foundation of one's identity
A lot of people started writing and advanced their writing
It doesn't work another way
PKK erased that from every mind
After breakfast, he/she made us clean the periphery of the school
We apply, but they don't give us a hall
In his/her stories, he/she stalks about laborers
But, according to old sayings, this ctiy was a soul of nature
The whole world is emptying prisoners in the context of the pandemic
This is our place of worship
Death is the master of his craft
More and more, Kurdish becomes less preferred for speaking
As if they regret their going
The government buildings open at the earlierst at eight o'clock
They came here to hide themselves
Because here is a war zone and already, every illness was present
The center of his eyers were wide and open
He washed his hands and face and drinks a bit of water
I encourage the people via charts to stay at home
The teacher streched out his hand to catch him/her, but could not
They made the Kurds believe that the situation is like that
He/she opened the scarf around the neck
Stop complaining
Build in Diyarbakir
Some know that
He studies English in the language departement of the university
We were tasting it
And the younglings crack their eggs open and get out
A goal like I come here or go there, does not exist
They went and went!
Our work now continues to promote the album
It was very inappropriate!
Each group must not consist of more than ten people
They don't mingle much with the people and don't walk around the cities
Solitary confinment must be removed
Oh mother!
This is deceit
I read the same news
Your love brought the seas into my world
Since that day, the strike continues
There are millions of Kurds in the world
Give me a place within
Sometimes there is no water to drink for us
It was pitchblack inside
But it was of no use
Kemal has tried some political tactics.
In some stories, his speeches have the flavor of poetry.
The sister regrets very much not believing her brother.
I want to take the university exam this year.
Both brothers ruled their country together.
Our people should take this period seriously.
Everything in Sur is political and oppositional.
Just listen up.
You know that our language is in a critical state.
I have never seen such a drought in my life.
I took part in amateur groups.
One soldier was killed as a result of the operation.
The trustees cannot meet the needs of the people.
That hospital has just started operating.

Sometimes he would pay the laborers for them to dig his vineyard.
I became interested in translation later

550 families have applied to us.
When he swears, he truely dies
My aim was to show the seeds.
Now I feed my soul in your body.
Jiyan/e is a Kurdish name and is not illegal or prohibited.
We reject this view and say it has nothing to do with reality.
I'll give him/her/it a few slaps.
Thanks to the Dengbêjs, many stories have survived through songs and folk songs and Kurdish culture has remained alive.
Did not put up much limit
I was being thrown into the darkness.
The mail of the villages was always distributed through that bakery.
However, we had created this alphabet entirely according to the needs of the Romani language.
But not a peep from this man.
I am the essence of an honorable people.
The biggest deficiency in this regard belongs to adults.
Because he got us used to sugar.
We must not normalize these wrongdoings and ignore them.
After all, it is the Kurds who do the heaviest work in serving the Turks.
It is only with the help of Turkish that one can understand Kurmanji.
For women, male domination is worse than the plague.
Then, the features of the Kurdish alphabet are explained.
Education and science were conducted only in Latin.
They don't allow us to come together, but no one can break our unity.
Why only the incomplete form?

All three peoples marched with their own symbols.
I only wish that we could, like other peoples, take the opportunity to compile all our folklore in a timely manner.
This is also a fact of the Kurdish language.
He supported his household by working as a porter.
Women also took part in the construction of houses.
Since they are afraid of us, they are resorting to the method of usurpation.
In a society that does not educate itself, the development of political institutions and basic morality disappears.
My birds left my ashes.
By God, this nature will take its revenge on us.
Why don't we kick him out of the country?
The village was surrounded by vineyards.
Women all over the world are targeted by dominant forces.
But the judgment of autumn is like the judgment of death.
Those who are responsible must be prosecuted.
Maybe the owner's voice had been in his ear before.
And of course there are challenges in this work.
They neither take us to the hospital nor bring a doctor here.
Of course, this bride's veil is not red but green.
They say that a Kirdas and a Laz travel together.
He always had a smile on his face, hope in his mind and faith in freedom in his heart.
God knows, but maybe they will starve to death.
I also grew up with my brother.
His murderers will be held to account.
And his/her immigration?
I am here not talking about dialectal form.
Nothing right could be expected from the men of an already rotten system.
This cannot happen with a self-interested and cheap mentality.
Some were arrested.
The weather is clear that night.
Like everyone else here, we also want to return to our village.
Her roses were very red and beautiful.

They looked at me still in astonishment
You are still a child

He is a Turk
Nobody understood you
Reality needs to be seen and known in this way
His mud grey
Petitions get ignored
Are you satisfied?
Salih gets very happy
After 5 months, he becomes a martyr
He wants society to accept this
And for that, the do nothing

But does not understand anything from that
He is very thrilled about that

That's how it is

He flees, too
I talk a bit long
For that reason, I remaind without eyes

Our people stand up against this practices
How were they taking the stage?
Women need to unify their strength
And we explain

The author worked on his text with significance
Our guide wanted to follow and evaluate this proses in a truthful way
The ministry had not accepted this
I fear the darkness very much
He has more novels in Turkish
The teacher is angry with him/her
We had a friend who was 4-5 years older han us
Their national politics is like that
I was curious and asked
His/her hair were black like the night
Our people is always massacred and incarcerated
May this rebellion never end.
But, in essence, I learned a lot from this story.
Silence encapsulated me
It is enough for today
The Yezidis' holidays represent nature
I mostly don't understand Sorani and Zazaki
Later, we will decipher it for you
She was handsome
She is my daughter
Whom shall we prove ourselves!
Suddenly, the mouse catches sight of the cat.
However, there are rules to the language!

On the way to liberation!

I was commenting on him
We did this bad thing to ourselves
I am the oldest of them.
They knew that cinema is very influental propaganda

In Amed, the number of sick people grows
The Kurdish nation is a colorful nation.
We were in the same team.
For this task, experience and time are necessary

That was the calculation.
He was jealous.
In my dream I was in a blurry place.

The reason for this is not being educated in the mother tongue.
The old woman's braids are long.
The most important are the owners of politics.

He goes out and what does he see!
The women's movement is developing and getting stronger every day, challenging the male-dominated system.

These are a Kurdish tribe.
The PKK was also denounced as a terrorist organization.
That's too bad.
But I wonder.
What about the other people?
And you had the right principles.
This work, too, is a matter of diplomacy.
