گاهەز تاوو کەشتیەکەی گێڵنوو وە پەی ساحیوەکەیش	I might return the vessel to her captain.	Perhaps to get the ship off the coast and take it to the center of the ship.
فکر نەکەرێناوە چیگەنە وینووت بۆنەو ئانەیوە کەمیە پەشێویانێ	but I so little expected your visit that it has somewhat overcome me	I didn't think I could see it, and it didn't take long for me to get used to it.
بە جۆریە سەیر و سەمەرە مارکەوتەرە سەر و زەمینی	miraculously the snake slumped to the floor	He looked at the ground and touched it on the cheek.
ئەڐاش دوێ کەڕەتێ یاردیش دا	his mother helped him out twice	He's going to pay two backwardly.
بە یەکڕایی فکریە ئاما مەژگشەرە	when suddenly the idea occurred to him	He's thinking of it.
وەلێ ئاڐە کەم قوێ بێ پەی جوڵیایوە	but she was too weak to move.	But he had gone back and forth with all politeness.
وەڵترەری فرەتەر جە چیویە بێ کە قەرار بێ هۆرش گێرۆ	was already more than she was meant to carry.	more cotton than he was supposed to have.
فکرش کەرد کە خاستەرەن چیویە نەواچۆ و بۆنەو ئینەیوە گرد چێوش حاشا کەرد	he thought it best to say nothing and so for the timebeing had denied everything	He thought he had better say something and say something else.

دەنگشەرە دیار بێ کە هۆشش هەن پوەشە	his voice promised that he would take care of her	it sounded like he was thinking.
نیشانە مڐۆ کە دوانزە سەرئاشپەزێ ماتڵ و دەسوور و ئاڐێ نێ	implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.	in a tone that seemed to imply that the girl hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get up.
ئەڐام کە هۆشش بێ، ڕیک ژنەوتش و بە ناڕاحەتیوە هوشیارە بێ	which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.	then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the consciousness of his wife

مدرابێرە و بە وردی چەمش بڕیەبێ ئی سەرەیە	so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.	Then he cut his hair off his face and looked at it.
کەمیە چەولاتەرەو ماتڵ بی	but lingered at a little distance	A few more feathers fell out of its tail.
ئی کەلیما و واتەی ئاڐیشا، ئا چێوە کە گەرەکش بێ واچۆ، واچێ	that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say	"So he spoke to them and said to them, ""What I need to say is Lie down here""."
ئاواتوازەنا دلی بووڵێنە کەمیە تڵات ئێستەبۆوە	let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes.	I wish your heart weren't so dumb that you couldn't talk about it.
هەم دووبارە ئاڐەم جیا ئاستە، ئاڐەیچ بە شێویە ناحەز پەشتەو بەرەکەیش وست	I then quitted her again, and she drew the bolt in one of her worst, most peevish humours.	And he stood in the midst of his saddle, and took hold of the saddle.
